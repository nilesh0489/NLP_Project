By developing the first high-definition streaming video platform of Earth, UrtheCast plans to change the way we view the world. With the help of prominent aerospace partners like RSC Energia, UrtheCast is building, launching, installing, and operating two cameras onboard the International Space Station.

In first half of 2013, video of Earth will begin streaming across the globe. Everyone from web surfers and smartphone users, to media representatives and agriculturists, will be able to use the UrtheCast platform to see world events unfold in near real-time. App developers will have access to open source Earth video data, while educators will be able to harness rich video for their lesson plans. What’s more, environmental monitoring services and humanitarian relief organizations will have access to dynamic imagery as an additional tool in their relief efforts.
