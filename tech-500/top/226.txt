Lenovo has reported another set of extremely healthy financial results this morning, and with the earnings report claimed to be the world's largest consumer PC and laptop supplier. The company's PC sales have consistently grown ahead of market rates over the past three and a half years, and in the last quarter grew by eleven percent year-over-year. In contrast, the consumer PC market as a whole shrank by eight percent over the same period. The growth contributed towards record quarterly sales totaling $8.7 billion and a pre-tax income of $204 million.

The company says it will continue to push towards becoming the number one vendor in the PC industry — a lofty goal that some analysts predicted it had already achieved. It recently launched a number of new products to take advantage of Windows 8's enhanced touch capabilities including the ThinkPad Tablet 2 and 11- and 13-inch IdeaPad Yoga.
