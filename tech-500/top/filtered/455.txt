Google is looking to one-up that iPad's Retina display

Apple may be looking to crush the competition's hopes of taking over the 7" tablet market with its upcoming iPad Mini , but Google is looking to grab a few headlines of its own on Monday, October 29. According to The Next Web, Google will officially unveil a 32GB version of its popular Nexus 7 tablet . The device has already turned up in stores across the U.S. and some lucky people have even been able to purchase the device , which is priced at $249 (the same price as the previous 16GB model). In addition, there will also be another 32GB Nexus 7 that will feature 3G connectivity. This device will most likely be aimed right at Amazon's 8.9" Kindle Fire HD LTE 4G (say that three times fast). The star of the show, however, will be Google's new 10" tablet that was developed in conjunction with Samsung. This tablet will come bearing Android 4.2 (still operating under the Jelly Bean codename) and a Retina-surpassing resolution of 2560x1600 (300 ppi). Apple's "New iPad" features a screen resolution of 2048x1536 (264 ppi). The device will likely be called the Nexus 10. We don't have any specs to report on at this time other than the screen, but we can only assume that it'll be packing a quad-core processor and at least 64GB of storage space at the high-end.
