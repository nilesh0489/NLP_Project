Google and Samsung will announce a new 10-inch tablet codenamed "Manta" at its October 29thevent, according to The Next Web. If the site's unnamed sources are to be believed the Manta will feature a 10-inch 2560 x 1600 display with an iPad-beating pixel density of around 300ppi. The tablet, which if real will likely be released as the Nexus 10, will reportedly be sold alongside the existing Asus Nexus 7 and new LG Nexus 4 as part of a multi-manufacturer Nexus program. There aren't any further details on the purported Nexus 10; processor and pricing will be key to the tablet's success.

At the same event, Google will announce a slight refresh to its Nexus 7 line, bringing HSPA+ 3G connectivity to the tablet for the first time, as well as the now-confirmed internal storage bump. The Next Web also reports that both the Nexus 4 and Nexus 10 will launch with an updated OS, Android 4.2. It named "content in the center" (a new Play Store Widget), "Tablet Sharing" (multiple user accounts on one device), and horizontal and vertical panoramic photo capture as headline features for the new OS. It's not clear if Google will release 4.2 under a new codename or if it will still be named Jelly Bean. Although, as with any rumor, these details should be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism, The Next Web seems pretty certain that its sources are accurate.
