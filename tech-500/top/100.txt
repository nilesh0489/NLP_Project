Apple and Samsung took their intellectual property spat all the way to the Court of Appeal in the UK, where recently it was affirmed that the latter company's range of Galaxy tablets did not infringe on the former's design rights with respect to the iPad. As part of the original High Court ruling, Apple was required to post an acknowledgement to its website, in a font no smaller than Arial 11, stating that Samsung's hardware does not in fact copy Apple's tablet design. The Court of Appeal softened that requirement a little, stating that just a link to the acknowledgement on Apple's homepage would be sufficient, which the American company has now dutifully produced on its UK landing page.

The more amusing aspect of the ruling should come when the minimum font size gets cranked up to Arial 14 as Apple is forced to also get the same notice printed in a number of big UK publications, including the Financial Times and The Guardian. This is all in an effort to reverse the damaging (for Samsung) impression created by the original injunction that Apple obtained against its Korean competitor. Still, Apple's made sure to include a couple of paragraphs' worth of quotes from the UK judiciary that highlight the strengths of its design, while also pointing out its victories in Germany and, most famously, in the United States, closing off with the following statement:

"So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad."
