You’ve seen 360-degree, panoramic photos before. You may have even taken a few with the latest Android release or iOS app. But what you haven’t experienced is the fully controlled, immersive 360-degree video on offer from Making View.

The Norwegian company released its latest collaboration with Red Bull, fitting the firm’s custom-developed camera system atop one of the energy drink dynasty’s F1 cars and giving driver Sébastien Buemi a chance to tackle the track.

The result is the video above, which allows you to pan around the circuit using your keyboard or mouse as Buemi canes the open-wheeled racer up and over 200 MPH.

Considering motorsports coverage hasn’t kept pace with the technological advances enjoyed by football, basketball and baseball fans, this has the potential to bring racing action into the 21st century – assuming you’re basking in a steady stream of high-speed bandwidth.
