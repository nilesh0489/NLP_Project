Termintaor Arm Dad ! A father who lost his arm in an accident six years ago has been given a new lease of life by a hi-tech bionic hand which is so precise he can even type again! (also, i'd suggest not fooling around with this man's daughter) Nigel Ackland, 53, has been fitted with the Terminator-like carbon fibre mechanical hand which he can control with movements in his upper arm. The new bebionic3 myoelectric hand, which is also made from aluminium and alloy knuckles, moves like a real human limb by responding to Nigel's muscle twitches. Incredibly, the robotic arm is so sensitive it means the father-of-one can touch type on a computer keyboard, peel vegetables, and even dress himself for the first time in six years.Last modified: Nov-5-2012
