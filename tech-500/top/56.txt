There are two kinds of Facebook (FB) users out there: Those who use their pages as political soap boxes and those who are sick of people using their pages as political soap boxes. For the latter group, the folks at Buzzfeed and Unbaby.me have helped create a new extension for Google (GOOG) Chrome that blocks political messages from both your Facebook and Twitter feeds and replaces them with happier things, such as pictures of cute cats. The extension is free to download and promises users that it will help them “enjoy an Obama AND Romney free life.”
