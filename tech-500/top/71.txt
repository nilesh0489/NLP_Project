Kim Dotcom is still fighting a legal battle in New Zealand against the United States over alleged copyright infringement and piracy.

Kim Dotcom's upcoming Mega website Me.ga has had its domain name seized by the African nation of Gabon, with a government minister saying his country will not be used as a base for copyright infringement.

Last week, Dotcom unveiled plans to relaunch his file-sharing site in January 2013, using the Gabonese domain me.ga, with the message "this button will change the world." "Gabon cannot serve as a platform or screen for committing acts aimed at violating copyrights, nor be used by unscrupulous people," says the country's Communication Minister Blaise Louembe.
