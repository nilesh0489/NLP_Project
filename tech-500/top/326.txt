(Phys.org)—Fujifilm is working on a new recording method for optical discs. It has developed the new method through the use of two-photon absorption in order to generate heat, and the report in TechOn! notes that this two-photon method is suited for multilayer discs. As the reaction caused by two-photon absorption can be limited to the small area of the focal point of a laser light, it is possible to increase the number of recording layers. The nuance is that Fujifilm has combined a two-photon absorption method with a "heat-mode recording" method. The latter refers to technology that makes the most of a phenomenon where a change is caused by applying a laser light with a high energy density to instantaneously increase the temperature of a minute area of a recording material. Two-photon absorption refers to the simultaneous absorption of two photons of identical or different frequencies to excite a molecule from one state to a higher energy electronic state.
