Read an article about this machine here:http://www.mechatronic.me/automation/37-automatically-sort-skittles-or-mms-by...This is a machine I designed to sort Skittles. It uses a BASIC Stamp 2 and 3 servos for actuation. An IR LED and phototransistor are used to stop the turnstile in position. I fabricated may of the parts from epoxy including the body, the turnstile, the chute header, etc. The base is wood and the funnel is from a hummingbird feeder. The rest is made from telescope parts and PVC. I've made some recent modifications to the machine. Now the color detection stage is visible and I painted some previously unfinished parts.The machine works with Reese's Pieces as well as m&ms. However since it was originally designed for Skittles there are only 5 bowls, but 6 colors of m&ms. I put the blue and brown m&ms in the same bowl.
