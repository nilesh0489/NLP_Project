dutch design firm studio roosegaarde and heleen herbert from heijmans infrastructure have presented the first prototypes of their 'smart highway' development. awarded with a ‘best future concept’ by the dutch design awards, the idea will be realized mid-2013 in the netherlands. using the latest techniques, the team is dedicated in building roads that are more sustainable,  safe and interactive for both drivers and builders.

instead of focusing on the car to innovate the driving experience, roosegaarde and heijmans found it about time to innovate the highways. with smarter transportation research already disposable for use for decades, an implementation plan capable of updating the highway with new designs such as a 'glow-in-the-dark road', 'dynamic paints', 'interactive lights', 'induction priority lanes' and 'wind lights'. the system essentially creates roads that are more socially conscious and interactive through the inclusion of light, energy and road signs which automatically adapt to various traffic situations.

the lines are painted with a glow-in-the-dark powder giving light up to 10 hours

the dynamic paint only becomes visible in specific situation, making highway signs relevant to driving context
