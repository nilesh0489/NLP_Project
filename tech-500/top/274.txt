Next time you receive a new card from your bank, don't be surprised if it has a keypad and LCD on it.

It's MasterCard's new "Display Card", which basically combines the usual credit/debit or ATM card with an authentication token. The authentication portion features a touch-sensitive keypad and LCD display--hence the name "Display Card"--for reflecting a one-time password (OTP).

Yet, according to MasterCard, the "Display Card" looks and functions almost exactly like a regular credit, debit or ATM card.

Currently, many banks issue a separate authentication token for online banking services, particularly high-risk transactions, such as payments or transfers above a certain amount, adding payees or changing personal details. The new 2-in-1 cards would hence eliminate the hassle of carrying a separate authentication device--good news for guys who carry their whole lives in their pockets.

Besides generating OTPs, the "Display Card" may be able to show your available credit balance, reward points or even recent transactions in the future.

Along with some European banks, only Standard Chartered has announced the Display Card for some of its customers in Singapore for now.
