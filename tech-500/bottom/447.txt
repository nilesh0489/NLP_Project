This comparison is complete ignorance to how the stock market works. Companies split and combine stocks, if Microsoft wanted, it could combine every 200 stocks into 1, thus resulting in each share costing $5614. Apple rarely splits their stocks, if I remember correctly they have only combined them. Apple still has Microsoft beat in Market value by a good amount, and posting those numbers would have been a more reasonable comparison than share prices.
