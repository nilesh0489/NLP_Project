The six strikes plan is a threat to the internet and our culture. These morons are trying to stack the deck against innovation and progress. We don't have to take it.

There were a few things that didn't make the cut in the video that I would like to mention here. Another issue with the Six Strikes plan is that is claims to be about protecting content creators and copyright holders, however it only protects "big media". Indie artists are left with no protection. I mean, is anyone going to care if you download a Zweihander torrent.

Most indie artists do not want this "protection" anyway. They understand that sharing is key to their success. I thought I should mention that since it was good stuff, but didn't make the cut.
