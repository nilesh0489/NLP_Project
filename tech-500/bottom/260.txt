Description: Slide : -http://www.sourceconference.com/publications/bos12pubs/Hofmann%20-%20source_border_search_slides.pdfA series of unfortunate court decisions allows border agents to search travelers' laptops, mobile phones, and other digital devices without limitation at the United States border. These searches are relatively rare, but they could become more routine as sophisticated computer forensics becomes cheaper. How can international travelers protect themselves when they enter the United States? Seth Schoen and Marcia Hofmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation will will provide a clear, up-to-date, and thorough overview of this issue for all travelers to the U.S. as published in their recent white paper, "Defending Privacy at the U.S. Border: A Guide for Travelers Carrying Digital Devices." This presentation combines legal and technical perspectives, discussing the legal situation international travelers face when entering or leaving the United States, as well as various ways travelers can safeguard electronic devices and digital information at the border.Marcia Hofmann is a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where she works on a broad range of digital civil liberties issues including computer security, electronic privacy, and free expression. Seth Schoen is a Senior Staff Technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where he helps other technologists understand the civil liberties implications of their work, EFF staff better understand the technology related to EFF's work, and the public understand what technology really does.
