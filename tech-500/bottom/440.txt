SALT LAKE CITY — Mounted on the side of a pair of sunglasses is what Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank says is the future of police work.

The body cameras work like dash cameras already in police cars — they they'll provide an eye-level view of an officers one on one interaction with the public. Burbank says the body cameras are the "wave of the future" when it comes to police work and transparency.

"What better way to document the entire event then an officer wear a camera that sees what the officer sees?" Burbank said.

If Chief Burbank gets his way, these tiny, weightless cameras will soon be on every police officer in the state.

"If Salt Lake City goes this direction, if any agency goes this direction, the expectation is going to be in my mind, that everyone move in this direction," Burbank said.
