What I really wanted to see Was him crushing that bottle at the end.Disappoint.Reply

Yeah, definately needed a Doctor No moment. If I was missing a hand I think I'd go for a Han style accessory range from Enter the Dragon.Reply

I was right about you. There is a point you will not go beyond...Reply

Errrrr do you need it anymore? A quick aplicatioon of selotape you've got yourself the ultimatle life-like fisting dildo.Don't even get me started on what you can do with the soggy end...Reply

This is genuine "Awesome Future Shit". Glad for the guy, and geeking out over the tech!Reply

Very good stuff but whenever i see a prosthetic hand 'Enter The Dragon' always springs to mind...and 'Inner space' with the hairdryer and vibrator attachments.Reply

Hand Solo That really is astonishingReply

David Sarif sprang instantly to mind with the stylish black finish. Certainly a much fancier piece than Abu Hamza or Tee Hee Johnson.Reply

the bit when he grabbed the beer bottle made me lol for some reasonReply

he missed a trick here. should've opened with "NOW LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY"Reply
