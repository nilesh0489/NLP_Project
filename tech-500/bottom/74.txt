The world's first high speed amphibious vehicle will go on sale next month, according to its creators.

The vehicle - called the Quadski - can travel at speeds of up to 45mph on water or land.

To go in the water, the driver presses a button and its wheels retract in five seconds flat.

The vehicle will go on sale in the US next month and is expected to cost around ?25,000.

Alan Gibbs, founder of Michigan-based Gibbs Sports Amphibians, says they have spent 16 years and ?125 million on the project.

"Although initially the Quadski will only be for sale in America, we expect to find a ready market for it across the world in 2014," he said.
