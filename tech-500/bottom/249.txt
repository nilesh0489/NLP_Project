It’s not exactly surprising, but Microsoft (MSFT) chairman Bill Gates is a big fan of his company’s first tablet. During an in-house interview posted on Monday, Gates said that the Surface is an “unbelievably great product” that delivers “an even better tablet… that also has what you’d expect in a PC.” Gates said that he just got his first Surface RT device recently and praised the device for “the richness of the swiping” that “takes the touch interface to a whole new level.” Gates also said that he loves showing the Surface off to people, especially the click-in keyboard that folds into the tablet and makes it more of a highly-portable computer than a plain old tablet. A full video of Gates’s interview is posted below.
