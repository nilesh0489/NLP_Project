Samsung is said to be preparing a reveal for a new brand image at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, so says a a report from Australia's Channel News.

The South Korean conglomerate is apparently planning to unveil a "complete new look" that will compete with Apple's "vibrant" international brand image. The report suggests that Samsung has obtained the help of a design team that has previously worked with Nike on branding.

Scott Bedbury, a freelance brand consultant who has worked with Starbucks, is said to be overseeing the project. He's also a member of the Board of Directors for Jones Soda and the CEO of Brandstream.

"Even the advertising will change with products linked to lifestyle activities similar to what Nike does," said a Channel News source.

After making former Creative Chief Choi Gee Sung its CEO last year, Samsung is said to have shifted focus from its brand being seen as an Asian one to a global technology brand.

"For design to have a major impact, it's got to get involved at the strategic level," said David Hill, vice president of design at Lenovo. "It can't be an afterthought or superficial trappings to be put on post product creation. Samsung's brand became powerful only after they put a Chief Design Officer in place and made it a priority for the company. Now they are moving to expand the brand globally".
