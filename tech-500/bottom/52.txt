I was driving to work when the sirens started. This is how Israel’s Road No 1, aka “Jerusalem - Tel Aviv Road” looked when everyone stepped out of their cars to take shelter:

This is me, taking shelter behind my car (give me a break, the sun was in my eyes):

And then I saw two amazing Iron Dome rockets fly up from right next to me, intercepting two rockets on their way to Tel Aviv. Advanced tech to the rescue!

Then I proceeded to work, just another day in an Israeli start-up. Fucking war.
