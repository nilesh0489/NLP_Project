The firm expects that, even with high-speed LTE networks launching and expanding across the world, wireless networks will still face congestion problems as mobile device use increases — particularly on tablets.

“In order to be effective, traffic and congestion management practices for newly- launched LTE networks must be implemented at day zero to maximize subscriber quality of experience (QoE) and ensure a great, high-speed experience for all subscribers,” the report said.

Looking ahead, Sandvine predicted that real-time entertainment will be one of the biggest areas of growth when it comes to data consumption — and that the 2014 World Cup will be the “most streamed event in Internet history.”
