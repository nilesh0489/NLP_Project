Our first idea was to build a single layer tunnel plug out of the strongest fabric we could find, but we found that tears would propagate the fabric, causing it to fail. So we went back to the drawing board, and the current design has a three-layer construction. The outer layer is made from Vectran fabric; it looks like a basket or woven tablecloth, a webbing design for additional strength. The two additional layers inside are a second layer of unwoven Vectran and a flatter, inner layer that holds the water or air used to inflate the plug. Letting the plug fall into place is also a very important part of the design. If you fold this thing up compactly and then deploy it, it probably won?t go into tunnel the right way and there will be gaps. The packaging is very important, so our project team is coming up with different ways to fold it and put zip ties in place (like a fishing rag) so when a certain pressure is reached, the zip ties pop and different portions of the bag will inflate. This makes for a staged inflation and ensures that you fill the entire tunnel.Credit: E.M. Sosa from West Virginia University
