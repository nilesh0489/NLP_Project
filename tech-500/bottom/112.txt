Yesterday the Korea Times claimed that Samsung was planning to stop selling LCD panels to Apple next year, saying that the hefty discounts requested by Cupertino for its bulk purchases made the transactions unprofitable. Now Samsung has responded by telling CNET that the report was completely false, and that "Samsung Display has never tried to cut the supply for LCD panels to Apple."

While the Korea Times cited an anonymous Samsung official as its source — fairly common practice for reports out of the country — for now it seems the official word is that the company still counts Apple as a customer. Samsung supplies the Retina display in the current iPad, but the rumored iPad mini is said to use panels from LG and AU Optronics.
