The BBC and Deutschlandradio have joined forces to support the rollout of a single, universal chip to enable radios to receive multiple broadcasting standards across Europe.

The move aims to tackle uncertainty in the market and create a 'future proof' design with enough volume to bring costs down dramatically. The 'Euro-Chip' is an existing set of minimum features and functions, originally created by WorldDMB, for all new digital radio receivers. It ensures the interoperability of all new digital radio receivers in European countries where broadcasters are using DAB, DAB+ or DMB, and/or analogue AM and FM. "Digital radio across Europe has been plagued by uncertainty," said Tim Davie, Director of Audio and Music at the BBC. "We may be reaching a tipping point, but first we have to bank what is certain about radio's digital hybrid future and join forces to promote a common vision across Europe." "Digital radio is a technology invented in Europe and we as broadcasters in Europe can show that we are able to work together to assure the future of radio," said Willi Steu, Director-General of Deutschlandradio (left) "This is of critical importance for broadcasters, manufacturers and the public," said Nyberg Frankenhaeuser, Media Director of the European Broadcasting Union. "We must ensure that European consumers are able to buy future-proofed receivers that will provide them with radio services across Europe." Chip makers for DAB and DMB include Frontier Silicon (now part of Toumaz Technologies) using designs from Imagination Technologies, and Panasonic. www.ebu.ch
