The 2012 Maker Faire Africa held in Lagos, Nigeria this week brought together people who build things, from traditional crafts to modern inventions. Four teenage girls made a particularly lasting impression at the event with their generator that is powered by urine.

Amazingly, the generator, built by Duro-Aina Adebola (14 years of age), Akindele Abiola (14), Faleke Oluwatoyin (14) and Bello Eniola (15), needs only about a quart of urine to provide up to six hours of electricity.

It works by adding urine to an electrolytic cell to separate the hydrogen. The hydrogen moves into a water purification filter and is then pushed into a gas cylinder. This forces the hydrogen into a cylinder of liquid borax, removing the moisture from the gas and from there, it is pushed into the generator. Voila! Pee-powered energy.
