As if we don’t have enough annoying distractions vying for our attention these days, Facebook (FB) is apparently testing out a beeping notification sound that rings out every time someone likes your status or comments on a post. VentureBeat’s Sean Ludwig was one of the unlucky duckies who got to try out this new feature early and he already says it’s driving him up the wall. In particular, Ludwig says that the sound effects have made it “a gamble” to leave his Facebook page “open in a tab.” Since this is clearly not the sort of thing that Facebook wants its users to feel, it’s unlikely that these notification sounds will become a permanent fixture. And even if they are, Ludwig says that they’re very easy to shut off by adjusting user settings. A short video of the new notification sounds is posted below.
