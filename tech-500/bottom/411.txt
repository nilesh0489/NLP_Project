At Maker Faire Africa in Lagos, a group of teenage girls have created a generator that lets you put your waste to good use. The four Nigerian teens, aged just 14 and 15 years old, are Duro-Aina Adebola, Akindele Abiola, Faleke Oluwatoyin, and Bello Eniola. They made a urine powered generator that can provide six hours of electricity with one liter of urine.

Urine is put into an electrolytic cell to separate out the hydrogen, which then goes into a water filter for purification. It is then pushed through a gas cylinder into a cylinder of liquid borax, which removes moisture from the hydrogen gas to purify it further. Finally, the gas is pushed into the generator and used to create electricity. The device is currently quite explosive, although it does have one-way valves along it for security and holds promise for turning human waste into something very useful.
