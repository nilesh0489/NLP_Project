While people who just got into Congressional issues during the SOPA fight may have thought that Rep. Lamar Smith was Hollywood's favorite representative, that honor much more likely fell on Rep. Howard Berman -- who, for many years was Hollywood's guy in Congress (somewhat literally, as parts of Hollywood were covered by his district). There was, of course, no chance that Lamar Smith was going to lose his re-election campaign, as there were no serious challengers, but Berman was definitely a different story. Due to redistricting, his district was merged with another longterm Congressional Rep., Brad Sherman -- and the two had to face off. It turns out that Berman lost and Sherman won. Sherman, not surprisingly, also tends to support the entertainment industry's position on a lot of things, but never quite to the level of Berman over the years. Another longterm favorite of the entertainment industry, Rep. Mary Bono Mack, who ushered in the ridiculous Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension and has been a regular supporter of the entertainment industry's crazier plans, has lost out in a very tight race. As for Smith, he won his election to no one's surprise -- but the margin was actually a lot lower than I expected. He took it with 60% of the vote. In 2008 he had 80% of the vote and in 2010, 69% of the vote. It may not have been enough to tip the election, but perhaps young people in his district voted for internet freedom.
