How much time do you spend on the web each day? If you live in North America, a new report says, probably a lot.

Canadian company Sandvine, in their Global Internet Phenomena Report, confirmed that online data usage in North America has increased by 120% over the past year. Netflix makes up 33% of the traffic — a definite boost for the company since last year’s price hike angered many of its viewers.

Amazon makes up 1.8% of downstream traffic, the report says, with Hulu at 1.4% and HBO GO at 0.5%. In total, all audio and video streaming services account for 65% of traffic between 9:00 p.m. and midnight.

File sharing network BitTorrent takes up 16% of traffic — but, Sandvine predicts, real-time entertainment’s rising popularity will size it down to 10% overall by 2015.
