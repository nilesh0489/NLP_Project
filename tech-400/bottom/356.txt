The size and weight of electric car batteries have long posed a problem for the feasibility of such automobiles, as they cause drag and distance issues.

But some scientists are moving towards turning the car’s frame into one large battery. The plan, called the “Storage Project,” would replace steel in the frame with materials that could store energy, reported Reuters.

The ingenious solution is not only creative, but inexpensive.

“The beauty of this is that we can employ commercially available carbon fibers. Some of these carbon fibers have this multifunctional capability without anybody looking for it beforehand,” said the head of one research institute.
