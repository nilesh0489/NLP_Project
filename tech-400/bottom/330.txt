Ever wish you could feed your pet from afar? Meet Pintofeed, a device that lets you feed your pet using your smartphone.

Once connected to the wireless network in your home, you can activate the feeder from anywhere using a mobile app. Feedings can also be automated. The Pintofeed is capable of programming itself, and creating a personalized feeding schedule for you and your furry friend.

If you have more than one furball at home, you can control several Pintofeeds from the same account. Multiple users can also be given access to the same Pintofeeds, ensuring that Fido gets fed even if Mom is out of town.

Once your pet has been fed, you can choose to be notified via SMS, Twitter or even Facebook.

Pintofeed has a 5- and 10-pound food repository for storing meals and keeping food fresh. Food can be dispensed in half-cup portions, allowing you to keep track of exactly how much food your pet is consuming and to help combat overeating.
