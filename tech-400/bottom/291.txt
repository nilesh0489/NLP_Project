The iPad mini may be small, but the demand for the device has people doing crazy things, just like other Apple devices. It just took two guys with a truck to easily steal 3,600 iPad minis that had just arrived at JFK Airport. There are 3,600 Apple customers who are very disappointed right now. It looks like these two theives managed to load two pallets before an airport worker returned from dinner and started staring at them in a disapproving manner. I wonder how many more they might have made away with. The iPads have been estimated to cost about $1.5 million.

People will do some very stupid things when it comes to Apple products.
