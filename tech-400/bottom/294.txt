Mozilla‘s vision of the Internet is a place where anyone can access information, a place where everyone can hack and tinker; one that has openness, freedom and transparency; where users have control over their personal data and where all minds have the freedom to create and to consume without walls or tight restrictions.

In less than 20 years the Internet has changed our lives. It is a powerful platform with unprecedented opportunity and connectedness. But even with great growth and innovation there are significant challenges to this vision of a healthy Internet.

Mozilla is mobilized to ensure the protection of the Web and to empower tomorrow’s webmakers and Web users. Today, Mozilla is growing — with more employees, contributors, products and locations — to ensure that the Web remains an open, vibrant ecosystem. Because, the Web is the platform for building the world we want.
