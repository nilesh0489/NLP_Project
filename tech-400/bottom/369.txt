Bronstein Music was founded by husband and wife, Milton and Celia Bronstein. Milton Bronstein, a trumpet player, led the 6th Army Band during World War II and later taught music in Oroville, California. Milton and Celia started Bronstein Music in 1946, shortly after the war. For years they sold everything from musical instruments, sheet music, records, record players and even hair dryers and refrigerators! In 1981, the Bronsteins retired and sold the business to Don Edwards and Rich Welker, two employees who had been working at the store since they were high school students in 1968. Today, Bronstein Music is the best San Francisco musical instrument store, and is a respected name, not only in California, but also around the world. We are continually changing and adapting to meet the needs of our customers. We specialize in musical instruments, music lessons, instrument repair, and more.
