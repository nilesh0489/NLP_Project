Researchers at Stanford University have created a synthetic material that’s capable of healing itself after it’s been punctured.

The material is a polymer plastic mixed with pieces of nickel. It’s comprised of long chains of molecules connected by hydrogen bonds; the connection is relatively weak, so it allows the molecules to easily break apart (say, when the material is sliced with a scalpel). The conductivity from the metal then helps the bonds rearrange themselves and, because of their flexibility, restore the original structure within 30 minutes.

Zhenan Bao, a chemical engineering professor at Stanford, said in a statement that both ingredients create the “best of both worlds” — the flexibility of polymer and the conductivity of metal — that allow it to closely resemble the qualities of human skin.

Researchers are hoping the material can be used for future prosthetic limbs and electrical wiring. Watch the video above to learn more.
