"These new materials have outstanding commercial potential because they can address a void in multi-billion dollar markets, allowing for the advancement of new and emerging technologies such as printable electronics, thin-film-transistors, optoelectronic devices, and new types of environmentally-friendly light sources." said Graphene Laboratories CEO Dr. Elena Polyakova. She continued, "The materials readily can be produced in large volumes, and our team is ready to scale-up our production to satisfy customer demand."

Graphene - the material which won Manchester University scientists the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics - has made waves in the scientific community for its outstanding properties. Since then, however, its intrinsic limitations have been realized, including its lack of a band-gap. These challenges have led scientists to become increasingly interested in other 2-dimensional materials.

MoS2, WS2, and BN have many remarkable properties of their own, outperforming graphene in a variety of ways. These materials have a direct band-gap, and if being used for electronic applications exhibit a high current ON/OFF ratio. In addition, the direct band-gap is the reason for their high level of photoluminescence, giving them applications in optoelectronic devices.

Commenting on the expanded product line, Chief Technology Officer Dr. Daniel Stolyarov said "Our team has been working with graphene materials for about five years now. We have been amazed at the properties of graphene, and are equally excited about these new novel 2D graphene-like materials. Though not a replacement to graphene, these new members of the family of 2D materials have properties which are complimentary to it. Together with graphene, these 2D materials form a toolkit to be employed in many emerging technologies."
