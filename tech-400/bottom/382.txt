Kim Dotcom will not be denied. After facing a minor setback last week when the Gabonese government shut down its original domain name, Kim Dotcom’s new Mega website came back online this week and still looks primed for its grand launch on January 19th. Dotcom on Monday sent out a notice through Twitter that “New Zealand will be the home of our new website: http://Mega.co.nz,” which would be ”powered by legality and protected by the law.” Going to the website shows a giant red “MEGA” icon that promises to “change the world” on January 19th.
