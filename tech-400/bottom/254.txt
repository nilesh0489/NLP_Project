MIXING 3d printing with real world objects – a sandstone block built from lego, blending real objects with 3d printing. Greg Petchkovsky does the work with Lego. But what else could this technology be used for?

Alfio has an amputed leg. He wonders if the technology could help him.

Every morning before putting on the sleeve and the prosthesis, I have a dressing bandages and cotton to absorb the bumps and shape the stump with the convex tip. This is very annoying… I tried to make the molds by dipping the residual limb in bowl of silicone. It’s not good.. Do you think that this process is applicable in my case?

This technology could indeed help, to get a good quality scan from a smooth surface like human skin it can help to apply a fine grain blotchy random pattern using facepaint, this gives the software features to lock onto, making the scan more accurate. However, I’d also highly recommend that you look into other molding materials, especially alginate. Alginate sets very fast (usually around 3 to 6 minutes) and is extremely soft. There are also some types of silicone that are specifically made for lifecasting and will set very quickly, though they may be more expensive than alginate.

If plastic objects can be so easily replicated, your carer as a celebrity look-alike might be dead.
