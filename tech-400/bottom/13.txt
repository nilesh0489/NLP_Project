There may be an app for almost everything, but there still isn’t one for controlling Mother Nature.

Google this morning officially canceled the Android event that was scheduled to occur on Monday, October 29 in New York City due to Hurricane Sandy, which is expected to hit the city on Sunday evening.

In an email sent to reporters signed up to attend the event first picked up by Marketing Land’s Danny Sullivan, Google issued a terse explanation:

“We are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more.”

We’ve reached out to Google PR for more detail on when the event may be rescheduled, and will be sure to update this with anything we hear.

The Android event was expected to compete for press attention with Microsoft’s Windows Phone 8 launch also planned for Monday October 29th. That event is still on, though, as it’s taking place in sunny San Francisco.
