Dany Qumsiyeh of has come up with an automatic book-scanning device that could make digitizing physical books more cost efficient and less time-consuming. is a prototype page-turning scanner that moves a book face-down over linear sensors to capture high-resolution images of each page, and uses vacuum pressure to automatically turn pages as the book moves. ordinary vacuum cleaner, the US$1,500 machine is quick to setup and can digitize a 1,000-page book in about 90 minutes or so (depending on the speed of the motor used). scanning methods, the Linear Book Scanner doesn’t require someone to operate it once it’s been set in motion. made the project available for anyone who’d like to create his or her own automatic book scanner. on building your own Linear Book Scanner, you can go: here [via Google Project Hosting
