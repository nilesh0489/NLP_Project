I've seen the space shuttle in every possible way and angle. Even at the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. But I've never seen it completely shrink-wrapped, as if someone just ordered one from Amazon.

Atlantis is now at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, where it arrived at the beginning of November. Since the building is still under construction, the shuttle has been wrapped in plastic, so no dust gets onto it. Everyone is going to know what this is if they leave it under a Christmas tree.
