To help save you time setting up your profile (and give you more of the things you love), we can pull your interests (like movies, music, and celebs) and public profile info (name, email, gender, birth date, and photo) from Facebook and automatically add and follow them on your Myspace profile. Don't worry, you'll be able to edit it later!
