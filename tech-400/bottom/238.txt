Torrent tracker The Pirate Bay has been under a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack overnight, with the site ceasing to serve requests from users.

The outage was confirmed on Twitter by one of The Pirate Bay's accounts, and is believed to have been orchestrated by a user called Zeiko.


Zeiko claimed to have launched two DDoS attacks overnight, and the second one succeeded in knocking The Pirate Bay offline.

The attacker also hit Fenopy, another torrent tracker, and claims to have succeded in taking that site down too.

However, Fenopy remains accessible as of writing and The Pirate Bay has also resumed service.

Speaking to file sharing news site Torrent Freak, The Pirate Bay said it wasn't too concerned about the attack and said it would use the downtime to perform database upgrades.

According to The Pirate Bay, the DDoS was a SYN flood through a small botnet of compromised machines, in which the attacker abuses the TCP three-way handshake to establish multiple empty connections so that a server eventually runs out of resources.

Last month, The Pirate Bay announced that it had switched over to cloud-based hosting with a virtualised architecture, in part to make the site harder for authorities to take down.
