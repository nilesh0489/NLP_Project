Google this week launched its Voter Information Tool, an online resource for information on this year's presidential election. On the site, users can locate their nearest polling place, as well as nearby early vote venues. The tool also includes information on voting rules and requirements, in addition to basic details on each presidential candidate, with links to their respective social media sites. The tool is essentially a revamped version of the US Voter Info site Google launched ahead of the 2008 presidential election, and, like its predecessor, is open source and easily embeddable.
