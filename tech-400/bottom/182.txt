A supercomputer at the government's Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee has been named the fastest in the world.

Titan, a Cray XK7 system occupying 200 cabinets, reached a speed of 17.59 petaflops -- 17.59 quadrillion calculations per second. The latest semiannual Top500 global ranking was announced Monday at a supercomputing conference in Salt Lake City.

Titan zipped past the previous winner, named Sequoia, at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, east of San Francisco, which regained the U.S. title from China in the previous 2012 rankings. In the latest list, U.S. supercomputers hold three of the top five positions and five of the top 10.

Titan last month replaced the Energy Department lab's XT5 Jaguar, which was ranked the fastest computer in November 2009 and June 2010. It was used to develop models for climate change.

"It's not practical or affordable to continue increasing supercomputing capacity with traditional CPU-only architecture," said Jeff Nichols, the associate director for computing and computational sciences at the Oak Ridge lab. "Combining GPUs and CPUs is a responsible move toward lowering our carbon footprint, and Titan will enable scientific leadership by providing unprecedented computing power for research in energy, climate change, materials, and other disciplines."
