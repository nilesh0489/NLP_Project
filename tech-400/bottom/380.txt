A teenaged hacker known as Cosmo the God, who was involved in a number of big site takedowns earlier this year, and who is considered a "social engineering mastermind" has been sentenced to probation. The terms include a ban on internet access until his 21st birthday, six years from now, according to a Wired article by Mat Honan. For many years, we've questioned whether or not it's reasonable (or even practical) to ban people from the internet for computer related crimes. It seems not only stupid and counterproductive, but just plain bizarre. The internet is so integrated into our lives these days that taking the internet out of your life is a lot more complicated than some might imagine. Can you still use a voice over IP phone system to make a phone call? What about using an internet-connected kiosk at a store to order something? The terms here seem particularly broad and overreaching -- the kind of requirements that people who don't really live on the internet would think are reasonable without realizing what they're doing to him:

Since this is a plea bargain, it sounds like he's accepted those terms, but it seems fairly crazy. Honan talks with an attorney who finds the situation ridiculous: Furthermore, we've seen numerous such internet bans tossed out for being rights violations . Sure, the guy broke the law, and should be punished for that. But banning him from the internet for six years seems to go way beyond what's reasonable.
