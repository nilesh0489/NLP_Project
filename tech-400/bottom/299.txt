The founder of the anti-virus software firm McAfee is wanted for questioning by police in Belize over the murder of his neighbour. He is described as a 'person of interest' rather than an 'suspect'.

However, journalist Joshua Davis said he had been receiving calls from John McAfee at 'all hours of the day and night' as he attempted to evade police over fears of 'not getting a fair trial'.

Mr Davis said the multi-millionaire told him he had changed his appearance and hid in the sand with a cardboard box over his head when the police came to question him.
