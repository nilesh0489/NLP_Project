Computer security industry pioneer John McAfee says he has gone into hiding in Belize because he believes authorities there are trying to frame him for the murder of a neighbour, a crime he says he did not commit, according to Wired magazine.

Belize police are searching for Mr McAfee as "a person of interest" in a murder investigation.

"You can say I'm paranoid about it, but they will kill me, there is no question. They've been trying to get me for months. They want to silence me," Wired quoted Mr McAfee as saying on its website.

"I am not well liked by the prime minister. I am just a thorn in everybody's side."

The magazine reported Mr McAfee, 67, contacted one of its reporters by telephone after his neighbour, Gregory Faull, was found dead on Sunday in a pool of blood.

The 52-year-old American was apparently shot in the head.

Police say Mr McAfee had a history of conflict with Mr Faull, whose post-mortem was expected to be conducted on Tuesday (local time).

Mr McAfee, who amassed a fortune by building the anti-virus company that bears his name, has homes and businesses in the Central American country where police say he has lived for at least two years.

It is not the first time Mr McAfee, who has a penchant for guns, has drawn police attention.

His premises were raided earlier this year after he was accused of holding firearms, though most were found to be licensed. The final outcome of the case is pending.

He was also suspected of running a lab to make the synthetic drug crystal meth.

"He was suspected (of making crystal meth) but he was not convicted nor was he charged. He was only suspected," Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said.

Mr McAfee also owns a security company in Belize as well as several properties and an ecological enterprise.

Reuters has been unable to reach Mr McAfee.

"It would be quite nice for him to come in and answer some of the questions that could lead to the closure of this case," Mr Martinez said.

"He is not wanted for murder, but he is wanted for questioning as a person of interest."

The Belize police department has reached out to counterparts in neighbouring Mexico and Guatemala, asking them to detain Mr McAfee if he leaves Belize overland.

Mr McAfee was one of Silicon Valley's first entrepreneurs to amass a fortune by building a business off the internet.

The former Lockheed systems consultant started McAfee Associates in 1989, initially distributing anti-virus software as "shareware" on internet bulletin boards.

He took the company public in 1992 and left two years later following accusations he had hyped the arrival of a virus known as Michelangelo, which turned out to be a dud, to scare computer users into buying his company's products.

Mr McAfee currently has no relationship with the software company, which has since been sold to Intel Corp.
