The Google Nexus 4 smartphone website indicated that the unit was sold out in the US Google Play store in both 8GB and 16GB variants, but some users are reporting that they have been able to purchase it. Roughly 50 minutes after it went on sale at 8:35 this morning, the site was displaying the ‘coming soon’ banner for us.

Update: Google has confirmed that it has sold out in ‘a few countries’.

The Nexus 4 went on sale in Europe earlier today and sold out there as well, along with the Nexus 10. The Nexus 4 sold out in roughly 15 minutes in Germany.

A sellout is good for Google obviously, but the question of how much stock there actually was in the store limits our ability to assign a rating of just how good it is. I quite liked the Nexus 4 when I reviewed it earlier in the month. It has the best Google Now experience on Android so far and shows some promise for the platform. But is crippled in some regions by its lack of LTE (which won’t affect some global purchasers obviously).

Update: Some readers, like Henk van Ess are reporting that they’re still able to snag them. He used Chrome to make his purchase as other browsers wouldn’t allow him to complete the transaction.

We’ve amended the post above to indicate that you can probably keep trying at this point.
