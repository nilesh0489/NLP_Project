So to get a couple things out of the way;

We are representing the Tribeforth Foundation, and our main goal is the ethical development of collective intelligence in society. We are also building a platform, named "Openthinklab" which we are designing to support the mass communication and collaboration of our global society in order to confront and start solving the many issues we are facing as a society. We are all part of a global society, it's time we had an organisational structure to support it.

This is an AMA and we've been asked a few questions already which i'll post below, any and all questions and feedback is appreciated!
