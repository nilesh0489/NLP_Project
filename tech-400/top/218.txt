Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (005930) may never settle their patent disputes, but those who have argued that Apple is completely unwilling to negotiate in its various patent battles with Android vendors have some backtracking to do. Apple and struggling Taiwan-based smartphone maker HTC (2498) jointly announced on Saturday that they have reached an agreement that settles all open patent complaints. Moreover, the companies confirmed that they have entered into a 10-year patent licensing deal that covers all current, pending and future patents and will prevent future entanglements in court, at least for the next decade.

“We are glad to have reached a settlement with HTC,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “We will continue to stay laser focused on product innovation.” HTC’s chief executive Peter Chou added, ”HTC is pleased to have resolved its dispute with Apple, so HTC can focus on innovation instead of litigation.”

HTC also told reporters that the deal is not expected to have a negative impact on HTC’s financials moving forward, which will surely come as a relief to investors considering the company’s current struggles.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
