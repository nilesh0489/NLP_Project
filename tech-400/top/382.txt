Portland-based ebook publisher Publerati recently expanded its distribution through the international nonprofit Worldreader to bring digital books to children and teachers in parts of Africa.

Company founder and Publisher Caleb Mason said in a press release that the agreement will make fiction from Publerati's authors in India, the United States and England available to Worldreader's programs in sub-Sahara Africa and on a Worldreader application for mobile phones.

In a blog post about the agreement, Mason writes that it works on a museum model where a minimum of 5% of the proceeds from the ebook sales will fund free ebook distribution through the Worldreader program.
