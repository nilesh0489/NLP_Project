Asus customers who forked out for a Nexus 7 before the price drop on 29 October have been offered a £25 gift voucher in consolation.

The coupon is limited to those who bought their device directly from Asus , and not only must the slate be registered with Asus, but customers will have to provide proof of purchase too.

Nexus 7 owners who bought their tablet before 29 October have until the end of the month to register. And the £25 voucher must be used before the turn of the year. But at least folk annoyed to have missed October's repricing announcements can now grab themselves a free Nexus 7 case or some such from the Asus store.

Check out the Asus Nexus 7 website for further details.
