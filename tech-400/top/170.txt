Shin Jong-kyun, Samsung’s head of mobile and IT, told Yonhap News that the company has no intention to negotiate with Apple to reach a settlement like HTC did recently.

“It may be true that HTC may have agreed to pay 300 billion won (US$276 million) to Apple, but we don’t intend to (negotiate) at all,” Shin told reporters, according to the publication.

The Samsung executive’s statement comes on the heels of a surprise announcement over the weekend that Apple and HTC had settled their global patent battle with a 10-year licensing agreement. One analyst has since reported hearing from industry sources that HTC agreed to pay Apple a licensing fee of $6-$8 for every Android phone it sells.

Apple has been engaged in patent fights around the world with multiple Android smartphone manufacturers, including HTC and Samsung, ever since 2010. This legal battle is part of the “thermonuclear war” that Apple’s former CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs vowed to wage against Google’s Android operating system and its manufacturing partners for allegedly ripping off the iPhone.

News of the patent settlement between HTC and Apple raised the prospect that Apple might be able to come to similar settlements with other companies, most notably Samsung. However, Samsung is in a much stronger position than HTC both because it has a much greater share of the smartphone market and because it has won several decisions against Apple already.
