Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer is expecting 2013 to be one of the company's busiest years, but he's not yet ready to start talking about Windows 8 and Surface sales.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ballmer said that in terms of Windows 8 and Surface sales for the first few days, "there's not really much that's interesting to report."On any ordinary day, that probably would've plunged stock price by a good few percent. So, whether or not Ballmer is playing his cards close to his chest, preparing for some big reveal later, or sales haven't been all that interesting, it remains to be seen.Ballmer went on to say: "If you were to call the retailers, they would say, 'Hey, off to a very good start'." and that, "we're out of stock [in] a lot of places on touch-[screen] machines".Reading between the lines, and putting this together with what I've been hearing from the supply chain and the OEMs, I think that Microsoft has decided to play to safe with Surface and keep the initial order modest. It's better to sell out of tablets, and keep the customers wanting more, than it is to end up will millions gathering dust and have to have a frantic fire sale down the line -- such as the one that HP ended up having with the TouchPad.As for Windows 8, I have to say that this is the most subdued Windows launch that I can recall. The buzz doesn't seem to be there, and instead it's been replaced by confusion over pricing, hardware requirements, and the whole issue of touch. There also seems to be a great deal of confusion over the differences between Windows 8 and Windows RT, specifically nobody quite knows what the latter is even for.This much consumer confusion at the point of release seems to suggest that the industry -- specifically Microsoft and its hardware partners -- have not done a good enough job of educating the masses about Windows 8.We'll have to wait until Microsoft unveils financial details for this quarter to see if this had a negative effect on sales.

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) won renewal of critical exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in a ruling published today, including the upholding of jailbreaking rights for smartphones as well as new and expanded legal protections for video remixing."The DMCA creates a cloud of legal uncertainty over American consumers â€“ whether they are tinkerers, artists, or just looking to make their gadgets work better," said EFF Intellectual Property Director Corynne McSherry. "The ruling from the Copyright Office today goes a long way towards mitigating some of the DMCA's most grievous harms."Crucial support for the successful request on behalf of video remix artists â€“ carving out new legal protection for this important art form â€“ was provided by the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW). The OTW gathered evidence and presented testimony about the DMCA's adverse impact on several communities of remix creators, who use short clips from movies to build new creative works. The Copyright Office's decision broadens EFF's previously successful exemption request, which allows for taking short excerpts from DVDs in creating noncommercial works, by also protecting the use of clips from online streaming or downloading services."Remix videos are thriving on YouTube and other sites, offering dynamic criticism and commentary on popular movies as well as popular culture. It's a great example of how new technologies foster free expression, yet the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA endanger these important works," said McSherry. "We're thrilled that the Copyright Office broke new ground in protecting remix artists. We can't let misguided federal law block a new form of art and expression."The Copyright Office also renewed EFF's exemption request that protects smartphone jailbreaking, liberating phone owners to run operating systems and applications from any source, not just those approved by the manufacturer. However, the Copyright Office declined to expand that exemption to tablets and video game consoles, arguing that the category of "tablets" is not well defined and that jailbreaking video game consoles might lead to more copyright infringement."If you bought your gadget, you own it, and you should be able to install whatever software you please without facing potential legal threats," said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann. "We're pleased the Copyright Office renewed our smartphone jailbreaking exemption request, but we're disappointed that it couldn't see that consumers deserve the same rights for all the gadgets they own. We'll be back with more exemption requests in the next rulemaking, and we're hopeful the Copyright Office will keep moving in the right direction."The Copyright Office's rulemaking process is conducted every three years in order to mitigate the danger the DMCA poses to legitimate, non-infringing uses of copyrighted materials. The DMCA prohibits "circumventing" digital rights management (DRM) and "other technical protection measures" used to control access to copyrighted works. While the DMCA still chills competition, free speech, and fair use, today's exemptions help give consumers and artists protection from the law's extensive reach.EFF would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of the Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, in drafting the jailbreaking exemption requests.For the full ruling from the copyright office:https://www.eff.org/node/72131For more on our exemption requests:https://www.eff.org/cases/2012-dmca-rulemaking

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the world's first operational packet switching network and the progenitor of what was to become the global Internet. The network was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) within the U.S. Department of Defense for use by its projects at universities and research laboratories in the US. The packet switching of the ARPANET was based on designs by British scientist Donald Davies and Lawrence Roberts of the Lincoln Laboratory.Packet switching, today the dominant basis for data communications worldwide, was a new concept at the time of the conception of the ARPANET. Prior to the advent of packet switching, both voice and data communications had been based on the idea of circuit switching, as in the traditional telephone circuit, wherein each telephone call is allocated a dedicated, end to end, electronic connection between the two communicating stations. Such stations might be telephones or computers. The (temporarily) dedicated line is typically composed of many intermediary lines which are assembled into a chain that stretches all the way from the originating station to the destination station. With packet switching, a data system could use a single communications link to communicate with more than one machine by collecting data into datagrams and transmitting these as packets onto the attached network link, as soon as the link becomes idle. Thus, not only can the link be shared, much as a single post box can be used to post letters to different destinations, but each packet can be routed independently of other packets.The earliest ideas for a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users were formulated by computer scientist J. C. R. Licklider, of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), in August 1962, in memoranda discussing his concept for an "Intergalactic Computer Network". Those ideas contained almost everything that composes the contemporary Internet. In October 1963, Licklider was appointed head of the Behavioral Sciences and Command and Control programs at the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency â€” ARPA (the initial ARPANET acronym). He then convinced Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor that this computer network concept was very important and merited development, although Licklider left ARPA before any contracts were let that worked on this concept.Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor continued their interest in creating such a computer communications network, in part, to allow ARPA-sponsored researchers at various corporate and academic locales to put to use the computers ARPA was providing them, and, in part, to make new software and other computer science results quickly and widely available. In his office, Taylor had three computer terminals, each connected to separate computers, which ARPA was funding: the first, for the System Development Corporation (SDC) Q-32, in Santa Monica; the second, for Project Genie, at the University of California, Berkeley; and the third, for Multics, at MIT. Taylor recalls the circumstance: "For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets of user commands. So, if I was talking online with someone at S.D.C., and I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley, or M.I.T., about this, I had to get up from the S.D.C. terminal, go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. I said, "Oh Man!", it's obvious what to do: If you have these three terminals, there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. That idea is the ARPANET". Somewhat contemporaneously, several other people had (mostly independently) worked out the aspects of "packet switching", with the first public demonstration presented by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), on 5 August 1968, in the United Kingdom.By mid-1968, Taylor had prepared a complete plan for a computer network, and, after ARPA's approval, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) was sent to 140 potential bidders. Most computer science companies regarded the ARPAâ€“Taylor proposal as outlandish, and only twelve submitted bids to build the network; of the twelve, ARPA regarded only four as top-rank contractors. At year's end, ARPA considered only two contractors, and awarded the contract to build the network to BBN Technologies on 7 April 1969. The initial, seven-man BBN team were much aided by the technical specificity of their response to the ARPA RFQ â€“ and thus quickly produced the first working computers. This team was led by Frank Heart. The BBN-proposed network closely followed Taylor's ARPA plan: a network composed of small computers called Interface Message Processors (IMPs), that functioned as gateways (today called routers) interconnecting local resources. At each site, the IMPs performed store-and-forward packet switching functions, and were interconnected with modems that were connected to leased lines, initially running at 50kbit/second. The host computers were connected to the IMPs via custom serial communication interfaces. The system, including the hardware and the packet switching software, was designed and installed in nine months.The first-generation IMPs were initially built by BBN Technologies using a rugged computer version of the Honeywell DDP-516 computer configured with 24kB of expandable core memory, and a 16-channel Direct Multiplex Control (DMC) direct memory access unit. The DMC established custom interfaces with each of the host computers and modems. In addition to the front-panel lamps, the DDP-516 computer also features a special set of 24 indicator-lamps showing the status of the IMP communication channels. Each IMP could support up to four local hosts, and could communicate with up to six remote IMPs via leased lines.Common ARPANET lore posits that the computer network was designed to survive a nuclear attack. In A Brief History of the Internet, the Internet Society describes the coalescing of the technical ideas that produced the ARPANET:Although the ARPANET was designed to survive subordinate-network losses, the principal reason was that the switching nodes and network links were unreliable, even without any nuclear attacks. About the resource scarcity that spurred the creation of the ARPANET, Charles Herzfeld, ARPA Director (1965â€“1967), said:Packet switching pioneer Paul Baran affirms this, explaining: "Bob Taylor had a couple of computer terminals speaking to different machines, and his idea was to have some way of having a terminal speak to any of them and have a network. That's really the origin of the ARPANET. The method used to connect things together was an open issue for a time."The initial ARPANET consisted of four IMPs:The first message on the ARPANET was sent by UCLA student programmer Charley Kline, at 10:30Â pm on 29 October 1969, from Boelter Hall 3420. Kline transmitted from the university's SDS Sigma 7 Host computer to the Stanford Research Institute's SDS 940 Host computer. The message text was the word login; the l and the o letters were transmitted, but the system then crashed. Hence, the literal first message over the ARPANET was lo. About an hour later, having recovered from the crash, the SDS Sigma 7 computer effected a full login. The first permanent ARPANET link was established on 21 November 1969, between the IMP at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By 5 December 1969, the entire four-node network was established.In March 1970, the ARPANET reached the East Coast of the United States, when an IMP at BBN in Cambridge, Massachusetts was connected to the network. Thereafter, the ARPANET grew: 9 IMPs by June 1970 and 13 IMPs by December 1970, then 18 by September 1971 (when the network included 23 university and government hosts); 29 IMPs by August 1972, and 40 by September 1973. By June 1974, there were 46 IMPs, and in July 1975, the network numbered 57 IMPs. By 1981, the number was 213 host computers, with another host connecting approximately every twenty days.In 1973 a transatlantic satellite link connected the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) to the ARPANET, making Norway the first country outside the US to be connected to the network. At about the same time a terrestrial circuit added a London IMP.In 1975, the ARPANET was declared "operational". The Defense Communications Agency took control since ARPA was intended to fund advanced research.In 1983, the ARPANET was split with U.S. military sites on their own Military Network (MILNET) for unclassified defense department communications. The combination was called the Defense Data Network (DDN). Separating the civil and military networks reduced the 113-node ARPANET by 68 nodes. Gateways relayed electronic mail between the two networks. MILNET later became the NIPRNet.Because of its government ties, certain forms of traffic were discouraged or prohibited. A 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's AI Lab stated regarding network etiquette:Support for inter-IMP circuits of up to 230.4 kbit/s was added in 1970, although considerations of cost and IMP processing power meant this capability was not actively used.1971 saw the start of the use of the non-ruggedized (and therefore significantly lighter) Honeywell 316 as an IMP. It could also be configured as a Terminal Interface Processor (TIP), which provided terminal server support for up to 63 ASCII serial terminals through a multi-line controller in place of one of the hosts. The 316 featured a greater degree of integration than the 516, which made it less expensive and easier to maintain. The 316 was configured with 40 kB of core memory for a TIP. The size of core memory was later increased, to 32 kB for the IMPs, and 56 kB for TIPs, in 1973.In 1975, BBN introduced IMP software running on the Pluribus multi-processor. These appeared in a small number of sites. In 1981, BBN introduced IMP software running on its own C/30 processor product.In 1983, TCP/IP protocols replaced NCP as the ARPANET's principal protocol, and the ARPANET then became one subnet of the early Internet.The original IMPs and TIPs were phased out as the ARPANET was shut down after the introduction of the NSFNet, but some IMPs remained in service as late as 1989.The ARPANET Completion Report, jointly published by BBN and ARPA, concludes that:In the wake of ARPANET being formally decommissioned on 28 February 1990, Vinton Cerf wrote the following lamentation, entitled "Requiem of the ARPANET":Senator Albert Gore, Jr. began to craft the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (commonly referred to as "The Gore Bill") after hearing the 1988 report toward a National Research Network submitted to Congress by a group chaired by Leonard Kleinrock, professor of computer science at UCLA. The bill was passed on 9 December 1991 and led to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) which Al Gore called the "information superhighway". ARPANET was the subject of two IEEE Milestones, both dedicated in 2009.The starting point for host-to-host communication on the ARPANET in 1969 was the 1822 protocol, which defined the transmission of messages to an IMP. The message format was designed to work unambiguously with a broad range of computer architectures. An 1822 message essentially consisted of a message type, a numeric host address, and a data field. To send a data message to another host, the transmitting host formatted a data message containing the destination host's address and the data message being sent, and then transmitted the message through the 1822 hardware interface. The IMP then delivered the message to its destination address, either by delivering it to a locally connected host, or by delivering it to another IMP. When the message was ultimately delivered to the destination host, the receiving IMP would transmit a Ready for Next Message (RFNM) acknowledgement to the sending, host IMP.Unlike modern Internet datagrams, the ARPANET was designed to reliably transmit 1822 messages, and to inform the host computer when it loses a message; the contemporary IP is unreliable, whereas the TCP is reliable. Nonetheless, the 1822 protocol proved inadequate for handling multiple connections among different applications residing in a host computer. This problem was addressed with the Network Control Program (NCP), which provided a standard method to establish reliable, flow-controlled, bidirectional communications links among different processes in different host computers. The NCP interface allowed application software to connect across the ARPANET by implementing higher-level communication protocols, an early example of the protocol layering concept incorporated to the OSI model.In 1983, TCP/IP protocols replaced NCP as the ARPANET's principal protocol, and the ARPANET then became one component of the early Internet.NCP provided a standard set of network services that could be shared by several applications running on a single host computer. This led to the evolution of application protocols that operated, more or less, independently of the underlying network service. When the ARPANET migrated to the Internet protocols in 1983, the major application protocols migrated with it.

Â­The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments today in a case called Kirtsaeng v. Wiley, and their final decision could help shape the future of "first sale," a legal doctrine that underpins the right to sell, lend, or give away the things you buy, even if those things contain copyrighted elements.First sale provides the legal framework for marketplaces like used bookstores, flea markets, garage sales, and eBay. Itâ€™s crucial to making sure U.S. copyright holders canâ€™t dictate, for decades, what you do with the books, CDs, DVDs, games, etc., that you buy. But book publisher Wiley says it doesnâ€™t apply if the copyright holder is clever enough to ensure the product in question is manufactured outside of the United States.The Kirtsaeng case specifically deals with textbooks, but the Courtâ€™s decision is likely to affect a range of markets and consumers. First, many of the goods that people purchase every day are manufactured overseas and have some components or logos on the packaging that are subject to copyright law. In fact, the Swiss watchmaker Omega successfully sued Costco for copyright infringement because the retailer was reselling genuine Omega watches, purchased abroad, that happened to have the Omega logo on them. Second, if the Supreme Court rules in Wileyâ€™s favor, U.S. copyright holders will likely ensure that as many of their works as possible are manufactured outside the United States, so that they, too, can escape that pesky first sale doctrine.This dispute, however, is still just a skirmish in a larger battle to protect your right to actually own the things you buy. The first sale doctrine has long been a thorn in the side of many copyright holders, because it limits their ability to profit from and control secondary markets. In fact, attempts to lock down works after you purchase them extend back at least 100 years, when some publishers tried to set a minimum price at which you could resell their books. In more recent times, the problem has only gotten worse, with record labels attempting to restrict people's rights with "promotional" CDs to movie studios going after automated DVD rental services. Thankfully, Congress, the courts, and the market have repeatedly rejected those efforts.So big media has embraced an alternative approach: bypass the first sale doctrine by recasting every sale as a mere license agreement. That ebook you bought? Licensed. That MP3? Licensed. And these end-user license agreements, or EULAs, donâ€™t just prevent resale â€” they impose a variety of onerous terms of use as a condition of clicking the "buy" button for digital works sold online. It's an attempt to chip away at the rights consumers have long enjoyed in order to protect a legacy business model. That means the fight for first sale is also a fight against the proliferation of EULAs.It's good that the Supreme Court is hearing Kirtsaeng this term â€” in fact, we joined a brief encouraging them to â€” but the story isn't necessarily over once the decision comes down. The next step might be for Congress to respond with legislation. If so, they need to know what consumers think: if it looks like a sale and feels like a sale, it's a sale, with all the accompanying rights and privileges. We're joining our friends at Demand Progress in giving you tools to ask your Congressmembers to defend your rights in your digital goods.We know how vigorous the copyright industry lobby is about pushing for laws in their favor, even when they're against the public interest. It's important we let Congress know now that we want to see first sale alive and well and protecting our rights in the things we buy, even if they are digital goods and the sale is labeled a license.If the copyright industry has its way, you may have to seek permission or face penalties when you resell or tinker with the things you've bought. And if that comes to pass, then we've all been owned.EFF is teaming up with Demand Progress and Free Software Foundation to raise awareness about this issue and fight back.

Doctors use different standards to judge scientific research depending on who funded it. They judge research funded by industry as less rigorous, have less confidence in the results, and are less likely to prescribe new drugs than when the funding source is either the NIH or unknown â€“ even when the apparent quality of the research is the same.Those were the results of a study published by Harvard researchers Dr. Aaron Kesselheim and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine last month. The story has received a fair amount of coverage since then, including being analyzed by theÂ Scientific AmericanGuest Blog, the Los Angeles Times, and the New York Times.Thereâ€™s a question of ethical and practical relevance embedded in this: is it justifiable to judge a paper by its author or funding source â€“ even when you cannot discern a difference in quality?The perspective from much of the medical side seems to be a definite yes. The divide between doctors and so-called â€œBig Pharmaâ€? is nothing new. Pharma has a bad reputation in the medical community, and there is history to back it. One of the most well-known scandals involved Vioxx being taken off the market in 2004 after Merck admitted it withheld information about known adverse risk of heart disease, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. In 2008, physician and former Editor in Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine Marcia Angell wrote, â€œBias in the way industry-sponsored research is conducted and reported is not unusual and by no means limited to Merck.â€? In 2011, Harriet Washington published a piece inÂ The American Scholar highlighting some of the ways industry has misled and manipulated data, which include: comparing a new drug against a placebo rather than against another treatment option, comparing drugs to competitors in wrong dosages, pairing a drug with one known to work well, ending a trial prematurely when they see â€œclues that the trial is going south,â€? and cherry-picking only positive findings to report. This type of behavior can and should be called out as scientific misconduct, and those who commit it must be held accountable.But if thereâ€™s something just a bit unsavory about judging a paper solely by who wrote it, thereâ€™s good reason for it. The scientific world prides itself on judging content of ideas, not presumed integrity of authors. Itâ€™s the rationale behind the widespread practice of research journals blinding reviewers of authorsâ€™ names. Using any criteria other than quality in scientific evaluation is admittedly a kind of bias â€“ something we are usually quite wary of in science. As the authors of the study succinctly put it, â€œThe methodologic rigor of a trial, not its funding disclosure, should be a primary determinant of its credibility.â€? Moreover, if weâ€™re comfortable using authorship as a proxy for quality, itâ€™s not an absurd leap to start extending that approach to authors outside of industry. Itâ€™s not uncommon to hear accusations of industry bias because of self-interest in financial gain; but imagine if we started hearing sweeping accusations that young researchers, for example, should be trusted less because of their self-interest in trying to advance their careers. Industry is not alone in being capable of bias. The problem of publishing only positive results, for instance, is a recognized problem that has been discussed in the scientific community at large for years.There are also practical concerns of being overly dismissive of industry. Amidst the history of manipulation and fraud, there are medical contributions too. In the New York Times, surgeon and author Pauline Chen cited data showing thatÂ industry was responsible for nearly 60 percent of the more than $100 billion spent on research in 2007. Using authorship ties as a proxy for quality means possibly overlooking research of potential value for patients.So why not just use quality, removing the need to probe into researchersâ€™ background, affiliations, and motivations? Unfortunately, letting the data speak for themselves is not always possible. The low quality parts could be found in what does not make it to print. In the list of misconduct Washingtonâ€™s article described, ending a trial prematurely and failing to report negative results are forms of misconduct that would not be transparent from a paper alone. Similarly, failing to report side effects, as in the Vioxx scandal, is another way relevant data can be hidden. Thatâ€™s conscious and explicit manipulation, but thereâ€™s evidence for unconscious manipulation too. Numerous studies have found that the â€œfunding bias,â€? in which conclusions of research are more likely to agree with the sponsorâ€™s aims, is a real phenomenon. While unconscious bias is again not unique to industry, thereâ€™s something to be said for awareness of the trend where it has been clearly tracked.At the end of all this, we are left with two competing facts: 1) Industry sometimes produces valuable research that contributes to patient care. 2) There is also a significant history of manipulation. Is it possible to reconcile these two facts, in a way that is both vigilant against misconduct but also doesnâ€™t pass over potentially valuable findings?I think the last point about quality not always being transparent is the critical fact. Given that itâ€™s entirely scientifically feasible for a study that appears to be of good quality to actually be flawed, holding research conducted by authors with a dubious history seems justifiable. Should you dismiss industry across the board? Probably not. I think the authorsâ€™ caution against the dangers of excessive skepticism is sensible. I also agree that more â€œfundamental strategiesâ€? such as increased protocol and data transparency will make the whole process of determining quality easier. But as it stands, those doctors in the study voicing skepticism about the conclusions of industry sponsored research is understandable. As it goes, a critical eye and looking to others to replicate findings before you embrace new conclusions is probably a good approach to research in general, no matter who the initial authors are.

With 100 million first-grade-aged children worldwide having no access to schooling, the One Laptop Per Child organization is trying something new in two remote Ethiopian villagesâ€”simply dropping off tablet computers with preloaded programs and seeing what happens.The goal: to see if illiterate kids with no previous exposure to written words can learn how to read all by themselves, by experimenting with the tablet and its preloaded alphabet-training games, e-books, movies, cartoons, paintings, and other programs.Early observations are encouraging, said Nicholas Negroponte, OLPCâ€™s founder, at MIT Technology Reviewâ€™s EmTech conference last week.The devices involved are Motorola Xoom tabletsâ€”used together with a solar charging system, which OLPC workers had taught adults in the village to use. Once a week, an OLPC worker visits the villages and swaps out memory cards so that researchers can study how the machines were actually used.After several months, the kids in both villages were still heavily engaged in using and recharging the machines, and had been observed reciting the â€œalphabet song,â€? and even spelling words. One boy, exposed to literacy games with animal pictures, opened up a paint program and wrote the word â€œLion.â€?The experiment is being done in two isolated rural villages with about 20 first-grade-aged children each, about 50 miles from Addis Ababa. One village is called Wonchi, on the rim of a volcanic crater at 11,000 feet; the other is called Wolonchete, in the Rift Valley. Children there had never previously seen printed materials, road signs, or even packaging that had words on them, Negroponte said.Earlier this year, OLPC workers dropped off closed boxes containing the tablets, taped shut, with no instruction. â€œI thought the kids would play with the boxes. Within four minutes, one kid not only opened the box, found the on-off switch â€¦ powered it up. Within five days, they were using 47 apps per child, per day. Within two weeks, they were singing ABC songs in the village, and within five months, they had hacked Android,â€? Negroponte said. â€œSome idiot in our organization or in the Media Lab had disabled the camera, and they figured out the camera, and had hacked Android.â€?Elaborating later on Negroponteâ€™s hacking comment, Ed McNierney, OLPCâ€™s chief technology officer, said that the kids had gotten around OLPCâ€™s effort to freeze desktop settings. â€œThe kids had completely customized the desktopâ€”so every kidsâ€™ tablet looked different. We had installed software to prevent them from doing that,â€? McNierney said. â€œAnd the fact they worked around it was clearly the kind of creativity, the kind of inquiry, the kind of discovery that we think is essential to learning.â€?â€œIf they can learn to read, then they can read to learn.â€?In an interview after his talk, Negroponte said that while the early results are promising, reaching conclusions about whether children could learn to read this way would require more time. â€œIf it gets funded, it would need to continue for another a year and a half to two years to come to a conclusion that the scientific community would accept,â€? Negroponte said. â€œWeâ€™d have to start with a new village and make a clean start.â€?The idea of dropping off tablets outside of the context of schools is a new paradigm for OLPC. Through the late 2000s, the company was focused on delivering a custom miniaturized and ruggedized laptop, the XO, of which about 3 million have been distributed to kids in 40 countries. Deployments went to schools including ones in Peru.Giving computers directly to poor kids without any instruction is even more ambitious than OLPCâ€™s earlier pushes. â€œWhat can we do for these 100 million kids around the world who donâ€™t go to school?â€? McNierney said. â€œCan we give them tool to read and learnâ€”without having to provide schools and teachers and textbooks and all that?â€?

Back when Firefox 2 was released (six years ago this week!), the Internet Explorer team started a friendly tradition of sending Mozilla a cake as congratulations. This continued for Firefox 3 and Firefox 4. After Firefox switched from major releases once or twice a year to incremental updates every six weeks, they sent us a cupcake for the next few updates instead.I thought it would be fun to revive the tradition by ordering a cake for the IE team for the IE10 release today. Here it is right after I picked it up from Baked Custom Cakes, with a Firefox logo in painted fondant:Fellow Mozilla developer Eitan Isaacson drove with my wife Sarah and me to Microsoft Building 50 in Redmond, where program manager Jacob Rossi helped us deliver the cake to a group of IE team members:The IE team posted their thanks through their official Twitter account. (As you can see from their picture, the bottom border of the cake was slightly restyled in transit.) Just 30 minutes later, Michael Bolan tweeted that the cake was gone. I hear the sugary Firefox logo was eaten soon after.So congratulations to the Internet Explorer team on your latest release, and we hope you enjoyed the cake!

Following the furor over the company's mapping service, the iOS software chief refused to sign a letter apologizing for its shortcomings and got the boot as a result, the Wall Street Journal reported.The exit of Apple iOS software chief Scott Forstall was apparently anything but quiet. Forstall was forced out after he refused to sign a letter apologizing for problems with Apple Maps, according to the Wall Street Journal.The New York Times confirmed the firing, along with the unrelated ouster of Apple's new retail chief, John Browett.The Journal reported that some within Apple considered Forstall a divisive figure who "never fit into the culture at Apple," and who had long rankled other company execs but enjoyed the confidence of Steve Jobs. As WSJ reporter Jessica Lessin wrote:In fact, Forstall recently sent an email to some of the folks on Apple's iOS software team saying that the group "wasn't working on enough big ideas in mobile software," according to the WSJ. That's effectively saying that Forstall thought the company was struggling to compete, so it's no surprise that tensions were mounting.Apple has said that Forstall will be replaced by Craig Federighi in 2013. Federighi will oversee both the iOS and OS X groups under one umbrella.

The company tells CNET that sales of its flagship Galaxy S III actually rose following the unveiling of the iPhone 5, the latest illustration of its run to the top.The Korean conglomerate's flagship Galaxy S III had four of its five best-selling weeks in the U.S. after the iPhone 5 was unveiled, Samsung told CNET.The spike after the iPhone 5 launch suggests that consumers hung around to see what Apple had to show off, weren't impressed, and went with a Galaxy S III instead."I was shocked by the numbers," Kevin Packingham, chief product officer of Samsung's U.S. mobile arm, said in an interview. "I thought: 'What the heck is going on here?'"It's just the latest bit of good news for a company that has enjoyed a remarkable run to the top of the smartphone business, allowing it to surpass Apple and dominate with a flagship brand that has virtually the same appeal as the iPhone.Samsung is poised to continue its run into the holidays as it drums up attention for its latest product, the extra-large Galaxy Note 2. In typical Samsung fashion, the company on Wednesday threw a splashy party for media, d-list celebrities, and select Samsung fans in Manhattan's old Post Office headquarters, capping off the night with a performance by Kanye West."It's the holiday season and they needed something to generate buzz around its products," said Avi Greengart, who covers consumer products for Current Analysis.Keep in mind that the event was being held for a product that has already been announced globally and in the U.S., with reviews of the Galaxy Note 2 already widely available.But that didn't stop Samsung from going big with the event, and partly illustrates why the company has been so successful in battling Apple and establishing its leadership in the mobile world. Few companies have the resources, recognition, and heft to compete with Apple; Samsung just happens to be one of them.The investment in mobile has clearly paid off. Samsung earlier today posted a record quarterly profit of $7.4 billion, thanks largely to its Galaxy line of smartphones. In this industry, only Apple can boast of better results, having posted an $8.2 billion profit yesterday.Given the strength and resources of both companies, Apple and Samsung are likely to continue dominating the handset industry, applying even more pressure to its smaller rivals and potentially forcing some out of the business altogether.Winning 'Phablet' fans Credit Samsung's persistence in creating a new segment for the success of the original Galaxy Note. The device, bigger than a phone, but smaller than a tablet, was initially mocked by critics who thought it looked silly. But Samsung said the company has slowly won over people despite the large size, and pressed the category even further with the larger Galaxy Note 2.Samsung said that it had sold 10 million units of the Galaxy Note in the first nine months of availability around the world, but it's unclear how well it actually did in the U.S. The first Galaxy Note debuted earlier this year with AT&T before later getting picked up by T-Mobile USA as well. But given that a majority of smartphone sales at AT&T are made up of iPhones, there's a question mark for how much share the Galaxy Note actually got.Packingham insisted that the Galaxy Note was "tremendously successful," and that its performance convinced other carriers to add it to their lineup. This time around, the Galaxy Note 2 will be sold by all four national carriers, as well as a few regional ones."It's impressive that they have all the carriers lined up," Greengart said.J.K. Shin, head of Samsung's mobile business, has high expectations for the Galaxy Note 2, and told reporters at a briefing that he expects it to sell three times more quickly than the previous version, hitting 3 million units in the first 90 days.Samsung's more bullish because the Galaxy Note 2 has the benefit of wider availability and higher awareness from consumers, Packingham said. He added that carriers like the device because it targets the kind of customers they want to go after: power users looking for more from their mobile devices and well-off enough to buy the product.Galaxy Note 2 vs. iPad Mini? At $299.99 with a two-year contract, the Galaxy Note 2 isn't for bargain seekers.In fact, it's only $30 less expensive than the recently released iPad Mini from Apple. (A cellular version starts at $459.) There are, of course, fundamental differences between the two devices, with the Galaxy Note 2 sold more as a phone with a smartphone plan and seen as more of a primary device, while the iPad Mini is more a complementary device. Still, they also aren't that far apart when it comes to size.Packingham doesn't believe that the Galaxy Note 2 will compete with the iPad Mini. Samsung has a lot of experience with 7-inch tablets, with its Galaxy Tab being one of the first such Android devices, and Packingham said that the customers who buy them are different than ones who would buy the Galaxy Note 2.While Samsung isn't the first to sell a 5-inch device, the company does take credit for creating this new category of tweener devices. (Internally, executives don't refer to them as "phablets.") The Galaxy Note has spawned follow-up attempts, including the Optimus Vu from LG, known as the Intuition at Verizon Wireless. Packingham, however, was fairly dismissive of other attempts."Clearly in this segment, the Note stands alone," he said.

People increasingly have more than one device, and they switch between them many times a day. Nexusâ€”Googleâ€™s hardware line for Android devicesâ€”gets rid of the hassle. Just sign in with your Google Account and everything is there ready to go, whatever device youâ€™re using: photos, emails, contacts, bookmarks, even your entertainment on Google Play.Today, weâ€™re excited to announce three great new Nexus devices â€¦ in small, medium and large. And they all run Android 4.2, a new flavor of Jelly Beanâ€”which includes the latest version of Google Now and other great new features.Nexus 4 with Google Now and Photo Sphere Nexus 4 is our latest smartphone, developed together with LG. It has a quad-core processor which means it's super fast, a crisp 4.7" (320 ppi) display that's perfect for looking at photos and watching YouTube, and with wireless charging you just set the phone down on a charging surface to power it up, no wires needed. While Nexus 4 is incredibly powerful under the hood, it also features the latest version of Jelly Bean, Android 4.2â€”the simplest and smartest version of Android yet. Starting with the camera, we've reinvented the photo experience with Photo Sphere, which lets you capture images that are literally larger than life. Snap shots up, down and in every direction to create stunning 360-degree immersive experiences that you can share on Google+ with friends and familyâ€”or you can add your Photo Sphere to Google Maps for the world to see.Android 4.2 brings other great goodies like Gesture Typing, which lets you glide your finger over the letters you want to type on the keyboardâ€”it makes typing fast, fun and a whole lot simpler. Android 4.2 also adds support for wireless display so you can wirelessly watch movies, YouTube videos and play games right on your Miracast-compatible HDTV.Learn more about all of the new features of Android 4.2, Jelly Bean, here.Google Nowâ€”even more useful We designed Google Now to make life simpler by giving you the right information at just the right time in easy to read cards, before you even ask. And the feedback has been awesome. So today weâ€™re adding more cards that we hope youâ€™ll find useful. Flight information, restaurant reservations, hotel confirmations and shipping detailsâ€”how often have you found yourself wading through your email to get this information at the last moment? So next time you book a table for dinner, youâ€™ll get a reminder with all the details without ever having to lift a finger. Youâ€™ll also get cards for nearby attractions, interesting photo spots, movies times at nearby theaters or concerts by your favorite artists.Nexus 7: Thin, light and now even more portableNexus 7 brings you the best of Googleâ€“YouTube, Chrome, Gmail, Mapsâ€“and all the great content from Google Play in a slim, portable package that fits perfectly in your hand. To give you more room for all that great content you can now get Nexus 7 with 16GB ($199) or 32GB ($249) of storage. But we also wanted to make this highly portable tablet even more mobile. So we added HSPA+ mobile data. Nexus 7 is now also available with 32GB and HSPA+ mobile ($299), which can operate on more than 200 GSM providers worldwide, including AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S. Nexus 10: Powerful and shareable Nexus 10 is the ultimate tablet for watching movies or reading magazines. We wanted to build a premium entertainment device, so we partnered with Samsung to do just that. Nexus 10 is the highest resolution tablet on the planet with a 10.055" display at 2560-by-1600 (300ppi), that's over 4 million pixels right in your hands. It comes with a powerful battery that will get you up to nine hours of video playback and more than 500 hours of standby time. With a set of front-facing stereo speakers, you can watch movies right from your Nexus 10 and they simply sound awesome. But what makes Nexus 10 unique is that it's the first truly shareable tablet. With Android 4.2, you can add multiple users and switch between them instantly right from the lockscreen. We believe that everyone should have quick and easy access to their own stuff -- email, apps, bookmarks, and more. That way, everyone can have their own home screens, their own music, and even their own high scores.Google Play: More entertainment, more countriesWeâ€™ve recently added a ton of great new entertainment to Google Play, such as movies and TV shows from Twentieth Century Fox. Earlier this year we expanded our service beyond movie rentals and now you can purchase movies and build a library of your favorites in Google Play. Today weâ€™re bringing movie purchasing to more countries - Canada, the U.K., France, Spain and Australia.Weâ€™re also excited to announce two new partnerships. Weâ€™re now working with Time, Inc. to bring you even more magazines like InStyle, PEOPLE, TIME and others. And weâ€™ve partnered with Warner Music Group who will be adding their full music catalog with new songs coming each day. Weâ€™re now working with all of the major record labels globally, and all the major U.S. magazine publishers, as well as many independent labels, artists and publishers.On November 13, we're bringing music on Google Play to Europe.  Those of you in the U.K, France, Germany, Italy and Spain will be able to purchase music from the Google Play store and add up to 20,000 songsâ€”for freeâ€”from your existing collection to the cloud for streaming to your Android devices or web browser. Weâ€™re also launching our new matching feature to streamline the process of uploading your personal music to Google Play. Weâ€™ll scan your music collection and any song we match against the Google Play catalog will be automatically added to your online library without needing to upload it, saving you time. This will be available in Europe at launch on November 13 and is coming to the U.S. soon after. This will all be for freeâ€”free storage of your music, free matching, free syncing across your devices and free listening.Great valueWeâ€™ve always focused on building great devices at great value.  And we think todayâ€™s devices offer the very best that money can buy. Here are more details on when and where you can pick up your next Nexus device:Nexus 4: 8GB for $299; 16GB for $349; available unlocked and without a contract on 11/13 on the Google Play store in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain and Canada. The 16GB version will also be available through T-Mobile for $199, with a 2-year contract (check here for more details).Nexus 7: 16GB for $199 and 32GB for $249; available in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and Japan, and also through our retail partners Gamestop, Office Depot, Office Max, Staples and Walmart.Nexus 7 with 32GB and mobile data: $299 and unlocked, on sale 11/13 in the Google Play store in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain and  Canada.Nexus 10: 16GB for $399; 32GB for $499; available on 11/13 in the Google Play Store in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and Japan. You'll also be able to purchase the 32GB version in more than 2,000 Walmart stores in the U.S.A Nexus device is much more than simply a phone or tablet. Itâ€™s your connection to the best of Googleâ€”all of your stuff and entertainment, everywhere you go with no hassle.  Now you have three new Nexus devices, a new improved version of Jelly Bean and more entertainment than ever beforeâ€”all available on Google Play. The playground is open.

On the way to the Apple Store today to buy AppleCare+ for my wifeâ€™s new iPhone 5, we passed the new Microsoft Store, coincidentally in the middle of their Surface with Windows RT launch. (That is actually the productâ€™s name. â€œSurface with Windows RTâ€?.)They had set up a table and an Xbox demo in the hallway and were giving away â€œMicrosoft Surfaceâ€?-branded disposable rain ponchos (this entire mall is indoors, including the parking, and it didnâ€™t rain today) and muffin fragments (much like when you order a soda on a plane, they pour a third of it into a little plastic cup full of hollow ice cylinders, and they donâ€™t let you keep the rest of the can). An employee with a microphone in front of the Xbox kiosk was talking to the audience of nobody as if it were a dance party.The store is creepy: so many elements are embarrassingly similar to the Apple Store on the next floor. Microsoft even ripped off trivial elements that easily could have been different, such as the employee uniform. Thereâ€™s a huge elephant in the room, and we can all see it, but Microsoft still implicitly denies it.There were far more employees than customers, and I was curious, so I thought Iâ€™d stop in to take a look at Microsoftâ€™s new tablet. The employees in the store were overly enthusiastic, especially for 3:47 PM, and practically mobbed anyone who entered. â€œHEY! WELCOME TO THE MICROSOFT STORE! WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THE NEW SURFACE?â€?The salesman launched into an elaborate pitch. He wasnâ€™t a confident speaker, so the rote was obvious. I wanted to jump right in and start playing with the software, but the salesman kept butting in and driving â€œmyâ€? demo.The first thing he had me do was detach and reattach the keyboard cover. Click. He sold the keyboard cover hard. â€œNobody else has a cover like this.â€?The staff loved Adam so much that he later vomited in the Apple Store.The salesman then showed off the kickstand and started flipping through the applications himself. I wondered if this was how the press got to â€œuseâ€? the Surface before today.When we finally broke the salesmanâ€™s concentration so we could pick it up and start playing with it, Tiff and I both had the same first impression: itâ€™s heavy. On paper, itâ€™s 1.5 pounds (without the half-pound keyboard), like the iPad 1 and a bit heavier than the iPad 3. But itâ€™s not just heavy: it feels dense, like the iPhone 4 and 4S (and notably not like the iPhone 5).Like the Zune, the Surface might always be competing with the previous-generation iPad. Microsoft has approximately matched the weight of the already-too-heavy iPad 3 right as Apple is releasing the far lighter iPad Mini. (And Microsoft just launched this tablet at $500 as everyone else is moving to much lower pricing.)I tried rotating the Surface. There was a long enough delay that I thought rotation just wasnâ€™t supported, then it kicked in and the newly laid out screen just popped in. No transition, no animation. I switched to a different app and tried the same thing with the same results. Rotation was always slow and sloppy.My demo was interrupted as another employee walked through the store, shouting enthusiastically, â€œWE HAVE WORKSHOPS IN THE BACK!â€? Nobody followed him there.The diagonally-oriented camera is strange. In the one orientation itâ€™s optimized for, itâ€™s slightly annoying. In any other orientation, itâ€™s almost intolerable. If I brought home a Surface and didnâ€™t know this was a design decision, I might assume the camera was broken and return it.The maps app is very sluggish and doesnâ€™t use vector graphics, making it feel old.iOS is so responsive and so liberal with animations that it has a very tactile feel, and rather than thinking â€œtap this button to openâ€? or â€œswipe across this box to shareâ€?, conceptually, you just move the things on the screen with your fingers.The distinction seems subtle, but itâ€™s important. Every action on the Surface feels deliberate. It feels like youâ€™re using a computer.The standard gestures donâ€™t help, requiring many in-from-the-edge swipes that not only arenâ€™t discoverable but also frequently conflict with scrolling. My gestures often didnâ€™t work, and it wasnâ€™t clear whether there just wasnâ€™t a hidden context menu at that moment or I just screwed up the swipe.Most of the animations also arenâ€™t helpful, with minimal spatial consistency. Many animations seem arbitrary, not hinting at anything behaviorally useful. Microsoft has applied animations and gestures in Windows 8 about as effectively as they applied color in Windows XP and transparency in Windows Vista: they knew that Apple had been successful with these features, so they made a checklist and just applied them haphazardly. â€œApple does animations, so now we do animations! Apple does gestures, so now we have gestures!â€?An employee was stationed by these big letters on the floor to instruct people to exit to the left, rather than stepping over them. Iâ€™ve never been given instructions on how to exit â€œother storesâ€?.The keyboards are both decent but unmemorable. Every Surface had its own Touch Cover (no physical key movement), and the employees were frantically passing around a single Type Cover (traditional slim keys). Since everyone wanted to try the Type Cover, I only got a few seconds with it, but it was comparable to good iPad keyboards like Logitechâ€™s.The Touch Cover is one of the Surfaceâ€™s biggest innovations. I thought I would hate it, but I didnâ€™t. Itâ€™s not like typing on a completely flat surface: each â€œkeyâ€? is raised slightly, so while there isnâ€™t any mechanical feedback, it does feel a bit like a keyboard.But since it responds to touches rather than mechanical pressure, you canâ€™t rest your fingers on it without triggering key presses. Your fingers must hover over it, which makes it easy to get misaligned from your expected positions and type a bunch of wrong characters. I had a hard time keeping alignment when I needed to stretch for the boundary keys, including Shift. Every time I typed a capital letter, I mistyped the next few letters.I couldnâ€™t type on the Touch Cover significantly faster than with the on-screen keyboard, so I question its purpose. Moreover, since the Touch Cover and Type Cover are so close in price and nearly indistinguishable in size and weight, Iâ€™m not sure why the Touch Cover exists at all other than to be different from â€œother tabletsâ€?. I donâ€™t know why someone would get it instead of the Type Cover.I went to another Surface and was greeted by another salesman. He also aggressively demoed the tablet for me, not letting me take over for more than three seconds at a time. It was obvious that they had all had the same training and were instructed to hard-sell the same talking points. The pitches were aggressive, fast-paced, and competitively defensive: they often mentioned â€œother tabletsâ€? and didnâ€™t let me forget which features were â€œnot available on any other tabletâ€?.He kept showing me the home screen and how to rearrange my icons, even though I kept wanting to explore the apps.He showed me Office, which was almost unusable: it was extremely sluggish, and touch targets were tiny and difficult to hit. He said this was the only tablet that could run Office, and if you used Office at work, this was therefore the only tablet that you could use at work. I played dumb.He asked what kind of computer I had at home. I told him the truth: that I used to have PCs, but now I had an old Mac and wanted to see the newer options out there.He showed me the L-shaped magnetic power connector, which can be plugged in either way, and showed how the magnet safely disconnects when the cable is pulled. It was vaguely familiar, but I continued to play dumb.I asked about 3G options, which the Surface doesnâ€™t have. He said it would restrict me from being able to use it anywhere (?), so I pushed a little further, and he said nobody wants two bills and you can just use tethering and why mess with the pesky 3G connection?He started selling me on the screen quality, saying it had a better screen than any other tablet. I asked, â€œWhat do you mean? Which other tablets?â€?I couldnâ€™t get him to say â€œiPadâ€?, but he did say it was better than â€œRetina screensâ€?.I broke character slightly. â€œI donâ€™t know, I saw the Retina iPad upstairs and I canâ€™t see the pixels at all on it. On here, I can see the pixels clearly.â€?â€œNo you canâ€™t. Where can you see the individual pixels?â€?â€œRight there. See, the left stroke on that capital â€˜Dâ€™ has one solid pixel on the left and a half-shaded pixel on the right.â€?He scaled the icon up to â€œzoom inâ€?, which, of course, changes what the physical pixels display. â€œI canâ€™t see any pixels!â€?I gave up. It was like arguing with a Tea Partier. But I figured, now that I had broken character a little, Iâ€™d risk a bit more.An Apple Store employee had stopped by after his shift, with the original blue shirt over his shoulder, to check out the Surface across from us. We smiled at him. I asked my salesman, â€œDid you apply to work at the Apple Store upstairs first, or did you always want to work here?â€?â€œNo, I went right here. Always been a PC guy. I like being able to customize things, like upgrading my sound cardâ€”â€?I couldnâ€™t resist. â€œOh, can you upgrade the sound card in the Surface?â€?â€œNo, butâ€¦ I started working here before the Surface came out.â€? (This Microsoft Store opened 28 days ago.) â€œBut you can add more RAM to this, right over here, this is an SDXC slot, which means Extra Capacity.â€?Like John Moltz, Iâ€™m left to ask the question: why buy a Surface instead of an iPad? For the price, you can almost buy two baseline iPad Minis. Or you can buy a 32 GB iPad Mini with LTE and a Smart Cover.But I donâ€™t think many Surface buyers are going to comparison-shop with the iPad, or vice versa. Itâ€™s very clear who the Surface is for, and itâ€™s not us.The Surface is partially for Microsoftâ€™s world of denial: the world in which this store contains no elephants and Microsoft invented the silver store with the glass front and the glowing logo and blue shirts and white lanyards and these table layouts and the modern tablet and its magnetic power cable. In that world, this is a groundbreaking new tablet that you can finally use at work and leave your big creaky plastic Dell laptop behind when you go to the conference room to have a conference call on the starfish phone with all of the wires and dysfunctional communication.But itâ€™s also for people like that salesman who donâ€™t agree with Appleâ€™s choices: people who want to have more hardware options, more customization, more hackability, and fewer people saying â€œnoâ€? to what they can do on their devices.Appleâ€™s products say, â€œYou canâ€™t do that because we think it would suck.â€? Microsoftâ€™s products say, â€œWeâ€™ll let you try to do anything on anything if you really want to, even if it sucks.â€?People who dislike Appleâ€™s approach or whose requirements are incompatible with it will always exist in great numbers, and the Surface is for them. Itâ€™ll probably sell well, especially if Microsoft can expand their retail presence quickly.But itâ€™s not for me at all. Not even for testing, experimenting, or curiosity. It feels too much like using a Windows PC, which was exactly Microsoftâ€™s intention, and it will appeal to people who want that. But thatâ€™s a world I fled 8 years ago with no intention of returning.

Hello from Advertising Week! You may remember a couple months ago at another industry event across the pond I shared how we were bringing in creative agency partners earlier than ever before to co-ideate on potential advertising opportunities with Windows 8 Ads in Apps. Bringing partners on board from the beginning is vital to the long-term success of the Windows 8 ecosystem. Working together in the co-ideation process demonstrates what can be gained from great collaboration when you involve creativity and technology. Itâ€™s exciting to see how weâ€™re driving innovation in this opportunity to create new industry standards.Weâ€™ve enjoyed digging in and getting creative with folks from the IAB creative board including Big Spaceship, Razorfish, Team Detroit, Universal McCann and Y&R Group on blue sky thinking for in-app ad concepts, as we are considering Windows 8 a brand new advertising canvas that offers endless opportunities. The connected user interface and unique, fluid design of Windows 8 will encourage people to explore and discover ads without disrupting their experience. Based on that, we set out not to just create new ad formats â€“ our goal was to rethink the entire experience.The results of our co-ideation sessions and work are the first five unique, custom advertising scenarios that feature major brand campaign concepts within marquee publisher apps â€“ including Delta Airlines in an NBC News app, Finish Line in an LA Times app, Ford Fusion in a Chicago Tribune app, Jeep in an AccuWeather app and Goldfish Crackers in a Slacker Radio app. Below is snapshot of each, which you can also see in a quick video with our partners here.Delta is launching a new advertising campaign called â€œUpâ€? that is all about upping the ante in travel with the airline. The Razorfish creative team leveraged the unique, creative campaign and content of â€œUpâ€? to conceptualize a Windows 8 Ads in Apps concept for Delta in the NBC News app that is an intuitive, contextually relevant and immersive experience, which is ideal for a tablet. When in the NBC News app, a user can initiate the ad by touching on the Delta tile so that it expands up the screen. The user can swipe â€˜upâ€™ to continue a visual journey of a travel experienceâ€”from checking in at the airport, to bags going up the ramp, until the plane is up in the skyâ€”that is simple and aspirational. Once the experience is closed, users are returned to the NBC News app content.Big Spaceship came up with a simple, yet compelling concept for Finish Line called, "Elements Change, Running's Eternal." The Big Spaceship team was excited about how Windows 8 encourages advertisers to create ads that deserve attention, rather than simply shouting messages, blinking repeatedly or interrupting people. As a result, the Windows 8 Ads in Apps concept for Finish Line is beautiful and fun to explore. In the sports section of the LA Times app, the Finish Line ad opens into a panoramic format that show a day in the life of a female athlete who loves to run. The concepts encourages people to follow her journey while showcasing Finish Line products through strategically placed â€œhot spotsâ€? on the runner that allows people to touch to learn more.Team Detroit created a Windows 8 Ads in Apps concept for Ford Fusionâ€™s new ad campaign that leveraged the consumer-first architecture of Windows 8 to tell a story and present content in a way that is non-intrusive and within the context of what the consumer wants and when. The team created an advertising concept with a dynamic background that is subtle and contextual, and empowers the user to control their brand experience. Shown within the Chicago Tribune app, as consumers scroll left to right, they see environmental changes in the background that are brought to life through dynamic layering of elements and timeline based animation with three advertisement spots highlighting various components of the Ford Fusion story.Universal McCann/Sapient created a dynamic Windows 8 Ads in Apps concept for Jeep within the AccuWeather app that speaks to how its new vehicle is ready for all weather. Once inside the AccuWeather app, the user scrolls through the content to the right until they come to the end and â€˜bumpâ€™ into the Jeep ad, which features engaging animation and a beautiful experience that encourages users to click. Once a user engages, the Jeep ad expands to a full-screen experience where the user can thumb through informative text, graphics and video elements.Pepperidge Farm is looking to expand beyond its typical moms audience to reach teens â€“ which is known as challenging to connect with in general. Y&R identified Slacker Radio as an ideal publishing partner to reach teens in their environment, and developed a Windows 8 Ads in Apps concept featuring a branded experience without having to leave the app. Y&R had to make it more than just awareness â€“ with teens itâ€™s all about selling indirectly to them to get them engaged. The team created the â€œMusic Visualizerâ€? with Goldfish Crackers that can play or work with any kind of music within the Slacker Radio app. The Goldfish crackers jump and literally dance to the music based on the beat/sound wave experience.The pairings were determined through ongoing conversations between the agencies, brands and publishers with the goal of matching like-minded audiences and creating organic, contextually relevant experiences. For instance, Jeep partnered with AccuWeather because weather is inherent to the driving experience and it mapped perfectly to their new all-weather, all-terrain Jeep vehicle.These concepts showcase how digital advertising can be more interactive and revolve around customer-initiated experiences that can be beautiful, relevant and useful.

Following the Amazon Web Services outage earlier this week, major sites and platforms are experiencing outages today, including at least Dropbox and Google App Engine. At the time of writing itâ€™s unclear how the two downtimes are related, but Tumblrâ€™s performance issues earlier today point to a clue.The blogging company told us in a statement: â€œTumblr is experiencing network problems following an issue with one of our uplink providers. Recovery is moving quickly and we will return to full service shortly.â€? Internet Traffic Report is reporting major packet loss in North America as well as issues in Asia (the problem is large enough that itâ€™s spilling into the rest of the world):At the time of writing, Dropbox is giving the following error (although it does seem to go back and forth every once in a while):Google App Engine is meanwhile timing out, and actually the Google Developers domain as a whole is having trouble loading. This is affecting Googleâ€™s own properties, such as Android Developers, as well as many other third-party Web sites that rely on App Engine. They are showing errors like this one (ironically, this is for BreakingNews.com):Even YouTube is experiencing issues; Downrightnow is calling it a â€œLikely Service Disruption,â€? although itâ€™s working fine for us:We have contacted both Dropbox and Google about these issues. We will update this article when we hear back.Update at 12:05PM EST: Dropbox appears to be coming back. Google App Engine is still down and out, and the search giant has classified the issue as an â€œAnomalyâ€? (talk about understatement) over at Google App Engineâ€™s System Status page. â€œApp Engine is currently experiencing serving issues. The team is actively working on restoring the service to full strength.â€? We are told to keep an eye on this Google Groups thread for more information.Update at 12:35PM EST: Cedexis has posted Google App Engine traffic details for today, which show things may be starting to return to normal:Update at 1:15PM EST: Google has posted an explanation.At approximately 7:30am Pacific time this morning, Google began experiencing slow performance and dropped connections from one of the components of App Engine. The symptoms that service users would experience include slow response and an inability to connect to services. We currently show that a majority of App Engine users and services are affected. Google engineering teams are investigating a number of options for restoring service as quickly as possible, and we will provide another update as information changes, or within 60 minutes.Update at 1:50PM EST: Google App Engine is starting to come back.Update at 2:10PM EST: Itâ€™s down again. Google has more.We are continuing work to correct the ongoing issues with App Engine. Operation has been restored for some services, while others continue to see slow response times and elevated error rates. The malfunction appears to be limited to a single component which routes requests from users to the application instance they are using, and does not affect the application instances themselves. Weâ€™ll post another status update as more information becomes available, and/or no later than one hour from now.Update at 3:45PM EST: All systems are go.At this point, we have stabilized service to App Engine applications. App Engine is now successfully serving at our normal daily traffic level, and we are closely monitoring the situation and working to prevent recurrence of this incident. This morning around 7:30AM US/Pacific time, a large percentage of App Engineâ€™s load balancing infrastructure began failing. As the system recovered, individual jobs became overloaded with backed-up traffic, resulting in cascading failures. Affected applications experienced increased latencies and error rates. Once we confirmed this cycle, we temporarily shut down all traffic and then slowly ramped it back up to avoid overloading the load balancing infrastructure as it recovered. This restored normal serving behavior for all applications. Weâ€™ll be posting a more detailed analysis of this incident once we have fully investigated and analyzed the root cause.Google has sent over an apologetic statement.Update at 4:15PM EST: Now itâ€™s Facebookâ€™s turn.Update at 9:00PM EST: Google has more information on the outage today over on its App Engine blog.

Four years after discovering that militants were tapping into drone video feeds, the U.S. military still hasnâ€™t secured the transmissions of more than half of its fleet of Predator and Reaper drones, Danger Room has learned.Â The majority of the aircraft still broadcast their classified video streams â€œin the clearâ€? â€” without encryption. With a minimal amount of equipment and know-how, militants can see what Americaâ€™s drones see.Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have become the single most important weapon in Americaâ€™s far-flung pursuit of violent extremists. Hundreds of American Predators and Reapers fly above Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan â€” watching suspected enemies, and striking them when necessary.Â Nearly 3,000 people have been killedÂ in the decade-long drone campaign.â€œIf somebody could obtain reliable access to real-time Predator or Reaper video â€” without attribution or alerting U.S. military â€” that would Â a tremendous intel coup,â€? says Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. â€œThere is an insatiable demand from Predator and Reaper imagery in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Any reluctance to use those for spying or missile strikes places operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia at some risk.â€?Military officials have known about â€” and mostly shrugged off â€” the vulnerability since the development of the Predator in the 1990s. But the problem drew increased attentionÂ in 2008, when drone video footage was found on the laptops of Shiâ€™ite militants in Iraq, who were able to intercept the feed using a piece of $26 software. The Pentagon and the defense industry assured the public that theyâ€™d close the hole by retrofitting the robotic aircraft with new communications protocols and encrypted transceivers that would keep the video from being intercepted again.Four years into the effort, however, only â€œ30 to 50 percentâ€? of Americaâ€™s Predators and Reapers are using fully encrypted transmissions, a source familiar with the retrofitting effort tells Danger Room. The total fleet wonâ€™t see its communications secured until 2014. This source and others who work closely with drone operations say that drones flying overseas are among the first to get the newly secured equipment. They also noted that they are unaware of any incidents of militants using Americaâ€™s unmanned eyes in the sky to their advantage. â€œBut Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t,â€? the source adds. â€œAnd that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not happening.â€?This isnâ€™t the only vulnerability in the drone fleet. In March of 2011, an unknown software glitch caused a PredatorÂ stationed at a U.S. base inÂ Africa toÂ start its engine without human direction.Â Last October, as Danger Room first reported, Air Force technicians discovered aÂ virus infecting the dronesâ€™ remote cockpitsÂ in Las Vegas. It tookÂ weeks of sustained effortÂ to clean up the machines. The aircraft, which rely on GPS to guide them through the air, can run into problems if GPS signals are jammed in a particular area â€” something that can be done with cheap, commercially available hardware.Â Iranian officials claimed they hacked the GPS control signal of an advanced drone, though itâ€™sÂ impossible to verify that lofty claim.No one who works with UAVs is questioning the fundamental integrity of the drone fleet at the moment; it would take an incredibly sophisticated hacker toÂ commandeerÂ a Predator, for example. Nor is anyone pretending that this premiere tool of the U.S.global Â counterterror campaign is flawless.Predators and the larger, better-armed Reapers transmit video and accept instructions in one of two ways. The first is via satellite, to remote pilots and sensor operators who are often on the other side of the planet; these satellite communications are encrypted, and are generally considered secure.The second is through a radio frequency signal called the Common Data Link, which is used to share the droneâ€™s video feed with troops on the ground. The CDLâ€™s carrier signal â€” its specific pattern of frequencies, in a given order and for a given length of time â€” tells both transmitter and receiver on how to function. The problem is that the Predatorsâ€™ version of the CDL carrier signal (also known as a â€œwaveformâ€?) didnâ€™t include an order to encrypt the signal. So neither the transmitter on the drone nor the receivers that troops used on the ground employed encryption, either.There were reasons for this.Â The original Predator, just 27 feet long, was little more than a scaled-up model plane with an 85-horsepower engine. It had a payload of just half a ton for all its fuel, cameras and radios. And encryption systems can be heavy. (Big crypto boxesÂ are a major reasonÂ the Armyâ€™s futuristic universal radio ended up being too bulky for combat, for example.) With the early Predator models, the Air Force made the conscious decision to leave off the crypto.The flying branch was well aware of the risk. â€œDepending on the theater of operation and hostile electronic combat systems present, the threat to the UAVs could range from negligible with only a potential of signal intercept for detection purpose, to an active jamming effort made against an operating, unencrypted UAV,â€?Â the Air Force reported in 1996.Â â€?The link characteristics of the baseline Predator system could be vulnerable to corruption of down links data or hostile data insertions.â€?The Predator models steadily grew in power and payload, and took a big leap in dimensions and capability with the 36-foot-long Reaper version introduced in 2007. The Reaper has a 950-horsepower engine and a nearly 4,000-pound payload â€” more than enough capacity for crypto-enabled systems which, like all electronics, had shrunk in size and weight.The problem was that, by then, the military had rushed to the battlefield hundreds ofÂ Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receivers, orÂ RoversÂ â€“ rugged, laptop-sized receivers with screens for watching drone footage. And those early version of the Rovers were developed and distributed so fast, the military once again left the crypto off. â€œIt could be both intercepted (e.g., hacked into) and jammed,â€? e-mails an Air Force officer with knowledge of the program.Which mean the Pentagon was stuck, for a time. The military couldnâ€™t replace the old CDL waveform with something encryptable until the Rovers â€” and the radio transmitters aboard the Predators â€” could handle such a signal.Eventually, the Rovers began to be swapped out for newer models. The latest version, the â€œTactical Rover,â€? (.pdf) is about the size of an old-school mobile phone. It can use both the Advanced Encryption Standard an the triple-Data Encryption Standard to secure video feeds. There are now about a thousand of the units in the militaryâ€™s hands.And now, the Predators and Reapers are starting to get enhanced radios, too. â€œThe fleet-wide upgrade begins later this year and carries on for several years,â€? says Maj. Mary Danner-Jones, an Air Force spokesperson. The service is spending $12 million on crypto-enabled Vortex transceivers (.pdf).Thatâ€™s allowing a new, hardened waveform to be introduced throughout the Predator and Reaper fleet. The Air Force recently gave Predator-maker General Atomics Aeronautical SystemsÂ a $26 million contract to retrofit its drone cockpits to accept the carrier signal, among other enhancements.The question is why hasnâ€™t this happened sooner. After all,Â the Navy installed multiple layers of encryption inÂ theirÂ â€™bots some time ago. Navy spokesman Jamie Cosgrove tells Danger Room that â€œthe vast majorityâ€? of naval drones are encrypted â€“Â  â€œand have been since development.â€?One source who works on developing Navy UAVs, but is not authorized the speak on the record, explains why:Â â€?Standard unencrypted video is basically a broadcast to whoever can figure out the right carrier frequency, so essentially, we are simulcasting to battlefield commanders and the opposing force. If that opposing force knows we can see them and from where, they can take better evasive maneuvers.â€?Itâ€™s possible that none of the militants America is trying today are as sophisticated as the ones who intercepted that drone video in 2008. Itâ€™s possible that the value of such footage-from-above is so fleeting that extremists have never again bothered to grab it. But itâ€™s worth noting that Predator and Reaper video is considered by the U.S. military to be classified information. And when U.S. commanders on the ground get into a firefight, the first call they usually make is for a drone, so they can take a look at the battlefield through the eyes of a drone.

Of all the images that have ever been made, would you be able to select just 100 to represent our species and human achievement? Trevor Paglenâ€™s Last Pictures is a project to do not only that, but also launch those images intoÂ geosynchronousÂ orbit around Earth â€“ all so that long after humans are gone, any space-wanderer will be able to fathom what humanity was all about.The project is based on the idea that after billions of years, all signs of human civilization will have eroded away on Earth, but its satellites will still spin around the planet, making them the best bet for an indefinite time capsule.â€œAny group of people would come up with 100 totally different images, but that is part of the fun. Itâ€™s an impossible project. Part of it was to engage peoplesâ€™ imaginations,â€?Â says artist Trevor Paglen, who conceived of the concept and collaborated with scientists, anthropologists, curators and corporations to get the images into space.Writer and artistÂ Anya VenturaÂ coordinated the work of five researchers who whittled down the image selection fromÂ 10,000 to 500 to 100. With every choice open to debate, it was a mindful experience.â€œWeâ€™re inundated with images, but we donâ€™t stop to look at them,â€? says Ventura.Â â€?The Last Pictures necessitates the act of looking. Itâ€™s a project that sticks with me because of our discussions about what makes a good photograph.Â We were tackling issues of representation and decoding images.â€?But choosing the images was only the beginning â€“ two more giant problems loomed. Firstly, how does one fabricate those 100 images to survive billions of years in space? Secondly, how does one get them into orbit?Brian Wardle, associate professor at MITâ€™s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and director of theÂ Nano-Engineered Composite aerospace StructuresÂ (NECST) Consortium, consulted on design and fabricated the vessel for the images. He andÂ Professor Karl Berggren, a quantumÂ nano-structuresÂ expert, were mostly concerned with preventing diffusion â€“ the incredibly slow movement of molecules which over millions of years could potentially degrade the sharpness of the image.â€œBy using a single material, Silicon, and etching physical features in that material, the Artifact will maximally resist diffusion. Usually the â€˜sands of timeâ€™ erase writings through erosion, but in this case we used sand/Silicon against time to resist its effect,â€? says Wardle with a poetic flourish.To that end, theÂ Last PicturesÂ are nano-etched onto a silicon disc â€“ referred to within the project as â€œthe Artifactâ€? â€“ and secured within a gold-plated aluminum clamshell.Paglen now knew the images could survive, but how to get them up there?Creative Time, a stalwart New York arts organization andÂ Last Pictures partner, was on board to help with the logistics, but even when the project mangerÂ telephoned every company that put hardware into space they drew a blank.Short on options,Â Anne Pasternak, Executive Director ofÂ Creative Time, began making pleas to audience members at her numerous public speaking events for contacts within theÂ satelliteÂ industry. Two connections and a few phone calls later,Â Last PicturesÂ had an agreement withÂ EchoStar Corporation, a Colorado-basedÂ telecommunicationsÂ company responsible for maintaining Dish Networkâ€™s satellite fleet. (EchoStar also owns SlingBox.)Once the deal was done, Paglen waited for a window. It came in December 2011 when Palo Alto-basedÂ Space Systems Loral were in the final stages of manufacturing the next EchoStar satellite.â€œEchostar gave us a month to get the disc tested and flight ready,â€? says Paglen.Â â€?Many engineers stepped up over the Christmas holidays.â€?After two delayed launch attempts, the 6,600 kilograms EchoStar XVI is set for launchÂ on November 20th from the Baikonur CosmodromeÂ inÂ Kazakhstan, on the back of an ILS Proton Breeze M Rocket. EchoStarâ€™s main cargo is 32 Ku-band transponders which will deliver direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) signals back to earth for suped-up local HD channels among other things.Last Picturesâ€˜ efforts have reminded many of Â Carl Saganâ€™sÂ Voyager Golden RecordÂ which includedÂ 116 images of animals, food, architecture, portraits and daily human life, as well as sounds.Â Ventura says the Last Pictures team were a bit sniffy about the appropriateness of Saganâ€™s images to farily represent unified humanity but when they took on a similar selection process, â€œweÂ realizedÂ how difficult it was,â€? says Ventura.â€œAt the beginning we imagined the images as an archive, but later we started to think of them as a silent film, like poetry. We made aesthetic decisions,â€? says Paglen who in the book arranges many images in pairs based on formal relationships.Â â€?I guess thatâ€™s where my artistic influence came in.â€?Paglen and his team deliberately included images to challenge viewers.â€œWeâ€™re making cave paintings for the future,â€? he says. â€œA lot of images are enigmatic.Â Thereâ€™s stories outside of the images. Enough to keep the aliens on their toes!â€?One curve ball is an installation shot of Malevichâ€™s work at the Last Futurist Exhibition in St Petersburg, 1915.Â It is Paglenâ€™s nod to the convergence of art, philosophy and science and to the definitive differences between the American and the Russian space programs.â€œThe U.S. space program has mythologies attached to pioneering and conquering, but the Russian tradition is very different,â€? says Paglen. â€œIn the Russian tradition, the ultimate goal of humanity was to resurrect all humans. In the late 19th centuryÂ Russian CosmistsÂ such asÂ Nikolai FyodorovÂ believed we need to go to space to collect all the particles of all the people who had ever lived.Â Cosmism says going into space is going into the past.â€?The majority of the images, which are published in the Last Pictures book, carry layers of narrative. Percival Lowellâ€™s 19th century maps of â€œcanalsâ€? on Mars surface are typical of the tension between reality and perception. Lowell wasnâ€™t out to fool anyone but the conflagration of tiny aperture and a eye condition he wasnâ€™t aware of had him seeing things.â€œHe thought he was mapping canals on Mars, but he was really seeing blemishes in his own eye,â€? says Anya Ventura.No one on the team is pompous about the selection. Rather Last Pictures is an interstellar version of the question, â€œIf your house was burning down, which photos would you save?â€? Itâ€™s about questions, not necessarily answers.â€œItâ€™s a paradoxical project. It is about time and space, but also ambivalent,â€? says Paglen. â€œLast Pictures questions material circumstances. What does it mean that we make machines that exist as long as the sun?â€?For those who are uncurious about the answers to these questions, fear not. Ultimately the project taxed only a relatively small amount of resources.â€œThe Artifact hitched a ride on a satellite that was going up anyway, and the delta in payload was absolutely negligible relative to typical mass budgets and this one specifically,â€? saysÂ BrianÂ Wardle of MIT.The hostÂ satellite will onlyÂ broadcast signal andÂ orbit Earth for 15 years. Scheduled for 2027, the mission profile of Echostar XVI includes an end-of-life maneuver into a spacecraft junkyard just beyond the Clarke Belt.â€œCreative projects are rarely the result of a single personâ€™s efforts,â€? says Paglen.Â â€?Technologically, it is not hard to launch anÂ objectÂ into space. Emotionally, it has been difficult.â€?Last Pictures, the book, is published by University of California Press. The project is to be presented as an travelling exhibition in 2013.

Vid The big launch of Microsoftâ€™s Surface slab got off to an inauspicious start in Beijing after an elderly couple invaded the stage in an attempt to halt proceedings.Redmond launched the Windows RT tablet-cum-laptop device at a series of events starting at midnight across the country in partnership with retail giant Suning.However, the Thursday night outdoor launch in the capital attracted two rather irascible Chinese attendees among the hundreds of Microsoft fans keen to be the first in the world to get their hands on the tablet.The inevitable YouTube clip - see below - shows an old dear mount the stage in an attempt to kill the noise because it was apparently stopping her grandchildren from getting to sleep before school the next day.Her brave attempt ends in failure, though, as sheâ€™s unceremoniously bundled off the stage by two guards, followed by her husband, while the glamorous sparkly dancers try to complete their routine.Not quite the impression Microsoft wanted to make in China.Things went from bad to worse for the software giant in Asia after reports emerged that a high-profile live public demonstration of Windows 8 in downtown Taipei fell flat when the OS cocked up on some devices. Microsoft staff apparently had trouble closing apps on several all-in-one PCs and instead were forced to demo the new OS on tablets.â€œIt was pretty rushed to the launch date, and the user experience will improve,â€? marketing manager Yi-Fang Chu told the Wall Street Journal.â€œIt is a hardware issue, rather than a software one. Itâ€™s partly because of the large screen size of the all-in-ones.â€? Â®

Google has officially announced the Nexus 4, the latest phone in its Nexus line of flagship Android devices. Built by LG, the phone features a 4.7-inch 1280 x 768 IPS display, a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor â€” which Google claims is the fastest on the market â€” an 8 megapixel camera and a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera, and up to 16GB of storage. Oh, and the back is made of glass â€” etched, layered glass that sparkles with a strange, almost holographic depth.The executive vibe is balanced nicely by the playfulness of the backNot much of that should be surprising, as the phone had been thoroughly leaked around the web in the past few weeks. What is surprising is how much better it all looks in person. Compared to the LG Optimus G, which shares many of the same components, it's no contest â€” the Nexus 4 is a far nicer piece of hardware. It feels weighty and high-end, and the tight construction combined with the soft-touch plastic on the sides and chrome edging give it a solidly executive vibe â€” a vibe that's balanced nicely by the playfulness of Disco City on the back.The device will sell for $299 with 8GB of storage, or $349 with 16GB. A T-Mobile version will sell unlocked for $199 on a two-year contract. Alongside the improved screen and faster CPU, the Nexus 4 has 2GB of RAM, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, NFC, Bluetooth, and built-in compatibility with Google's latest accessory, the Wireless Charging Orb â€” an inductive charging dock. The phone also houses a sizable 2100 mAh battery, which the company claims will get you about 10 hours of talk time.There's no LTE hereAll that battery life would be great if the device was sporting LTE radios â€” but it is not. Google has decided to forgo stricter carrier partnerships in the US, which for now means that the company will only offer the device as an unlocked HSPA+ phone. That's a bit of a crushing blow to many, who expected Google's next flagship phone to go toe-to-toe with the iPhone 5 and the latest crop of Windows Phone devices.On the bright side, the 320 ppi IPS+ LCD screen is terrific â€” a massive upgrade over the so-so Galaxy Nexus display and competitive with the iPhone's 326 ppi Retina Display. And it's not just competitive in pixel density; the screen looks stunning. It's also laminated and uses LG's new "G2" technology which integrates the touch sensor into the Gorilla Glass 2 outer layer, making everything thinner as well as bringing the actual pixels closer to the surface of the display. (Apple uses a similar technique called "in-cell touch" on the iPhone 5, which integrates the touch sensor into the display panel.) The screen is also curved slightly at the edges, like it's been melted over the phone; Google says it's meant to improve swiping in from the sides of the device.Performance on the phone was snappy. Google execs we spoke with pointed out just how fast the new Snapdragon CPU is, and in our short time testing the phone, it seemed to rip through just about anything we threw at it with little or no hesitation.The screen is curved slightly at the edges, like it's been melted over the phoneFor those disappointed with the camera performance of the Galaxy Nexus, there's also a bright spot here. Literally. Photos taken with the Nexus 4 seem greatly improved over the last generation, and Google reps say that a lot of attention has been paid to the low-light performance of the camera. We won't know for sure just how much better it is than previous phones until we put the device through its full paces, but first impressions suggest a big improvement.On the software front, Google is launching Android 4.2 along with the Nexus 4 (and the Nexus 10 tablet), and it's got some killer new features. We have a full look at the software here, not to mention an exclusive feature on the inside story of the Android team here, but there are a few standout components of the OS update that are worth mentioning.For starters, Google has added widget functionality to the lock screen, meaning you can quickly glance at information without having to get into the phone. The camera has also been improved with a completely redesigned UI focused on single-handed input, and Google has added a Street View-like mode called Photo Sphere which makes panorama shots seem tiny by comparison. The company has also improved Google Now significantly (we have a big feature story on that too).Android now has a typing mode called Gesture Typing, which mimics the functionality of Swype in conjunction with standard tap typing. The company has also added a new quick settings menu to the notifications window, tweaked Gmail with much-needed features like swipe to archive and scale-to-fit messages (like the iPhone), and added new accessibility options that make Android easier than ever â€” for all users.We'll have a full review of the Nexus 4 soon; until then, be sure to check into all of the in-depth news on Google's announcements today.You can also watch this video on YouTube.

The system is powered by Nvidia GPUs and thought to be one of the two fastest supercomputers in the world. It's capable of making 20,000 trillion calculations each second.Forecasting for weather like this week's "Frankenstorm" may become a lot more accurate with the help of the Department of Energy's Titan supercomputer, a system that launched this month for open research development.The computer, an update to the Jaguar system, is operated in Tennessee by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, part of the DOE's network of research labs. Researchers from academia, government labs, and various industries will be able to use Titan -- believed to be one of the two most powerful machines in the world -- to research things such as climate change and alternative fuels."Why care about these big computers? It's really because society's got big problems," Steve Scott, chief technology officer of Nvidia's GPU accelerated computing business, said in a recent interview. "There are healthcare issues, lots of diseases across the board, an aging population. Energy is a huge problem facing the world and our country. ... Increasingly computers are used to solve these problems."As part of this month's launch of Titan, the DOE has awarded 4.7 billion supercomputing hours at Oak Ridge and another facility to 61 science and engineering projects with "high potential for accelerating discovery and innovation" through its Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program.While the areas of research vary, there are six main areas targeted for Titan, according to Nvidia's Scott:Â• Material science code. This is basically looking at material at the atom level, to understand its properties. It also involves figuring out how to construct new materials to have superior properties of strength, weight, and other characteristics.Â• Climate change. Researchers want to answer questions about what's going on, how to change it, how to adapt to it, etc.Â• Biofuels. This involves looking at certain plants -- like switchgrass -- and converting them into ethanol using an enzymatic process.Â• Nuclear energy. The technology can be used to simulate neutron flux in fusion and fission. It includes looking at a new form of fusion energy that would be safer and cleaner, as well as new fuels that would burn longer and cleaner.Â• Combustion. Titan can allow the simulation of combustion for researchers trying to optimize the fuel, process, and engine design to get a cleaner burning fuel."All of these areas have tremendous real world societal benefits," Scott said. "And they need high performance computing to drive them forward."None of the research would be possible without the massive computing abilities provided by Titan. The system is believed to be more powerful than the world's current top supercomputers from Japan and China, and it rivals the Top500's No. 1 machine from June, the DOE's Sequoia machine at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Titan is one of the new types of systems that combine discrete graphics chips, or GPUs, commonly used for videogames, along with standard microprocessors. In this case, Nvidia is providing the GPUs while the CPUs come from Advanced Micro Devices. Graphics chips are used to accelerate the number-crunching functions of supercomputers by allowing many tasks to be completed at once, and they require less power than CPUs alone.Titan is 10-times more powerful and five-times more energy efficient than Oak Ridge's last system, dubbed Jaguar. Oak Ridge says the use of GPUs combined with CPUs allows Titan to take up the same physical space as Jaguar while using only "marginally" more electricity (9 megawatts for Titan versus 7 megawatts for Jaguar).If Oak Ridge upgraded Jaguar by simply expanding the CPUs, the system would be more than four-times its current size and would consume more than 30 megawatts of power.Jaguar became the world's most powerful supercomputer in late 2009, and it held onto that title for a year before being passed by a Chinese system. The DOE's Sequoia system, meanwhile, nabbed the top spot in June with a performance of 16.32 petaflops. That system is powered by IBM chips and is used for classified national defense research.Titan may prove to be the most powerful system when the list is again released early next month, Scott said.It's almost mindboggling how fast Titan operates. The system is capable of churning through more than 20,000 trillion calculations each second -- or 20 petaflops -- by using GPUs.The system, developed by Cray, contains 18,688 nodes, with each containing a 16-core AMD Opteron processor and an Nvidia Tesla GPU based on the graphics chipmaker's Kepler architecture. Titan also has more than 700 terabytes of memory.Bill Blake, chief technology officer at Cray, said the industry is at an inflection point where GPUs become necessary to reach higher performance in supercomputers."For the foreseeable future, for sure the next 10 years plus, the industry will be on this inflection point of change because of accelerated computing," he said in a recent interview.

A smart road design that features glow in the dark tarmac and illuminated weather indicators will be installed in the Netherlands from mid-2013."One day I was sitting in my car in the Netherlands, and I was amazed by these roads we spend millions on but no one seems to care what they look like and how they behave," the designer behind the concept, Daan Roosegaarde, told Wired.co.uk. "I started imagining this Route 66 of the future where technology jumps out of the computer screen and becomes part of us."The Smart Highway by Studio Roosegaarde and infrastructure management group Heijmans won Best Future Concept at the Dutch Design Awards, and has already gone beyond pure concept. The studio has developed a photo-luminising powder that will replace road markings -- it charges up in sunlight, giving it up to ten hours of glow-in-the-dark time come nightfall. "It's like the glow in the dark paint you and I had when we were children," designer Roosegaarde explained, "but we teamed up with a paint manufacture and pushed the development. Now, it's almost radioactive".Special paint will also be used to paint markers like snowflakes across the road's surface -- when temperatures fall to a certain point, these images will become visible, indicating that the surface will likely be slippery. Roosegaarde says this technology has been around for years, on things like baby food -- the studio has just upscaled it.The first few hundred metres of glow in the dark, weather-indicating road will be installed in the province of Brabant in mid-2013, followed by priority induction lanes for electric vehicles, interactive lights that switch on as cars pass and wind-powered lights within the next five years.The idea is to not only use more sustainable methods of illuminating major roads, thus making them safer and more efficient, but to rethink the design of highways at the same time as we continue to rethink vehicle design. As Studio Roosegaarde sees it, connected cars and internal navigation systems linked up to the traffic news represent just one half of our future road management systems -- roads need to fill their end of the bargain and become intelligent, useful drivers of information too."Research on smart transportation systems and smart roads has existed for over 30 years -- call any transportation and infrastructure specialist and you'll find out yourself," Studio Roosegaarde comunications partner Emina Sendijarevic told Wired.co.uk. "What's lacking is the implementation of those innovations and making those innovations intuitive and valuable to the end-consumers -- drivers. For this, a mentality change needs to take place within a country and its people, but also within a company such as Heijmans."This is a story that goes beyond the 'Smart Highway' as such -- it's about the fact that Heijmans and Roosegaarde are not going to wait any longer for innovations to find their way through the political system, but will start building this highway now."All together, the studio has around 20 ideas that will eventually be rolled out and it has had inquiries from countries across the globe -- "India is really keen on it; they have a lot of blackouts there, it would be hallelujah to them".Roosegaarde also hopes to take his designs to the US west coast, where companies like Google already have autonomous vehicles driving round their campuses: "It amazes me that most innovation in the west coast is screen based -- I always imagined that technology jumping out of our screens and becoming part of our environment. It's incredibly important we keep imagining what our reality is going to look. A lot of people have told me along the way that what I wanted could not be done, and it's my job to prove them wrong."The Roosegaarde design promise comes as UK authorities announce that lights on motorways, residential streets and footpaths will be turned off or dimmed from as early as 9pm to save money (hundreds of thousands of pounds, in some cases) and to meet green targets.Some councils are, however, taking on the burden of installing new lights with dimmers, the cost of which will mean they will need to wait four to five years before they recoup the money -- by which time, they could have conserved cash for more efficient and safer ways to save on lighting costs. A Sunday Telegraph report has also revealed that nearly 5,000km of motorways and trunk roads in England are already unlit, 75km have their lights switched off between midnight and 5am and 73 percent of 134 councils surveyed switch off or dim lights, or plan to. Fully switching the lights off on major roads saved the Highways Agency just Â£400,000 in 2011.Paul Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, told the Telegraph: "We do know that most accidents happen in the dark. It's also comforting for people, especially if they arrive back from somewhere in the night, when they have got a late train. There are also suggestions that it increases crime. So it may save money in terms of energy but then you have to look at the cost in terms of security, safety and accidents, it may actually be more."According to a report by car insurance company Zurich Connect, there is an 11 percent increase in claims immediately following the winter clock change in the UK, when nights get darker earlier.

A slide taken from an online slideshow by a political targeting firm.Connect with Facebook to share articles you read on ProPublica. Learn more Â»If you're a registered voter and surf the web, one of the sites you visit has almost certainly placed a tiny piece of data on your computer flagging your political preferences. That piece of data, called a cookie, marks you as a Democrat or Republican, when you last voted, and what contributions you've made. It also can include factors like your estimated income, what you do for a living, and what you've bought at the local mall.Across the country, companies are using cookies to tailor the political ads you see online. One of the firms is CampaignGrid, which boasted in a recent slideshow, "Internet Users are No Longer Anonymous."Â The slideshow includes an image of the famous New Yorker cartoon from 1993: "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog." Next to it, CampaignGrid lists what it can now know about an Internet user: "Lives in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, 19002 zip code, Registered primary voting Republican, High net worth household, Age 50-54, Teenagers in the home, Technology professional, Interested in politics, Shopping for a car, Planning a vacation in Puerto Rico."The slideshow was online until last week, when the company removed it after we asked for comment. (Here is the full slideshow.) Rich Masterson, CampaignGrid's chairman, wrote in an email that the slideshow was posted in error: "It was an unapproved version of a sales deck that was posted by an intern who no longer works for the company."CampaignGrid does indeed collect 18 different "attributes" for every voter, Masterson told ProPublica, including age, gender, political donations, and more. Campaigns use this data to tailor the online ads you see.Online targeting has taken off this campaign season. ProPublica has identified seven companies that advertise the ability to help campaigns target specific voters online. Among them is Experian, the credit reporting company. Datalogix, a company that works with Facebook to track users' buying patterns, is also involved. (Here are marketing materials and comment from the seven companies). CampaignGrid and a few, similar firms have been profiled for their innovative approaches. Yet the scale of the targeting and the number of companies involved has received little notice.Few of the companies involved in the targeting talk about it publicly. But CampaignGrid, which works with Republicans, and a similar, Democratic firm, Precision Network, told ProPublica they have political information on 150 million American Internet users, or roughly 80 percent of the nation's registered voters.The information â€” stripped of your name or address â€” is connected to your computer via a cookie. Targeting firms say replacing your name with an ID number keeps the process anonymous and protects users' privacy.But privacy experts say that assembling information about Internet users' political behavior can be problematic even if voters' names aren't attached."A lot of people would consider their political identity more private than lots of information," said William McGeveran, a data privacy expert at the University of Minnesota Law School. "We make more rules about medical privacy. We make more rules about financial privacy. So if you think private political beliefs are in that category, maybe you're concerned about having them treated like your favorite brand of toothpaste."Google has stayed away from this kind of targeting. It classifies political beliefs as "sensitive personal information," in the same category as medical information and religious beliefs.But other big players have embraced the "political cookie," as one company branded it.As we reported in June, Yahoo and Microsoft sell access to your registration information for political targeting. That's one way CampaignGrid and other companies find you online. Political targeting firms say they also work with other websites, but would not name them.While campaigns and the firms working with them can buy reams of data about voters, voters have been left mostly in the dark.Many online ad companies mark targeted ads with a small blue triangle symbol, or the phrase "Ad Choices," and offer surfers a chance to opt out. But even if web users know what the triangle means, they get no information about how or why they were targeted."Consumers don't really understand what's going on and haven't given their permission," says Joseph Turow, a digital marketing and privacy expert at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication.There are few legal regulations governing how online targeting works, or what notification consumers must receive.Online advertising experts point out that individual voting records are public information and have long been used to target voters through direct mail. And targeting companies say they are offering a valuable service. Instead of seeing random ads, users get to see ads from candidates they might actually want to support."We empower voters," Jeff Dittus, co-founder of Campaign Grid and now head of Audience Partners, wrote in an email. "We give voters information that is meaningful to them and helps them make choices."Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for the Digital Advertising Alliance, an industry group, said that voter file targeting is a First Amendment issue, and that targeting should be protected as part of political speech."These technologies provide a method for politicians inexpensively to improve our democracy," he said. "I would say that the founding fathers firmly believed in the ability â€” I think our society very much values the ability â€” to efficiently reach a desired audience with a political message."Not everyone seems to agree. A recent study from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School found that 86 percent of surveyed adults did not want "political advertising tailored to your interests," and that 77 percent would not return to a website if they knew it "was sharing information about me with political advertisers."While targeting firms promise a wealth of individual detail, it's hard to know how much information most campaigns are actually using."The more third-party data providers you use, the smaller the universe of people who you can reach becomes," CampaignGrid's Masterson said. "Republican women 25-34 who drive SUVs and have American Express cards, and go to the theater once a month â€” that might be four people."One place online voter targeting has been used successfully is in the state senate primary race of Morgan McGarvey, a Kentucky Democrat who faced off against three other Democratic candidates this May.With four liberal candidates competing for a liberal district, McGarvey told ProPublica, he needed to convince the small number of voters who would turn out in the primary that they should vote for him.His campaign worked with Precision Network to show online McGarvey ads to local voters under 35, and to female Democrats who had voted in at least three of the past five primary elections. (Two of his challengers were women.)"When every dollar counts, when literally every vote counts, you have to be more targeted," he said."I do think it helped us win."McGarvey is now running unopposed in the November election.Have you seen a targeted political ad?Help us find out how politicians are targeting you online.1.

On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited's Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple's registered design No. 0000181607-0001. A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:"The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool."That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeal's judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.

The land in West Oakland where Eric Maundu is trying to farm is covered with freeways, roads, light rail and parking lots so there's not much arable land and the soil is contaminated. So Maundu doesn't use soil. Instead he's growing plants using fish and circulating water.It's called aquaponics- a gardening system that combines hydroponics (water-based planting) and aquaculture (fish farming). It's been hailed as the future of farming: it uses less water (up to 90% less than traditional gardening), doesn't attract soil-based bugs and produces two types of produce (both plants and fish).Aquaponics has become popular in recent years among urban gardeners and DIY tinkerers, but Maundu- who is trained in industrial robotics- has taken the agricultural craft one step further and made his gardens smart. Using sensors (to detect water level, pH and temperature), microprocessors (mostly the open-source Arduino microcontroller), relay cards, clouds and social media networks (Twitter and Facebook), Maundu has programmed his gardens to tweet when there's a problem (e.g. not enough water) or when there's news (e.g. an over-abundance of food to share).Maundu himself ran from agriculture in his native Kenya- where he saw it as a struggle for land, water and resources. This changed when he realized he could farm without soil and with little water via aquaponics and that he could apply his robotics background to farming. Today he runs Kijani Grows ("Kijani" is Swahili for green), a small startup that designs and sells custom aquaponics systems for growing food and attempts to explore new frontiers of computer-controlled gardening. Maundu believes that by putting gardens online, especially in places like West Oakland (where his solar-powered gardens are totally off the grid), it's the only way to make sure that farming remains viable to the next generation of urban youth.More info on original story: http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/internet-food-arduino-based-urban-aquapo...

TorrentFreak broke an unsurprising, but amazing, story this week in uncovering that Stroz Friedberg, the supposedly "independent and impartial tech expert" that was brought on to assist the Center for Copyright Information (CCI) in making sure that the new "six strikes" program BitTorrent monitoring is accurate, used to lobby for the RIAA. Apparently this bit of news took folks at CCI completely by surprise, since the RIAA failed to mention that tidbit of info. Now, CCI is apparently scrambling to make things right -- either by finding someone new, or by "opening up" the review that Stroz Friedberg does for the public to review. Either way, it's pretty incredible that the RIAA thought that no one would notice that the "impartial and independent" expert just happened to be a biased party that lobbied directly for them in the past.

The search and software giant says it has hit the new milestone for programs available for Android. By comparison, Microsoft has 120,000.Google has hit another milestone for Android apps, and this one is pretty big news for Apple too.The number of apps available for Android now totals about 700,000, a Google spokesman confirmed to CNET. That's up from the 675,000the company said it had a month ago.And it equals the figure Apple most recently touted. The Cupertino, Calif., company first revealed it had about 700,000 apps available in its store last month, and Apple reiterated that amount during the iPad Mini launch last week.The number of apps offered for an operating system is an important factor for driving user adoption. Apple had long led the rest of the market, but Google had been quickly catch up. By comparison, Microsoft said yesterday that it now has 120,000 apps for it Windows Phone OS. That's a pretty big figure for the company but it significantly lags Android and iOS.

There may be an app for almost everything, but there still isnâ€™t one for controlling Mother Nature.Google this morning officially canceled the Android event that was scheduled to occur on Monday, October 29 in New York City due to Hurricane Sandy, which is expected to hit the city on Sunday evening.In an email sent to reporters signed up to attend the event first picked up by Marketing Landâ€™s Danny Sullivan, Google issued a terse explanation:â€œWe are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more.â€?Weâ€™ve reached out to Google PR for more detail on when the event may be rescheduled, and will be sure to update this with anything we hear.The Android event was expected to compete for press attention with Microsoftâ€™s Windows Phone 8 launch also planned for Monday October 29th. That event is still on, though, as itâ€™s taking place in sunny San Francisco.

Apache has now backed down and provides the code to ignore DNT as a commented option in its config files.On Friday Yahoo! decided it was time to take over the resistance to DNT by announcing it would now ignore Internet Explorer 10 users' choices to not be tracked on grounds that it believes its users' experience is "better when it is personalized."There are several problems with their argument.The crux of the matter is whether Internet Explorer 10 is requiring users to choose a tracking preference. Considering the options presented during installation, this should be obvious.Yahoo! and other organizations that depend upon advertising revenue need to find a balance between targeted ads and respect for user privacy. If I log into their services I expect personalized weather, sports, stock and targeted advertising.If I simply click a link that leads to a Yahoo! asset, they should respect my choice, do not track, and present ads that may not be tailored, but still support Yahoo's valuable services.Every day I receive non-targeted ads in my physical mailbox.

What theyâ€™re doing on Marsden Farm isnâ€™t organic. Itâ€™s not industrial, either. Itâ€™s a hybrid of the two, an alternative version of agriculture for the 21st century: smart, green and powerful.On this farm in Boone County, Iowa, in the heart of corn country, researchers have borrowed from both approaches, using traditional techniques and modern chemicals to get industrial yields â€” but without industrial consequences.If the approach works at commercial scales, and thereâ€™s good reason to think it will, it might just be an answer to modern farmingâ€™s considerable problems.â€œWe wanted to show that small amounts of synthetic inputs are very powerful tools, but theyâ€™re tools with which you tune the system, not drive it,â€? said Adam Davis, a researcher with the United States Department of Agriculture.The Marsden Farm experiment, which is described in a study published Oct. 10 in Public Library of Science One, started in 2003, when Davis was a graduate student under agronomist Matt Liebman of Iowa State University. Liebmanâ€™s specialty is integrated pest management, or strategies that use nature to accomplish whatâ€™s typically done with pesticides, herbicides and synthetic fertilizer.Itâ€™s not a new idea, but itâ€™s one thatâ€™s been generally neglected for the last several decades, as large-scale farming came to rely on simplified, chemically intensive and ultimately unsustainable approaches. For a while, these worked, but with high yields came big problems: the threat of catastrophic disease outbreaks in monocultures, an insatiable demand for nitrogen fertilizer, pesticide-resistant bugs and herbicide-resistant superweeds, and a new generation of crops designed to be drenched in toxic chemicals.â€œWe have two choices now,â€? said Liebman. â€œWe can double down, load more chemicals into the system, and get another decade of increasingly ineffective control â€” or we can choose the path towards integrated management.â€?Liebman, inspired in part by a pioneering Iowa farmer named Dick Thompson, wanted to bring integrated pest management back, but augmented with technologyâ€™s new tools. On 22 acres at Marsden Farm, his team planted three plots with different rotations of crops. The first followed a two-year rotation, alternating between corn and soybeans, as is customary in the region. It was managed the usual way, with lots of chemicals.For the second plot, the researchers rotated over three years between corn, soy and oats, with red clover planted in winter. The clover, which absorbs atmospheric nitrogen, was planted between crop rows and plowed under as soil-replenishing â€œgreen manureâ€? in spring. On another plot, instead of red clover the researchers planted a fourth-year crop of alfalfa, which can be used to feed livestock. The animalsâ€™ manure came back as fertilizer.On these fields, the researchers still used herbicides and pesticides, but not the usual way. Rather than spraying them routinely over large areas, Liebmanâ€™s team applied them only when necessary. â€œWe use low-dose products in the smallest quantities possible,â€? he said. â€œWeâ€™re not against their use. What weâ€™re arguing for is using them as carefully deployed tactical options.â€?Liebman called these applications â€œtherapeutic measures.â€? Therapy wasnâ€™t often needed. Having different crops with different life cycles made it harder for weeds to grow. What might flourish among corn and soy, for example, was disrupted by oats. When red clover and alfalfa were mowed, weeds were chewed up before they flowered. As for insect problems, low pesticide use, along with habitat provided by cover crops, allowed pest-eating bugs and birds to flourish.After eight years, Liebman and Davis used eight times less herbicide in the three- and four-year rotations than in the conventional plot, they report in the new study. Ecotoxicity in surrounding water was two orders of magnitude lower. Thanks to clover and alfalfa, the experimental plots also used 86 percent less synthetic fertilizer.Most important of all, the experimental plots were as productive as the conventional. They produced just as much total crop biomass. When the researchers calculated the value of their environmentally friendly harvest, it was every bit as profitable.â€œWe exceeded those goals â€” not by pumping chemicals in, but by maximizing ecosystem services,â€? Davis said. â€œWeâ€™re not throwing away those tools. Theyâ€™re very important. But you use a strong cropping system as the foundation for your agriculture. Then, when you need it, you tweak it a little bit with the inputs.â€?Liebman and Davis said the system can be scaled up and applied to other crops. While the new studyâ€™s details were local, the essential underlying principle, of building a crop system around the ecological services it provides, is universal.â€œThis is a great study,â€? said John Reganold, a soil scientist at Washington State University who was not involved in the research. â€œWeâ€™ve been pushing the envelope on yields, and not paying as much attention to the environmental and social and economic consequences. This shows that these integrated systems can be profitable, produce high yields, and offer more environmental benefit.â€?In a paper published last year in Science, Reganold called for a transformation of U.S. agriculture along the lines seen at Marsden Farm. â€œTheyâ€™re almost like a blend of conventional and organic, using the best of both worlds,â€? he said. â€œItâ€™s these kinds of systems we need.â€?â€œTheir ideas point to the way that agriculture has to be in the future,â€? said agronomist Nicholas Jordan of the University of Minnesota. â€œThereâ€™s wide consensus that we have to figure out this fusion of â€˜organicâ€™ and â€˜industrial.â€™ Theyâ€™ve illustrated what that fusion looks like. Itâ€™s power and efficiency.â€?Jordan stressed that the Marsden Farm data was sound: No fudged numbers, no apples-and-oranges comparisons or subtle statistical slip-ups. Asked if the methods could scale commercially, Jordan said â€œthe answer is a resounding yes.â€?His enthusiasm was, however, tempered with caveats about challenges. Integrated pest management is much more complicated than industrial farming, requiring more day-to-day decisions and local knowledge. â€œWeâ€™ve become very, very used to a system thatâ€™s straightforward,â€? said crop scientist GermÃ¡n Bollero of the University of Illinois. â€œImplementing this at a large scale is not going to be easy.â€?Integrated pest management also requires more work. In the new study, the conventional method demanded one-third less labor than Liebman and Davisâ€™s fusion. â€œIt takes an energetic farmer, someone whoâ€™s investing a lot more of their own time, or potentially hiring added labor,â€? said agricultural economist Greg Graff of Colorado State University.These challenges should not be insurmountable. Locale-specific research will help with complexity. As for the additional labor, money that would have gone to chemicals can be used to hire workers. â€œI would argue that needing more labor in these systems means more jobs,â€? Reganold said. â€œIt will be good for the well-being of rural communities.â€?There are other advantages to the Marsden Farm method. As corn and soy production intensified in the midwest, field farmers often stopped raising livestock. These are now grown in concentrated animal feeding operations, which both incubate new disease and generate immense amounts of waste. If livestock again became part of local farming, as was required to consume the Marsden Farmâ€™s alfalfa, that waste would be fertilizer.Diverse, year-round crop rotations are also more resilient to climate stress. Weather patterns in the the midwestern United States are becoming more extreme, veering between the catastrophic floods of 2008 and 2010 and this summerâ€™s epic drought. Complex root systems prevent soil from washing away during spring rains, and store extra water against dry spells.â€œThese more diversified systems, the three- and four-year systems in the study, are less vulnerable to resource scarcities, climate change and market volatility,â€? said Reganold. â€œThese systems use less fertilizer and pesticides than the typical conventional system. Yes, this is environmentally beneficial, but it also has economic benefits because the price of fertilizers and pesticides will likely increase in the future.â€?If transforming agriculture seems an imposing task, Liebman said it can start small, with something as simple as weaving conservation strips into fields. It also doesnâ€™t need to happen immediately, in one radical step.â€œThe concept could be introduced by encouraging farmers to continue farming in the traditional way, but little by little introduce diversity. There could be tax benefit or subsidy for introducing things like cover crops,â€? Bollero said. â€œIf those signals are there, youâ€™ll see a lot of farmers adopting this.â€?Graff noted that farm subsidies currently favor intensive soy and corn production, and that industry lobbying groups have actively resisted subsidy reform that rewards other types of crop production. Ultimately, however, this is an issue that citizens can decide.â€œA very large amount of taxpayer money is channeled through the federal government into the farming sector. In Iowa, itâ€™s something like $1 billion of your money,â€? Liebman said. â€œIf you can get cleaner water, less exposure to pesticide, and more wildlife habitat, if farmers can maintain their revenue streams and work in a healthier world â€” why wouldnâ€™t you do that?â€?

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It's gadget season, and Google wants in on all the fun that Microsoft and Apple have been having.Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) unveiled a new "Nexus" phone, tablet and Android operating system on Monday. Its goal is wrest back some of the attention that Windows 8, Surface, the iPad, iPad miniand iPhone 5 have gotten over the past several weeks.The Nexus 4 is the fourth annual "Google phone," designed by the search giant and manufactured by one of its Android partners -- this time, LG. Google didn't say much about the device, other than that it has the latest quad-core mobile processor (that's fast), and a 4.7-inch screen (really big).Google's Nexus phones have never sold particularly well, but this time around Google is trying something bold. For $299, customers can buy a Nexus 4 without a two-year contract. That's quite cheap for an "unlocked" high-end smartphone. An unlocked iPhone 5, by comparison, costs $650.The base model Nexus 4 comes with 8 gigabytes of storage, half the typical amount for a smartphone. A 16 GB phone is available for $349. Both will go on sale on Nov. 13 online at the Google Play store. T-Mobile customers can also get a 16 GB version with a two-year contract for $199.The Nexus also works on AT&T (T, Fortune 500), which uses a similar network technology, but it isn't compatible with Verizon's network or Sprint's, according to a Google spokesman.The search leader also announced a new 10-inch tablet, dubbed the Nexus 10. With 300 pixels per inch, the Samsung device has the highest-resolution screen for any tablet, Google claims, including the iPad with Apple's Retina display. Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) says the iPad sports a 264-pixels-per-inch screen.The Nexus 10 allows for multiple user accounts, so that a family can share the device and keep separate apps and settings for each user. It also has stereo speakers and a standard tablet battery that lasts for nine hours.The price tag is competitive: The 16 GB version will go on sale on the Google Play store Nov. 13 for $399, and a 32 GB version will be available for $499. Comparable iPads are each $100 more expensive.Google also unveiled an update to its Nexus 7 tablet, which the company unveiled in June. A new 32 GB version of the seven-inch Asus device is now available with AT&T's 3G-HSPA+ service -- which AT&T brands as "4G" -- for $299."We think today's devices offer the very best that money can buy," Android chief Andy Rubin said in a blog post.The Android software that runs Google's devices also got a minor update on Monday. New features include Photo Sphere, a 360-degree photo-taking app and wireless streaming support for Qualcomm's (QCOM, Fortune 500) Miracast wireless displays. It also offers a keyboard that doesn't require typing: "Gesture Typing" lets users glide their fingers over the letters they want to type.Google Now, an app that surfaces important information from e-mail, calendars and social networks, added support for flight information notifications, restaurant reservations, hotel confirmations and shipping details, in addition to nearby attractions like movies times at local theaters.A launch event had been planned in New York, but it was canceled due to Hurricane Sandy. Google announced the devices in a blog post instead.Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) will be holding a Windows Phone 8 launch event in San Francisco on Monday.

The European Union will spend approximately $900 million on a project to build the world's most intense, powerful laser beam in order to eviscerate nuclear waste and possibly provide new cancer treatments as well.TheÂ EXTREME LIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE project (ELI)Â involves nearly 40 research and academic institutions from 13 different states within the European Unioin.ELI's coordinator at its Romanian facility, Nicolae-Victor Zamfir, told Bloomberg that the lasers are "10 times more powerful than any yet built and will be strong enough to create subatomic particles in a vacuum, similar to conditions that may have followed the start of the universe."Â "Eventually," according to Zamfir, "the power of the light beams could be used to deteriorate the radioactivity of nuclear waste in just a few seconds and target cancerous tumors."The cancer treatment would be similar to a current experiential process known as hadron therapy.Â The therapy is particularlyÂ effective in targeting cancers located in areas "which are inaccessible to the surgeon's instruments or which are hard to treat by radiotherapy," like brain tumors, those in areas close to the spinal cord, or inside the eye.There will be four separate sites throughout Europe that make up the facility when it is completed: the one in Romania, another in Hungary, a third in the Czech Republic, and a fourth in a location that has yet to be named (but will be by the end of 2012).The laser is expected to become operational in 2017.See the most energetic laser beam ever created >

MENLO PARK, Calif. â€” Many people cite Albert Einsteinâ€™s aphorism â€œEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.â€? Only a handful, however, have had the opportunity to discuss the concept with the physicist over breakfast.One of those is Peter G. Neumann, now an 80-year-old computer scientist at SRI International, a pioneering engineering research laboratory here.As an applied-mathematics student at Harvard, Dr. Neumann had a two-hour breakfast with Einstein on Nov. 8, 1952. What the young math student took away was a deeply held philosophy of design that has remained with him for six decades and has been his governing principle of computing and computer security.For many of those years, Dr. Neumann (pronounced NOY-man) has remained a voice in the wilderness, tirelessly pointing out that the computer industry has a penchant for repeating the mistakes of the past. He has long been one of the nationâ€™s leading specialists in computer security, and early on he predicted that the security flaws that have accompanied the pell-mell explosion of the computer and Internet industries would have disastrous consequences.â€œHis biggest contribution is to stress the â€˜systemsâ€™ nature of the security and reliability problems,â€? said Steven M. Bellovin, chief technology officer of the Federal Trade Commission. â€œThat is, trouble occurs not because of one failure, but because of the way many different pieces interact.â€?Dr. Bellovin said that it was Dr. Neumann who originally gave him the insight that â€œcomplex systems break in complex waysâ€? â€” that the increasing complexity of modern hardware and software has made it virtually impossible to identify the flaws and vulnerabilities in computer systems and ensure that they are secure and trustworthy.The consequence has come to pass in the form of an epidemic of computer malware and rising concerns about cyberwarfare as a threat to global security, voiced alarmingly this month by the defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, who warned of a possible â€œcyber-Pearl Harborâ€? attack on the United States.It is remarkable, then, that years after most of his contemporaries have retired, Dr. Neumann is still at it and has seized the opportunity to start over and redesign computers and software from a â€œclean slate.â€?He is leading a team of researchers in an effort to completely rethink how to make computers and networks secure, in a five-year project financed by the Pentagonâ€™s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, with Robert N. Watson, a computer security researcher at Cambridge Universityâ€™s Computer Laboratory.â€œIâ€™ve been tilting at the same windmills for basically 40 years,â€? said Dr. Neumann recently during a lunchtime interview at a Chinese restaurant near his art-filled home in Palo Alto, Calif. â€œAnd I get the impression that most of the folks who are responsible donâ€™t want to hear about complexity. They are interested in quick and dirty solutions.â€?Dr. Neumann, who left Bell Labs and moved to California as a single father with three young children in 1970, has occupied the same office at SRI for four decades. Until the building was recently modified to make it earthquake-resistant, the office had attained notoriety for the towering stacks of computer science literature that filled every cranny. Legend has it that colleagues who visited the office after the 1989 earthquake were stunned to discover that while other offices were in disarray from the 7.1-magnitude quake, nothing in Dr. Neumannâ€™s office appeared to have been disturbed.A trim and agile man, with piercing eyes and a salt-and-pepper beard, Dr. Neumann has practiced tai chi for decades. But his passion, besides computer security, is music. He plays a variety of instruments, including bassoon, French horn, trombone and piano, and is active in a variety of musical groups. At computer security conferences it has become a tradition for Dr. Neumann to lead his colleagues in song, playing tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan and Tom Lehrer.Until recently, security was a backwater in the world of computing. Today it is a multibillion-dollar industry, though one of dubious competence, and safeguarding the nationâ€™s computerized critical infrastructure has taken on added urgency. President Obama cited it in the third debate of the presidential campaign, focusing on foreign policy, as something â€œwe need to be thinking aboutâ€? as part of the nationâ€™s military strategy.

The iPad mini has been rumored for nearly as long as the original iPad has existed, but it wasn't clear early on how many of those rumors were based on fact and how many were based on hope. Hope, that was, for a smaller, more portable tablet that would bring access to all the Apple ecosystem had to offer, in a package you could easily hold in one hand. Specifically, a package more affordable than the 10-incher.That's this, the 7.9-inch, $329 iPad mini that sports a screen with the same resolution as the iPad 2 -- only smaller. As we put this one through its paces it quickly became clear that this is far more than a cheaper, smaller iPad. This is a thinner, lighter device that deserves independent consideration. In many ways, it's actually better than the 10-inch slate from which it was born. But is it better for you? Join us after the break as we find out.Apple wanted to be very clear at its product-packed iPad mini launch event that this isn't just a shrunken-down iPad. And, indeed, that starts with a very different case design. While the second, third and fourth generations of iPads have all been more or less indistinguishable, the iPad mini's anodized aluminum back looks entirely different. In fact, the whole thing looks a lot more like a blown-up fifth-generation iPod touch than a shrunken-down fourth-generation iPad.The profile itself is more rounded than the full-size iPad, lacking the sharp taper at the edges. This, we presume, gives a little more room for the battery inside, but it also makes this a more comfortable slate to carry around. The edges on the 10-inch iPad can cut into your hand if you're the sort who carries yours wherever you go. Not so with the mini.Of course, that's helped greatly by the decrease in weight here. The WiFi-only iPad mini weighs just 0.68 pounds (308 grams), which is less than half the weight of the fourth-generation iPad. It's far thinner, too, at 7.2mm (vs. 9.4) and measures 7.87 x 5.3 inches (200 x 135mm) on the other dimensions. Inside that plane is a 7.9-inch, 1,024 x 768 IPS LCD which has significantly smaller bezels than those found in other iPads. It's thanks to those bezels that a display this size can be housed in a slate this size, but still that 5.3-inch horizontal span may be a bit of a problem for some.To us, the joy of a 7-inch tablet is walking across the office or the airport, holding the slate in one hand while tapping away at it with the other. The Nexus 7, with its 16:9 aspect ratio, is relatively narrow and easy to carry securely one-handed -- even by those whose mittens are size S. With the iPad mini, holding the slate in the same way can be a bit of a reach. This editor, who wears XL gloves, had no problem palming the littler iPad, but when we handed it to other, dainty-fingered people they sometimes struggled to hold it securely.The scrawny bezels on either side actually exacerbate this issue to some degree, as those who must loop a thumb around the front of the device when holding it are forced to put that thumb right on the display. Thankfully, every app we tried handled this situation without issue, Kindle and iBooks turning pages and acting normally even with that stray opposable member making square contact on the digitizer.Overall, the tablet is very comfortable to hold; its thinness and lightness are both attributes that must be perceived first-hand. That 7.2mm depth is exactly the same as the fourth-generation iPod touch, which even today is an impressively svelte device. We reviewed the black model, which features a dark bezel and anodized back to match. It's cool and matte to the touch, which we find very appealing, but time will tell just how durable this black version will prove. Those who are scratch-averse may want to think about the white and silver variety, which will likely hide those markings a bit better.The layout of the buttons is familiar, but different. The volume rocker and orientation lock switches are on the upper portion of the right side, but here up and down are distinct buttons, not like the integrated rocker on the full-size iPad. It's also not like the three-way rocker found on the latest iPod nano, which features an integrated play/pause button. That's a bit unfortunate, as we'd like to see that find its way across the product line, but perhaps it will in future revisions. (Yes, we're expecting more.)The power button is up top, looking and feeling very much like those on older iPads. There's a small slit for a microphone up there as well, and on the other side, the 3.5mm headphone jack, which bucks the trend of bottom-placement found on nearly every other Apple mobile device. On the left side of the device nothing, and on the bottom is where the Lightning connector lives. Like the iPhone 5, that connector is flanked by two sets of two rows of holes, drilled to let the device's sound out. It's reasonably loud and, since it's on the bottom not the back, the sound is closer to traveling in the right direction to meet your ears, but it's still a less than ideal listening experience. You'll want a set of headphones -- which, as with other iPads, are not included.The only other button is on the front, a smaller version of the same Home button found on the iPad. Curiously, it's even smaller than the button on the iPhone, making it very petite indeed. Around back, there's just one detail to concern yourself with: the lens assembly for the 5-megapixel iSight camera stuffed in the upper-left. That's paired with a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD center-cut in the bezel atop the LCD.No, this isn't Retina, but maintaining the same resolution as a 10-inch display shrunken down to 7.9 means a necessary boost in pixel density: 163ppi. That's a nice increase over the iPad 2's 132ppi, but it still falls short of the 264ppi of the fourth-generation iPad -- not to mention, the iPhone 5's 326dpi. Naturally, this means that text isn't anywhere near as sharp as on the newer iPads, but this is still a very nice-looking display.In fact we found the brightness and color reproduction to be improved over the iPad 2, comparable to the latest Retina displays. Colors are very pleasing to the eye and viewing angles, as ever with an Apple display, do not disappoint. You can line up as many friends as you like and sit them shoulder-to-shoulder, they'll all have a bright, clear picture. Yes, mini owners may have to make do with some resolution envy, but they at least won't be lacking in any other regard.The iPad mini is running a dual-core 1GHz CPU with 512MB of RAM, same as in the iPad 2 and as such it throws down the same benchmark scores and overall performance figures. Geekbench averages out at 751 and GLBench shows 24fps on the 2.5 Egypt HD benchmark. The SunSpider JavaScript benchmark completes in 1,426ms.These numbers pale in comparison to the new, fourth-gen iPad but we think that in day-to-day usage the relative lack of performance won't be as noticeable. Apps do load more slowly but most are still up and running within a second or two and when it comes to general web surfing tasks the iPad mini easily kept up with our taps and swipes. So, perhaps not the greatest performance in the Apple lineup, but there is one place where it bests the rest: battery life.In our standard battery run-down test, which entails looping a video with WiFi enabled and a fixed display brightness, the iPad mini managed an astounding 12 hours and 43 minutes. This gives it the longest battery life of any tablet we've ever tested, besting even the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 by 42 minutes. Indeed during the course of our testing the battery on the iPad mini exceeded our expectations, expectations that were already high thanks to the consistently great battery life offered by the iPad family.The iPad 2 never saw HDR nor the Panorama mode that wowed us so on the iPhone 5, and neither does the iPad mini. It does, however, have a better camera than the iPad 2, a 5-megapixel shooter with an f/2.4 lens, and a 1.2-megapixel Facetime HD camera up front. The one 'round back appears to be the same camera module used on the iPhone 4 and as such, it takes good quality images. No, they don't quite pop like the 8-megapixel shooter on the iPhone 5, nor does this tablet manage low-light shooting as well as Apple's latest round of CPUs, but in our opinion tablets should only be used to take pictures in a pinch, and as such the iPad mini does just fine.It also takes reasonably good video, shooting at 1080p like all the latest Apple devices. But again, the combination of a lower-res sensor and the lack of a newer image processing chip means image stabilization isn't nearly as good here as on the iPhone 5. So, you'll want to hold steady while shooting, but remember to do so in a place with enough ambient light; do that and you'll get yourself some quality footage.You can't tally up any iPad's chances in the market without comparing it against all the other iPads in the market, and so we'll start by comparing the mini to its siblings, of which there are two at present. First is the iPad 2, available only in 16GB sizes either WiFi-only or a 3G model, each priced $70 more than the same-sized mini. For that $70 more you get a bigger screen and lower-resolution cameras front and back. For us, this is a no-brainer. Get the mini. Unless you suffer from ailing eyesight and need a larger portal into the iOS world, the smaller device is far and away the better one.The choice between this and the new fourth-generation iPad is a bit more challenging. It's a considerably more expensive device, starting at $499, and of course a bigger and heavier one, too. Still, battery life on that guy is impressively good (over 11 hours) and the performance is stellar -- living up to and exceeding Apple's "2x faster" claims. Still, speed isn't everything and while we love that big, Retina display we're not entirely sure that we prefer it to the tiny, lightweight form factor of the mini. In fact, we found ourselves enjoying the portability of the mini so much that we'd probably give that one the nod, but this decision will almost certainly come down to personal preference. So, if you can, head to an Apple Store and try out both.Moving outside of the ecosystem, most people are comparing the iPad mini to the Nexus 7. To some degree that's a natural comparison, as this is Apple's cheapest tablet compared to Google's low-cost device. In practice, these are very different devices, starting with the cost: $199 for a 16GB Nexus 7 vs. $329 for the iPad. The designs are strikingly different, too, with the Nexus having a high-quality but somewhat discount feel versus the overwhelmingly high-end iPad mini. In no way does Apple's latest feel like a tablet that was made to a budget. It simply feels like an Apple device.And, of course, it gives access to Apple's ecosystem of hundreds of thousands of tablet-friendly apps -- plus all the media iTunes has to offer. We can't help you decide which ecosystem, Apple or Google's, is better-suited to your interests, but we do imagine that will be the deciding factor for most. When it comes down to hardware, it's almost no contest between the two, with the iPad mini clearly winning out -- except in one area. That's the display. The Nexus 7 has a higher-resolution panel that's also 16:9, making it better for movie watching. It's also narrower, and thus easier to hold in your hand.We'd also be remiss if we didn't at least mention the $199 Kindle Fire HD. Amazon's latest also offers a higher-resolution, IPS LCD and has the extra selling point of stereo speakers. It also has a strong suite of content, courtesy of Amazon's many partnerships, but overall we have a hard time comparing these two. Amazon's device is clearly a cut-rate slate designed to push as much digital buying power into the hands of consumers as possible, while Apple's is simply a legitimately nice tablet. It's a legitimately nice tablet that Apple certainly would love for you to fill with premium content downloaded through iTunes, but it never feels like a shopping portal. The Kindle does.Surely, the most popular accessory for the iPad mini will be the new Smart Cover that, despite being both smaller and of considerably simpler construction, still costs the same $39 as the bigger, 10-inch version. That's a little unfortunate, especially because we don't think this version works as well. There is one positive change: the smaller Smart Cover moves away from the aluminum hinge on the bigger version, a good thing because we've seen plenty of scratches caused by that metal-on-metal contact.It's still attached magnetically, but where the 10-inch model will immediately snap into the perfect placement every time, we found the mini cover just as eager to attach either too high or too low. It requires a little more precision. Hardly a deal-breaker (how often are you removing your Smart Cover?) but a bit of an annoyance.The other accessories, and there are plenty of them, all make use of the device's Lightning connector, many existing only to add a little more life to your various iPod docks and chargers. The stubby 30-pin to Lightning adapter is $29, the same cost as the two camera adapters: one USB and one SD. (This is a change from the 30-pin Camera Connection Kit, which included both for $29.) The Lightning to 30-pin adapter (which includes a 0.2 meter cable in the middle) costs $39 and, finally, both the VGA and digital AV adapters are $49. Like the previous Digital AV adapter (which was $39), this one includes HDMI output and has an input so that you can still charge the tablet while it's in use. Handy for those digital signage applications -- or getting in one final, epic Lord of the Rings marathon before December.This isn't just an Apple tablet made to a budget. This isn't just a shrunken-down iPad. This is, in many ways, Apple's best tablet yet, an incredibly thin, remarkably light, obviously well-constructed device that offers phenomenal battery life. No, the performance doesn't match Apple's latest and yes, that display is a little lacking in resolution, but nothing else here will leave you wanting. At $329, this has a lot to offer over even Apple's more expensive tablets.Those comparing this to the Kindle Fire HD will have a hard time, as that's a tablet manufactured to a fixed cost and designed to sell you content. This is very much more. Similarly, the hardware here -- the materials, the lightness, the build quality, the overall package as it sits in your hand -- is much nicer than the Nexus 7 and it offers access to the comprehensively more tablet-friendly App Store, but whether that's worth the extra cost depends entirely on the size of your budget -- and your proclivity toward Android.Regardless, the iPad mini is well worth considering for anybody currently in the market for a tablet. Its cost is compelling, its design superb and it of course gives access to the best selection of tablet-optimized apps on the market. To consider it just a cheap, tiny iPad is a disservice. This is, simply, a great tablet.Update: This review originally stated (as does Apple's spec page) that the iPad mini has a mono speaker. It is, in fact, a stereo device.[Last photo by Will Lipman]

When you buy a USB charger, how do you know if you're getting a safe, high-quality charger for your money? You can't tell from the outside if a charger provides silky-smooth power or if it is a dangerous charger that emits noisy power that cause touchscreen malfunctions[1] and could self-destruct. In this article, I carefully measure the performance of a dozen different chargers, rate their performance in multiple categories, and determine the winners and losers.Inside a chargerThese chargers cram a lot of complex circuitry into a small package, as you can see from the iPhone charger below. (See my iPhone charger teardown for more details.) The small size makes it challenging to make an efficient, high-quality charger, while the commoditization of chargers and the demand for low prices pressure manufacturers to make the circuit as simple as possible and exclude expensive components, even if the power quality is worse. The result is a wide variation in the quality of the chargers, most of which is invisible to the user, who may believe "a charger is a charger".Internally a charger is an amazingly compact switching power supply that efficiently converts line AC into 5 volt DC output. The input AC is first converted to high-voltage DC. The DC is chopped up tens of thousands of times a second and fed into a tiny flyback transformer. The output of the transformer is converted to low-voltage DC, filtered, and provided as the 5 volt output through the USB port. A feedback mechanism regulates the chopping frequency to keep the output voltage stable. Name-brand chargers use a specialized control IC to run the charger, while cheap chargers cut corners by replacing the IC with a cheap, low-quality feedback circuit.[4]A poor design can suffer several problems. If the output voltage is not filtered well, there will be noise and spikes due to the high-frequency switching. At extreme levels this could damage your phone, but the most common symptom is the touchscreen doesn't work while the charger is plugged in.[1] A second problem is the output voltage can be affected by the AC input, causing 120 Hz "ripple".[5] Third, the charger is supposed to provide a constant voltage. A poor design can cause the voltage to sag as the load increases. Your phone will take longer to charge if the charger doesn't provide enough power. Finally, USB chargers are not all interchangeable; the wrong type of charger may not work with your device.[6]CounterfeitsCounterfeit chargers pose a safety hazard as well as a hazard to your phone. You can buy a charger that looks just like an Apple charger for about $2, but the charger is nothing like an Apple charger internally. The power is extremely bad quality (as I will show below). But more importantly, these chargers ignore safety standards. Since chargers have hundreds of volts internally, there's a big risk if a charger doesn't have proper insulation. You're putting your phone, and more importantly yourself, at risk if you use one of these chargers. I did a teardown of a counterfeit charger, which shows the differences in detail.I've taken apart several counterfeit chargers and readers have sent me photos of others. Surprisingly, the counterfeit chargers I've examined all use different circuitry internally. If you get a counterfeit, it could be worse or better than what I've seen.How do you tell if a charger is counterfeit? The fakes are very similar; it's hard for me to tell, even after studying many chargers. There's a video on how to distinguish real and fake chargers through subtle differences. You can also weigh the charger (if you have an accurate scale), and compare with the weights I give above. The easiest way to get a genuine Apple charger is fork over $29 to an Apple store. If you buy a $2 "Original Genuine Apple" charger on eBay shipped from China, I can guarantee it's counterfeit. On the other hand, I've succeeded in buying genuine used chargers from US resellers for a moderate price on eBay, but you're taking a chance.The following picture shows a counterfeit charger that burned up. The safety issues with counterfeits are not just theoretical; when hundreds of volts short out, the results can be spectacular.A device being charged can detect what type of charger is being used through specific voltages on the USB data pins.[6] Because of this, some devices only work with their own special chargers. For instance, an "incorrect" charger may be rejected by an iPhone 3GS or later with the message "Charging is not supported with this accessory".[7]There are many different charger types, but only a few are used in the chargers I examined. A USB charger that follows the standard is known as a "dedicated USB charger". However, some manufacturers (such as Apple, Sony, and HP) don't follow the USB standard but implement their own proprietary charger types. Apple has separate charger types for 1 amp (iPhone) and 2 amp (iPad) chargers. HP has a special type for the HP TouchPad.The point is that USB chargers are not interchangeable, and devices may not work if the charger type doesn't match what the device expects. The table below shows the type of charger, the current that the label claims the charger provides, the current it actually provides, and the charger type it indicates to the device.The types of the counterfeit chargers are a mess, as they advertise one power level, actually supply a different power level, and have the charger type for a third level. For example, the counterfeit iPhone charger is advertised as supplying 1 amp, but has the 2A charger type, so an iPad will expect 2 amps but not obtain enough power. On the other hand, the counterfeit iPad charger claims to supply 2 amps, but really only supplies 1 amp and has a 1A type.People often wonder how much power their charger is wasting while it's idle, and if they should unplug their charger when not in use. I measured this "vampire" power usage and found the chargers varied by more than a factor of 20 in their idle power usage. The Samsung oblong charger came in best, using just 19 mW; this was so low compared to the other chargers that I measured it again a different way to make sure I hadn't made an error. On the other extreme, the fake iPhone charger used 375 mW. The Apple iPhone charger performed surprisingly badly at 195 mW. If plugged in for a year, this would cost you about 21 cents in electricity, so it's probably not worth worrying about.[8] In the following table, I use the official charger Star Rating System (yes, there actually is such a thing).[9][10]I also measured efficiency of the chargers under load.[11] One of the benefits of switching power supplies over simpler linear supplies is they are much more efficient at converting the input power to output. The chargers I measured all did pretty well, with 63% to 80% efficiency. The HP charger was the winner here.

I'm proud to announce an upcoming private beta of sex.ly! sex.ly is a new web and mobile app aimed at bringing Social to Sex. It's based around the idea that sexual intercourse itself should be more social, more open, and more fun.To that end, sex.ly will feature the following:â€” Check-in to sexual encounters. You'll now never forget a night. Describe positions, durations, sounds.â€” If (and only if) your partner(s) agrees, you can rate and review them. If they don't, you still can review them as anonymous partners.â€” Give a heads-up (pun intended) warning to other potential mates. Make sure dysfunction is kept out of your life.â€” Earn sex-cred for number of check-ins, which can be used at sex stores and other selected merchants.â€” Geo-tag sexual encounters! Support for in-airplane geo-tags is coming soon.sex.ly is of course not real. And yet, each day, I become more and more convinced that we really are not that far from it.You were repulsed by the above description of this imaginary site. But not because of some prudish reasons, not even because it had to do with sex. No. You were repulsed because sex.ly violates something very deep and fundamental about humanity. But what, in particular?I doubt that it's some old-fashioned 'don't kiss and tell' shit. After all, we have plenty of sex writers in the world, all describing their sex lives in detail, and we don't hate that. Nor do I think it is even the egoism of the whole thing.No. What is truly horrifying about sex.ly is that it so utterly and absolutely cheapens the experience of something very important. It bundles it all up into some packaged product of check-ins and ratings and de-humanizing rankings. It turns us into commercial broadcasters of the meaningful parts of our lives.And yet one can almost already hear it: "It's not really sex until it's on sex.ly."Now my description of sex.ly is obviously an intuition pump. I want you to hate it â€” because, with only slight exaggeration, this is how I feel about almost all life-casting.We have begun to pollute and desecrate and cheapen all of our experiences. We are creating neat little life-boxes for everything, all tied up with a geo-tag, a photo, a check-in; our daily existence transformed into database entries in some NoSQL database on some spinning disk in some rack in suburban Virginia.The end-game is this. Slowly, gradually, without realizing: we stop participating in our own lives. We become spectators, checking off life achievements for reasons we do not know. At some point, everything we do is done soley to broadcast these things to casual friends, stalkers, and sycophants.Philip Larkin, writing about the destruction of the English countryside, once said that most things are never meant. That may be true here too. Maybe things won't get so bad.But as I watch us fall further and further into packaged lives, I can't escape hearing Larkin's conclusion to that poem: I just think it will happen, soon.

New York - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) urged a federal appeals court Friday not to shut down Aereo, a startup that lets customers send local broadcast television to Internet-connected devices, arguing that consumers have the right to watch free broadcast TV with the technology of their choice.Broadcasters and TV networks â€“ including ABC, Fox, Univision, Disney, CBS, NBC, and PBS â€“ sued Aereo for copyright infringement in March, claiming that Aereo should be paying them license fees. The trial court declined to shut Aereo down during the lawsuit, and the broadcasters appealed. Now, the appeals court will decide whether Aereo can stay open while the case goes forward. EFF, along with Public Knowledge and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), filed a friend of the court brief Friday, asking the appeals court to reject the networks' bogus copyright claims and protect the rights of consumers."Just because Aereo's system sends TV signals to customers doesn't mean that Aereo needs permission from the broadcasters," said EFF Staff Attorney Mitch Stoltz. "Personal TV transmissions don't violate copyright â€“ it's a private use that copyright law doesn't reach. This is just a craven attempt by TV executives to profit from technology that they didn't think of first."Aereo's system works with thousands of dime-sized antennas installed on a Brooklyn rooftop. Each customer is assigned a single antenna that he or she can control, and the signal from that antenna travels over the Internet to the customer's devices. Aereo has explained in court that it simply takes the place of "rabbit ears" or a rooftop antenna, but the networks argued that Aereo should be treated like a cable system that must get permission from and pay fees to broadcasters.In deciding not to shut Aereo down pending trial, Judge Alison Nathan of the Southern District of New York said that Aereo's system was similar to another technology that survived a court challenge: Cablevision's "remote DVR" system, which in 2008 was found not to infringe copyright law. Like Aereo, Cablevision took equipment that customers traditionally put in their homes â€“ in that case, digital video recorders â€“ and moved them to the company's offices. Judge Nathan ruled that the appeals court's decision in the Cablevision case also applied to Aereo."Broadcasters have exclusive use of a scarce public resource â€“ the airwaves â€“ and that privilege carries with it a responsibility to serve the public. Obviously, the public benefits by having alternative ways to enjoy TV content," said EFF Intellectual Property Director Corynne McSherry. "Judge Nathan reached the right result and we hope the appeals court does too."EFF co-wrote its brief with John Bergmayer and Sherwin Siy of Public Knowledge.

We've written before about Google's investments in a wide range of green energy companies, including wind, solar, and geothermal plants. At this week's annual shareholder's meeting, CEO Larry Page announced a new R&D team charged with capitalizing on those investments and Google's own cleantech intellectual property. These moves suggest the search and software giant is ramping up its efforts to develop its own clean technology in conjunction with its partners to bring that energy to market at efficiency and scale.Google's energy investments have always been complicated, spread between philanthropy and business, trying to be responsible to both shareholders and the planet. On one hand, Google wants to take the long view, identifying genuinely transformative possibilities in energy generation and transmission and securing its own high-energy-needs future. On the other hand, the company is looking for places where it can make an immediate technological impact and generate a solid return on its investment."We spend most of our time on search and advertising," Page said, but "to people outside the company, what's more interesting is 'what is the latest crazy thing that Google did?'""For us, those things are interesting, too, but it tends to be three people somewhere in the company," he noted. "We're not betting the farm on any of those things." In the case of renewable energy, Google's new hires seem to indicate it will be five people somewhere in the company, but their work is more serious than just engineers fiddling in a lab looking for "the latest crazy thing." In other words, it isn't like a driverless car that may or may not appear in the indefinite future, but a serious industry that Google's approaching with urgency.The ultimate goal is eminently practical: "RE < C," Google's long-established project to make renewable energy cheaper than coal. The urgency comes in the addendum to that formula: "Within a few years."To that end, Google has advertised five new positions in its Renewable Energy Engineering wing in Mountain View. One will be charged with managing Google's own energy usage to help keep the company cost-efficient and carbon-neutral. The other four spots are much more mechanical-engineering heavy than the typical Google hires. These are more interesting.The three-person renewable energy engineering team will be responsible for both evaluating and recommending investments for the company and in developing new technologies. There's a head of renewable energy engineering to lead the team, an engineer specializing in early-stage technology and prototyping, and a mechanical engineer who heads up design and manufacturing.The key phrase throughout the advertised positions is "utility-scale." The language of the mechanical engineer advertisement is especially revealing: "You will not be designing laboratory experiments; you will be designing useful systems that must deliver cost-effective results in the real world." This isn't pie-in-the-sky R&D. This is about products.I asked Google spokesperson Parag Chokshi if it would be fair to say that Google may soon be playing a more active role with its clean energy partners than just capital support. "We haven't changed our strategy," Chokshi said, while noting that Google doesn't typically comment on the specifics of its hiring strategy. "In fact, we have and continue to work closely with our partners... [both] the renewable energy projects in which we have invested, and with the co-investors who have joined us in investing in those projects."In April, Rick Needham, Google's Director of Green Business Operations and Strategy, toldFast Companythat Google's energy approach was both investment- and technology-driven: "We want to have an impact on the scale of the project, and an impact because of the technology being deployed." Large-scale projects are "the proof point of technology on a scale that allows those technologies to be financed and deployed at other locations."As new CEO, Larry Page is under pressure to deliver something big. Recently, Malcolm Gladwell argued (in his typically contrarian fashion) that the Internet "search solves problems that aren't really problems":Can we make a better Google or Bing? Yeah; sure we can. But it solves a problem that isn't really a problem. You cannot point to any area of intellectual activity or innovation that is today being compromised or hamstrung by their lack of access to search technology. Can we honestly go to some scientist to say that the reason you haven't cured cancer is because you don't have access to some information about cancer research? No!There isn't a problem that's any bigger or more real than generating renewable energy and bringing it to market. If Google can find big ways in just the next few years to solve only a part of that puzzle, turning Google's energy wing into a business remotely as robust as its search and software core, then Page will have delivered something big indeed.

Go ahead, jailbreak your cellphone. But just know that tablet computer of yours is off limits.The U.S. Copyright Office published a document on Oct. 26, specifying that while jailbreaking a smartphone is deemed legal, the same rules do not apply to gaming consoles or tablets like Apple's iPad or the Microsoft Surface.According to CNET, the Copyright Office accepts requests every three years from "digital rights proponents and opponents" to alter laws under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This legislation was passed in 1998 and, fittingly, was put into effect in 2000. The American Library Associationdefines the act as a way for "U.S. copyright law to meet the demands of the Digital Age." In short, amendments to this act change the legality of practices like jailbreaking, or unlocking, your gadgets.The updated document (seen here) states the following:So which organizations wanted consumers to legally be allowed to jailbreak their devices? The legal papers show that the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), New America Foundationâ€™s Open Technology Initiative, New Media Rights, Mozilla Corporation and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) were all proponents.The Copyright Office cites several reasons as to why cellphones can legally undergo the process of jailbreaking, while other devices are excluded from this freedom. Explanations are provided below:Still, how long will many of these laws be applicable? For example, the idea that smartphones are more widely adapted than tablets could be an outdated concept by 2015. Either way, the updated copyright laws will be implemented on Oct. 28, 2012 and remain in effect for three years.What are your thoughts on the Copyright Office's amendments?

Apple (AAPL) customers are famed for their loyalty, but it looks as though some of them may not be as fanatical as theyâ€™ve been in the past. New data from Strategy Analytics shows that 75% of iPhone owners in Western Europe said they would buy an Apple device for their next smartphone, versus 88% who said theyâ€™d buy an iPhone for their next device last year. iPhone user loyalty also dipped slightly in the United States, with 88% of iPhone owners saying theyâ€™d buy an Apple smartphone in the future, down from 93% last year. Paul Brown, the director at Strategy Analyticsâ€™ User Experience Practice, said that Appleâ€™s loyalty numbers may have taken a hit because of â€œnegative press prompted by a perceived lack of recent innovation.â€? Strategy Analyticsâ€™ press release is posted below.Boston, MA â€“ October 30, 2012 â€“ For the first time since the Apple iPhone was released in 2007, the number of iPhone owners who say they definitely will or probably will purchase their next phone from the same brand has declined.The recent Strategy Analytics Wireless Device Lab Report, iPhone Owner Loyalty Declines: Is Apple Losing its Innovation Edge?, found that only 75 percent of iPhone owners in Western Europe say they are likely to buy their next phone from Apple, down from 88 percent in 2011. US repeat purchase intentions have also seen a slight decline, down from 93 percent in 2011 to 88 percent in 2012.â€œThere is no doubt that Apple is continuing its success in retaining existing user base while attracting new customers,â€? commented Paul Brown, Director at Strategy Analyticsâ€™ User Experience Practice. â€œHowever, negative press prompted by a perceived lack of recent innovation by Apple has meant we are starting to see some growth in the number of previously highly loyal consumers who are now reconsidering whether or not they will purchase a new iPhone for their next device.â€?Taryn Tulay, Analyst at Strategy Analyticsâ€™ Wireless Device Lab added, â€œRespondents who say they probably will or definitely will not buy their next phone from Apple is low. However, it is the shift in the number of those who are unsure whether they will remain with the same brand for their next phone that Apple should be concerned about.â€?

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer cites the strong debut as a selling point to convince developers to create more apps for the company's platforms, primarily Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.REDMOND, Wash. -- Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said the company has sold 4 million copies of Windows 8 to consumers since the operating system debuted on Friday.Ballmer made the announcement today at the start of the Build conference, a show Microsoft is hosting on its campus for more than 2,000 developers. Microsoft is hoping to convince developers to create applications for its new operating system and the Windows Phone 8 operating system that debuted yesterday."In a sense, what these launches really do is the kick off the golden age of opportunity for you as developers," Ballmer said.Right now, the Windows Store, the application marketplace on Windows 8, has about 5,000 apps in stock for U.S. customers. ESPN said it will have an app for the store by the end of the year. Dropbox as well as enterprise software maker SAP are also working on apps that will be available soon. And Ballmer said that Twitter is working on a Windows 8 app that will be available "in the months ahead.""It will be the most important in terms of highlighting and showcasing some of these capabilities we're talking about today," Ballmer said.Toward the end of his speech, Ballmer became animated, raising his voice to exhort developers to build new applications for the various Microsoft platforms."Windows 8 is the best opportunity for software development today," Ballmer said. "Hundreds of millions of people are aching to use your apps, just dying to use your application."The centerpiece of Ballmer's pitch to developers: Microsoft's huge footprint. Ballmer said that there are currently 670 million PCs running Windows 7, all of which can be upgraded to Windows 8. What's more, analysts expect computer makers to sell 400 million PCs next year, most of which will run Windows."I think we're going to see a lot of growth and vitality and explosion in the PC market," Ballmer said. "This is a market in which you can do your best work, your most innovative work.... This is a market in which you can make money."Ballmer gave a demo of a variety of products running Windows 8, everything from an 82-inch touch screen monitor from Perceptive Pixel, a company Microsoft recently purchased, to Microsoft's new lightweight Surface tablet. He also showed Windows 8 running on Acer's new Aspire S7-191, a trim laptop with a touch-enabled screen."You say, 'Do people really want to us touch laptops?'" Ballmer said. "Touch laptops really are cool."Microsoft also released a new software development kit for Windows Phone 8, giving developers new tools to create application for the company's mobile phone platform. It's a business that's tiny, relative to rivals Google and Apple. But Microsoft believes that it will benefit from from the push behind Windows 8."The opportunity there is also excellent," Ballmer said.To spark more interest, developers were given a few freebies for attending the conference. Each one got a Microsoft Surface RT, 100 gigabytes of storage on Microsoft's SkyDrive Web service, and a Nokia Lumia 920 mobile phone.Updated at 10:50 a.m. PT with more details and analysis.Updated to clarify that ESPN's app will be available by the end of the year.

On Monday, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that pits a major textbook publisher against Supap Kirtsaeng, a student-entrepreneur who built a small business importing and selling textbooks.Like many Supreme Court cases, though, there's more than meets the eye. It's not merely a question of whether the Thai-born Kirtsaeng will have to cough up his profits as a copyright infringer; the case is a long-awaited rematch between content companies seeking to knock out the "first sale" doctrine on goods made abroad (not to mention their many opponents). That makes Wiley v. Kirtsaeng the highest-stakes intellectual property case of the year, if not the decade. It's not an exaggeration to say the outcome could affect the very notion of property ownership in the United States. Since most consumer electronics are manufactured outside the US and include copyrighted software in it, a loss for Kirtsaeng would mean copyright owners could tax, or even shut down, resales of everything from books to DVDs to cellphones."First sale" is the rule that allows owners to resell, lend out, or give away copyrighted goods without interference. Along with fair use, it's the most important limitation on copyright. So Kirtsaeng's cause has drawn a wide array of allies to his side. These include the biggest online marketplaces like eBay, brick-and-mortar music and game retailers, and Goodwillâ€”all concerned they may lose their right to freely sell used goods. Even libraries are concerned their right to lend out books bought abroad could be inhibited.John Wiley and Sons, the textbook publisher suing Kirtsaeng, has its share of backers as well, including the movie and music industries, software companies, and other book publishers. Those companies argue differential pricing schemes are vital to their success, and should be enforced by US courts. Nearly 30 amicus briefs have been filed in all.Supporters of Kirtsaeng are mobilized, following an alarmingâ€”but not precedentialâ€”loss in an earlier case, Omega v. Costco. On a call with reporters this week, librarians and lawyers for pro-Kirtsaeng companies painted a stark picture of what might happen should he lose the case. If the appellate court ruling against Kirtsaeng is allowed to stand, they suggest copyright owners could start to chip away at the basic idea of "you bought it, you own it.""This case is an attempt by some brands and manufacturers to manipulate copyright law, to control the distribution and pricing of legitimate, authentic goods," said eBay's top policy lawyer, Hillary Brill. "When an American purchases an authentic item, he shouldn't have to ask permission from the manufacturer to do with it what he wants."Without "first sale" doctrine in place, content companies would be allowed to control use of their goods forever. They could withhold permission for resale and possibly even library lendingâ€”or they could allow it, but only for an extra fee. It would have the wild effect of actually encouraging copyrighted goods to be manufactured offshore, since that would lead to much further-reaching powers."When we purchase something, we assume it's ours," said Overstock.com general counsel Mark Griffin. "What is proposed by [the content companies] is that we change the fundamental notion of ownership rights."Book publishers and their content-industry allies say those concerns are overblown. No assault on libraries and garage sales is forthcoming, they argue. These organizations simply have a right to set different prices abroad, without being undermined in the US by importation they say is illegal.The road to the Kirtsaeng clash has been a long one. Ultimately, this confrontation has been brewing since the rise of Internet marketplaces like eBay and Amazon in the mid-1990s. It became easier to get price information about goods being sold overseas, and consumers could see that identical or good-enough products were often being offered for prices much lower than the products being hawked in the US. At the same time, the big shopping sites made it simple for anyone to become their own business, selling and shipping around the globe.The textbook market was an obvious place to look for arbitrage. Students have been complaining about the high cost of books for many years; they also became the first group to enthusiastically embrace life online, and naturally looked for ways to cut costs.Foreign-born students, exposed to the lower-priced textbooks on trips home, became some of the first to see the opportunity. The same textbooks they were using to study medicine, engineering, and mathematics in the US were being sold in their home countries for a fraction of the cost. Often a Chinese, Thai, or Indian edition of a textbook had a more cheaply bound cover, sometimes with the local lettering on the front, and perhaps cheaper paper. The internal contents, however, were often the exact same English words being read by their classmates buying high-priced US editions.By 2003, the secret was out. Students' Internet-age solution to the problem of costly textbooks hit the front page of the New York Times. For some students, it was as simple as logging on to Amazon's UK site to comparison-shop.Â  A biochemistry text was $146.15 on the American Amazon site, but sold on the UK site for a mere $63.48, plus $8.05 shipping, one student found. A math textbook cost $110 in the US, but sold for $41.76 plus shipping in Britain.Even cheaper prices were found in Asia on English textbooks. The local college bookstore at Purdue University began buying overseas after it had to start competing with student-resellersâ€”the Indian Association at Purdue bought hundreds of books on their own.Neither the students nor the bookstores quoted by the Times in 2003 thought they were doing anything illegal. It was thought to be settled law; in a 1998 Supreme Court case called Quality King, the high court found that copyright owners couldn't control the re-importation of goods. They were limited by the "first sale" doctrine, which meant the rights held in a particular copy of a work expired once it was sold or given away.Years passed, and copyright owners found a wrinkle in that ruling. The shampoo bottles in Quality King had been made in the US but then shipped abroad, and re-imported. In cases where goods were actually produced abroadâ€”as foreign textbooks generally wereâ€”copyright owners argued unauthorized importers were guilty of infringement. Because imported foreign textbooks were not "made legally under this title [the Copyright Act]," they weren't subject to first sale at all. Or so the thinking went.It seems like an audacious argument, but sure enough, student book-sellers were hit with copyright lawsuits. They fought back hardâ€”but, for the most part, they have lost.Supap Kirtsaeng lost first and lost hardest. He came to the US from Thailand in 1997 to study at Cornell University, and later went on to get a PhD in mathematics from the University of Southern California. From 2007 to 2008, he financed his educationâ€”and made extra money, doubtlessâ€”by importing textbooks from Thailand and selling them under his eBay handle, bluechristine99.The book publisher, John Wiley and Sons, didn't want to see those books in the USâ€”and it had said so. Each book was marked: "[A]uthorized for sale in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East Only... The Publisher may recover damages including but not limited to lost profits and attorney's fees, in the event legal action is required."Kirtsaeng didn't abide by those warnings. He talked to some Thai friends; he consulted "Google Answers;" and he went ahead and sold books.The warning in the books was not an idle one. Wiley and Sons followed through on their threat and sued Kirtsaeng in 2008. Kirtsaeng's lawyer was unable to get the case thrown out on "first sale" grounds. By the end of 2009 Kirtsaeng was in court, justifying his importation business to a jury.Lawyers portrayed Kirtsaeng to the jury as a Thai "gray market" mogul who had gone far beyond financing his own college educationâ€”a portrayal that US publishers continue toÂ push. Working with friends and family who packaged and shipped his books, he made plenty of money selling extra books on eBay. Publishers' lawyers tallied up his receipts for the jury: $1.2 million in a few short years.The jury found Kirtsaeng guilty of infringing copyrights in eight books he had sold, and he was ordered to pay $600,000 in damagesâ€”$75,000 per book. He appealed, but a panel of judges ruled 2-1 in the publishers' favor.KirtsaengÂ returnedÂ to Thailand in 2010 after earning his doctorate from USC, but his court case continues.

Computerworld - Intel researchers are working on a 48-core processor for smartphones and tablets, but it could be five to 10 years before it hits the market."If we're going to have this technology in five to 10 years, we could finally do things that take way too much processing power today," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy. "This could really open up our concept of what is a computer... The phone would be smart enough to not just be a computer but it could be my computer."Enric Herrero, a research scientist at Intel Labs in Barcelona, said the lab is working on finding new ways to use and manage many cores in mobile devices.Today, some small mobile devices use multi-core chips. However, those multi-cores might be dual- or quad-core CPUs working with a few GPUs. Having a 48-core chip in a small mobile device would open up a whole new world of possibilities.At this point, researchers are working to see how to best use so many cores for one device."Typically a processor with one core would do jobs one after another," Herrero told Computerworld. "With multiple cores, they can divide the work among them."He explained that with many cores, someone could, for instance, be encrypting an email while also working on other power-intensive apps at the same time. It could be done today, but the operations might drag because they'd have to share resources.Tanausu Ramirez, another Intel research scientist working on the 48-core chip, said that if someone was, for example, watching a high-definition video, a 48-core chip would be able to use different cores to decode different video frames at the same time, giving the user a more seamless video experience.Ramirez also said that instead of one core working at near top capacity and using a lot of energy, many cores could run in parallel on different projects and use less energy."The chip also can take the energy and split it up and distribute it between different applications," he added.Justin Rattner, Intel's CTO, told Computerworld that a 48-core chip for small mobile devices could hit the market "much sooner" than the researchers' 10-year prediction."I think the desire to move to more natural interfaces to make the interaction much more human-like is really going to drive the computational requirements," he said. "Having large numbers of cores to generate very high performance levels is the most energy efficient way to deliver those performance levels."Rattner said functions such as speech recognition and augmented reality will push the need for more computational power."If it's doing speech recognition or computer vision... that's very computational intensive," he added. "It's just not practical to just take sound and pictures and send it up to the cloud and expect that some server is going to perform those tasks. So a lot of that will be pushed out to the client devices."Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group, said being able to have different device functions, as well as apps all running on their own cores would be a great advance.

While working on desktops or laptops, itâ€™s useful to have a second display handy. Another monitor can easily be plugged in, but why not use the screens you already have instead of going off and purchasing another one? With a little bit of effort, the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch can be turned into a second screen for your Mac or Windows computer. This can be used in two ways: using the iOS device as a true second display, or mirroring the content of your main display. In this post, youâ€™ll learn how to accomplish both.Air Display is actually two separate applications: one running in Windows or OS X, and an app running in iOS. First off, download and install the client on your computer. Next, youâ€™ll need to buy the iOS app for $9.99 on the App Store. Once both are running, connect both to the same WiFi network, and then follow the on-screen instructions to make sure they are talking to each other.Once theyâ€™re connected on OS X, you can configure them even further.
