In Windows 8 and Windows RT, Microsoft is aiming for a pleasant out-of-the-box experience. There's an app store for filling in gaps and adding functionality that isn't provided up front, but the core apps to power your communications with friends and colleagues come bundled with the operating system. There is Mail, Messaging, Calendar, and an innovative â€œPeopleâ€? app that brings all your contacts from various sources together into one central, interactive hub.All four core apps have promise in one way or another, especially the People app, which integrates with social media sites to provide more than the basic functionality youâ€™d expect from a contacts application.Microsoft isn't trying to create a replacement for Outlook hereâ€”after all, they don't want to give users any reasons not to buy Office. In general, the apps have just enough functionality to get by. Theyâ€™re passable for casual tablet usage, but Windows 8 is for both tablets and PCsâ€”and these applications will be lackluster if you try to use them to power your whole work day. Thereâ€™s also a chance youâ€™ll run into some bugs that make life a bit more frustrating than it was in Windows 7 or on competing tablet interfaces.In this article we will look at the four core communication apps. In addition, there is now Skype, which was released a couple of days before Windows 8 as a downloadable program from the Windows Store. The presence of Skype makes the Messaging applicationâ€™s limited functionality more tolerable, and Skypeâ€™s integration into People helps turn a Windows 8 tablet into something very much like a phone. As such, weâ€™ll look at how Skype provides some crucial functionality beyond whatâ€™s strictly out-of-the-box.Iâ€™ve been using the core apps for the past few weeks, on both a tablet (the version of the Samsung Series 7 11.6â€? Slate given to Windows developers for Windows 8 testing purposes) and in a virtual machine with a traditional mouse-and-keyboard setup. Iâ€™ve been keeping the OS and applications updated to make sure Iâ€?m not missing out on any new bits of functionality or bug fixes.As mentioned, there are bugs. I wonâ€™t claim these bugs will affect everyone, or even the majority, as Iâ€™ve heard from others that theyâ€™re running the apps without incident. However, searchingÂ Microsoftâ€™s support forumÂ will show various problems with the apps, and I suffered through several of them. In particular, I had trouble starting conversations with certain contacts in the instant messaging app, and problems getting the Mail/Calendar integration to work (e.g. accepting invitations from Mail).These applications are updated through the Windows Store, which provides a simpler update method than the traditional Windows Update. We've seen the apps updated a few times in the past few weeks, adding functionality such as conversation view in e-mail. There's nothing stopping Microsoft from continuing to improve them: hopefully, future updates will fix any remaining bugs and perhaps even add some new features.Weâ€™ll start with the highlight. The People app (which originated in Windows Phone) brings together contacts from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and your e-mail accounts, including Hotmail, Exchange, and Gmail. Oddly, Yahoo Mail contacts cannot be added to People, even though Yahoo Mail can be used in the Windows 8 Mail application.Once youâ€™ve linked all those accounts to People, youâ€™ll have a sprawling mass of contacts thatâ€™s not easy to get a handle on. Luckily, thereâ€™s an option to show contacts only from certain accounts, limiting the list to, say, just e-mail contacts rather than ones from social networks. Even if you do this, it's still useful to keep the social integration intact because the app will combine your Facebook and Twitter notificationsÂ into one giant feed.Inside the application, you can see recent activity from Twitter and Facebook:There's also a notification stream that shows the last week's worth of Twitter mentions and Facebook notifications youâ€™ve received. Clicking on any one ofÂ them opens a new screen in which you can post a reply to Facebook or Twitter without having to leave the People application:On the Windows 8 Start screen, the People live tile will scroll through your most recent social notifications. This is handy, because as of yet the Windows Store has no official Facebook or Twitter application to provide those updates in the live tile format. There's one annoying side effect to this, related to the fact that clicking a live tile doesn't necessarily take you directly to the content being shown that moment by the live tile. For example, you might see a Facebook notification on the live tile, but clicking it will bring you to whichever part of the People app you've accessed most recently.Thus, I would often click the tile expecting to see my latest Facebook and Twitter updates, and find that I'd have to perform a few touch gestures to get into the notifications page I was looking for. If you go into notifications from another part of the app, it will refresh them with the latest tweets and Facebook posts. But in cases when the notifications screen was the last one you accessed, and it thus appears immediately upon opening the app, you'll have to manually refresh the page to see the latest content. This requires swiping up from the bottom or down from the top to reveal the "app bar," which includes the refresh icon.Once you've got a fully updated notifications screen, it's not exactly perfect. For one thing, the updates are truncated to less than 140 characters, so you can't see a whole tweet unless you click on it.Back to the app's main screen, you'll see your contacts:Drilling down into a single contact shows you the person's latest social updates, new photos, and the like. The app bar includes options for saving them as a favorite or pinning them to the Start screen, while swiping in from the right to bring up the charm bar lets you share the contact via e-mail. The individual contact pages, of course, also let you contact the personÂ via e-mail or IM, or call them via Skype.Throughout most of Windows 8's availability in its RTM phase, the call button wouldn't work because Skype for Windows 8 didn't exist yet. That was rectified several days ago when Skype appeared in the Windows Store. Assuming you have it installed, clicking "call" in someone's contact page now takes you to Skype and lets you call their landline or cell phone, if you've got money in your account:If the person is a Skype contact of yours, you can call them for free, of course. In that case, you'll see the option to start a voice or video call within their People page:Click call, and you've got some free video call action going:Between the integration with Skype, and blurring the lines between a traditional contacts list and social networks, Microsoft's People app is a smart take on how to provide a central hub for keeping in touch with friends and colleagues on mobile devices and PCs. While not perfect, it goes beyond whatâ€™s offered out-of-the-box in rivals iOS and Android. Unfortunately, the rest of the core communication apps in Windows 8 aren't nearly as interesting, and rarely go past the most basic features you'd expect in typical mail, messaging, and calendar applications.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- As Hurricane Sandy battered the Northeast on Monday, a different kind of storm was brewing in Cupertino, Calif.Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) shook up its management team, announcing that two of its top executives had been shown the door.Scott Forstall -- responsible for the iOS software running iPhones and iPads, and often considered an heir-in-waiting to CEO Tim Cook -- is the most prominent executive departing. He'll stick around as an advisor for the rest of this year, then leave the company, Apple said in a press release.The move is a surprise: Forstall was one of the top executives at Apple over the past decade, and his team's software fuels Apple's premiere devices.Yet Forstall was also behind Apple's Maps software, a debacle that was widely mocked on social media. The debut of Maps was so disastrous that Cook issued a public apology for the app and recommended rival applications while Apple worked on improvements-- including the Google Maps software that it replaced.Siri, the iPhone and iPad's electronic personal assistant, is also an incomplete product. The service is frequently down and remains very hit-or-miss when delivering answers.A group of Apple executives will replace Forstall, each sharing some of his responsibilities.Eddy Cue, head of Apple's iTunes and iCloud services, will take over Siri and Maps. Mac OS chief Craig Federighi will take control of iOS, uniting Apple's two operating systems into one product group. And Jony Ive, Apple's head of hardware design, will be in charge of Apple's software look and feel going forward as well.Cook said the management changes will "encourage even more collaboration" between the company's hardware and software teams."We are in one of the most prolific periods of innovation and new products in Apple's history," Cook said in a written statement.Apple made a few other executive changes as well.Apple's widely criticized retail store chief, John Browett, is leaving after just nine months of the job. Since coming over from British electronic store giant Dixons, Browett has had one stumble after another, including slashing the number of workers in stores -- for which Cook also had to apologize.As the company searches for an executive to replace Browett, Cook will personally oversee the retail unit.Apple also announce that Mac hardware guru Bob Mansfield -- who planned last year to retire, but backtracked two months later -- will head a new group called "Technologies."The unit will focus on mobile devices, putting all of Apple's wireless products under one roof. Mansfield will also head the semiconductor teams, "who have ambitious plans for the future," Apple said.

MIAMI -- While complaints can be heard far and wide that it's hard to find the right IT security experts to defend the nation's cyberspace, the real problem in hiring security professionals is the roadblocks put up by lawyers and human resources personnel and a complete lack of understanding of geek culture, says security consultant Winn Schwartau.Take Janet Napolitano, U.S. secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who has said the country can't find the right people for network defense. The real problem is a misunderstanding of computer geeks, their personalities, habits and their backgrounds, said Schwartau today during his talk at the Hacker Halted information security conference here.MIAMI -- While complaints can be heard far and wide that it's hard to find the right IT security experts to defend the nation's cyberspace, the real problem in hiring security professionals is the roadblocks put up by lawyers and human resources personnel and a complete lack of understanding of geek culture, says security consultant Winn Schwartau.Take Janet Napolitano, U.S. secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who has said the country can't find the right people for network defense. The real problem is a misunderstanding of computer geeks, their personalities, habits and their backgrounds, said Schwartau today during his talk at the Hacker Halted information security conference here.NEWS: Gartner: 10 critical IT trends for the next five yearsÂ MORE: Ernst & Young's IT Security survey shows struggle to secure mobile, social media, cloudComputer geeks are discriminated against under hiring rules and legal niceties that often categorize them as undesirables. "We do not fit the mold. We at the outer limits of normal," Schwartau said.According to Schwartau, there's a gauntlet of hiring obstacles today that actually work to discriminate against computer geeks who have the expertise to do the job of protecting government networks. Demands for college degrees and IT certifications and the ability to get IT security clearances should not be a priority in hiring, said Schwartau. "Forget education," he said, adding, "We need to re-design clearances -- they're a Cold War relic designed for nuclear secrets and 1950s crypto." The era of 9-to-5 is also over, he added.He said what's holding up hiring IT security professionals can be found in the thinking of human resources departments that frown on conditions such as attention deficit disorder and autism, or obsessive-compulsive personalities which are typical of computer geeks willing to focus on an issue through the night. And although hiring rules in place tend to go the extra mile to accept alcoholism, the slightest type of illegal drug infraction makes it tough for job applicants. "We've got to start getting politically incorrect if we want to get the job done," said Schwartau.If there are tests that need to be done to probe the basic trustworthiness of job applicants for sensitive network security jobs in government or industry, said Schwartau, it would be better to try industrial psychological profiling, making it clear that anyone that passed it and got hired would be subject to it over and over again during the time they were in their job.Computer geeks could be asked something like, "If your wife and daughter were kidnapped, will you turn against my company?" he suggested. The answer would likely need to be "yes," because "anything else is deceptive.""Do you need a secret clearance to defend a network? They say you do," said Schwartau, alluding to government rules. But the government is competing against private industry and, yes, the criminal world, for the kind of talent held by those who really know about network weaknesses.

I sat staring at the screen, my emotions lodged somewhere between dumbfounded and despondent. From what I was seeing, I knew I'd made a horrific mistake, and restitution must be made immediately. I'd been told time and time again there was no going back; what's done is done, you have to accept it, there's no living in the past. But a violation this total demanded only one response from me.I had to uninstall Windows 8, and I had to do it immediately.What possessed me to put the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system on my home computer this past fateful weekend, I'll never know. To some extent, I'm sure, it was the persistent ministrations of my colleagues Michael Muchmore and Samara Lynn, who had been trying to sell me on Windows 8 for months. I'd dabbled in every major version since the Developer Preview, and never warmed to it, but I'd somehow succeeded in convincing myself that this time things would be different.Yet the instant I saw my entire 1,920 x 1,200 monitor consumed with only the Windows 8 update notifications â€“ the rest of the screen a field of white vast enough to drive Alaska to fits of murderous envy â€“ it was clear I'd been drastically mistaken. Windows 8 is not, by any stretch of the imagination, for me. And it's time I stopped pretending otherwise.Don't get me wrong: My feelings about it have evolved, and even softened, over the past year. At first I saw nothing of worth in this radical new spin on the tried-and-true Windows formula. But as I explored it on touch systems, rather than on my beloved (and â€“ pardon me if I brag â€“ insanely powerful) desktop PC, I began to discover some virtues in it. To my eye (and fingers), it's at least as good at driving such devices as iOS, and perhaps even better: It's slicker, livelier, and treats the user as more innately capable of making intelligent decisions.More power still revealed itself when I did additional research. Being a big traditional computer guy, I live by the keyboard â€“ and discovering and mastering Windows 8's myriad Windows key shortcuts increased and improved the level of my accomplishments. It was partially this experience, I think, that led me to believe that maybe I could deal with this on a 24/7 basis away from work.Unfortunately, the disjointed time I'd spent with Windows 8 before did not prepare me for what using it at home would entail. After (an admittedly painless) installation, I was faced with the garish Start screen, loaded with apps that didn't interest me at all. I clicked on a couple to see how I'd respond to them. The Weather and Stock apps were pretty, no doubt â€“ but did each one need to occupy upwards of two million pixels on my screen? Because all the Start apps open full-screen, too little information was looking much too big â€“ and there's no way to change this.Frustrated, I decided to check my Hotmail account (also the source of the Microsoft ID I entered while configuring Windows 8). I clicked on one new message, then another. The first wasn't marked read. Clicking on a third did mark the second one read, for some reason. I decided I wanted to file these, so I held down the mouse button and dragged the message just as on Outlook.com, but that didn't work as it had for some 17 years of Windows history. To move the message now, you have to click an icon on the bottom right of the screen to start the process; this is an unintuitive change whether you're using your finger or a mouse.I was certain that Internet Explorer must be better. Launching it revealed the ITProPortal home page, centred on my enormous display, with gaping chasms of white on each side. Naturally, I couldn't resize the window. So I went to open a new tab. Except I couldn't do that, either: One browser window per screen.I then fled to my safe haven, the Desktop â€“ now treated just as any other app. No Start button, right. But I could launch Internet Explorer here. Finally! Separate windows! Tabs! Except... things didn't look very good. The smoothly elegant rounded glass of Aero has been replaced by sharp, unfriendly two-dimensional corners I was sure had gone the way of Microsoft Bob. I moved to use Windows key-D to show my bare desktop, but my finger slipped half a second too early and I was thrown back to Start.From there, I decided maybe I should see the Control Panel. That shunted me back to the Desktop. Ditto Task Manager. Ditto any of several other deep-dive settings functions I use on a daily basis. But changing the image on the Start or Lock screens, or powering off the computer, could only be done through the new Windows 8 interface.I gritted my teeth and endured it for as long as I could, the constant schizophrenic flipping between Start and Desktop environments propelling me ever nearer to total mental breakdown. When I decided to update a few apps from the Microsoft Store, and received the indication that wasted more 90 per cent of the screen, I knew it was time for this experiment to end. I wiped the hard drive, reinstalled Windows 7, and have not looked back since.As I struggled to try to make sense of what was where, and more importantly why things were where they were, it became clearer than ever to me that Microsoft had never actually intended the Start screen and the Desktop to work together. So haphazard, so clunky, so confusing was everything, one could only conclude that all the company cared about was the touch market, and it was doing everything it could to discourage Desktop (and desktop) use once and for all.Microsoft is not necessarily wrong for doing this. With tablets and other mobile systems increasing in popularity, any tech company should be courting them. And, as far as Windows 8 and its kid cousin, Windows RT, are concerned, ruling over the kingdom of touch is a real possibility. Although I'm not sure I can really say I've liked using Windows 8 on touch devices, I can absolutely say I haven't hated it.Using it on anything else is another story. It makes everything I do more difficult. Michael and Samara have expounded at great length on what Windows 8 has to offer (see Michaelâ€™s review here), and I don't dispute much of what they have to say. But for people who want or need to use non-touch desktop or laptop computers in anything resembling the classic way, the learning curve isn't just steep â€“ it's vertical. Windows 8 was not designed to be used that way, but I was shocked at just how unfriendly it was towards me and my way of working, and how unwelcome it made me feel for wanting to do things with minimal convolution.I realise I'm not part of Microsoft's target audience anymore, but I still think power users like myself â€“ I've been using Windows for 22 years â€“ deserve better. If I've been using GUI-based operating systems for nearly three decades and this one regularly for over a year, and it still fails to suffice for basic tasks, there's something seriously wrong.The danger Microsoft faces is also the danger it's scrupulously trying to avoid: The industry isn't the same as it once was. Phones and tablets may be taking over, but Microsoft's dominance is also threatened as it's never been before. Real alternatives are getting real attention, and they've never had a better opportunity to gobble up the people Microsoft is casting aside.The latest versions of Mac OS X are far more usable and appealing than Windows 8. Many Linux distributions, starting with the well-known Ubuntu, have made rapid-fire about-faces in recent months to get themselves in shape to fill the vacuum Windows 8 has been creating. Both operating systems make multi-window multitasking a clean, smooth reality, acknowledging, as Microsoft will not, that most people still work that way.Hope for us Windows lovers, however, is not necessarily lost. Microsoft has demonstrated some ability to learn from its mistakes and come back stronger. Nearly six years ago, Windows Vista fizzled upon its release, but was redeemed by a comprehensive service pack and then, within two and a half years or so, Windows 7. There's no reason it can't weave similar magic on 2012's deeply flawed OS.But Microsoft must have the will to do so. If the future is touch, why should it waste time and resources considering how Windows 8 works with creaky keyboards and mice? What Microsoft has forgotten is that you can't get to the future without moving through the present. In trying to skip over today, the folks in Redmond have angered a lot of people â€“ and wasted their time and monitor real estate just like they've wasted mine.I've been forgiving of Microsoft's foibles and idiosyncrasies for a long time, but my patience has about run out. If Microsoft wants me to use Windows 8 or a touch system, it has to give me a concrete reason â€“ and one boring app per screen ain't gonna cut it. Otherwise, I'll stick with Windows 7 â€“ and maybe even dual-boot Linux with it at the same time. Those two operating systems together give me everything I need. Windows 8 doesn't come close. Worse still, it doesn't even try.Published under license from Ziff Davis, Inc., New York, All rights reserved.Copyright Â© 2012 Ziff Davis, Inc

Ok, so this app made me feel really dirty when I downloaded it. Itâ€™s called Badabing! and it basically goes through your friendsâ€™ photos on Facebook to pull out the ones of them at the pool or beach. In other words, weâ€™re talking about scantily clad photos here.I of course, for the sake of technology journalism, had to download the app and give it a whirl. It actually kind of works and itâ€™s really creepy. To protect the innocent, Iâ€™m not going to post any actual screenshots of my Facebook friends. Theyâ€™d kill me. And probably the folks who made this app.The app is $1.99 and all you have to do is log in with your Facebook account and then choose a few friends to dig up some dirt on. The company has some sort of image recognition technology that looks forâ€¦skin?After your search is complete you can bookmark your favorite photos. Now letâ€™s get to the heart of the matter, is this wrong to do? I mean, technically, your friends have uploaded these photos and shared them with you anyway. All this app does is do a search, albeit a search with icky intent.Moral of the story, donâ€™t upload photos to Facebook and share them with friends unless you want them looking at them. Especially if youâ€™re in a bikini or tight swim trunks.Creep you out? Cool use of tech? Tell us in the comments.

Federal authorities said they uncovered an advanced bank heist that defrauded Citigroup of more than $1 million by exploiting a security loophole in the way it handles electronic payments.The scam worked by simultaneously withdrawing funds from cash advance kiosks maintained in at least 11 casinos located in California and Nevada, according to an indictment unsealed late last week in federal court in San Diego. Alleged ringleader Ara Keshishyan recruited at least 13 people to make transactions from different kiosks in each location. To exploit the weakness, the multiple advance requests had to be near identical and had to be made in the same 60-second window, FBI officials said in a press release."In order to obtain the case, the conspirators exploited a loophole in Citi's account security protocols, which caused Citi's account reconciliation systems to treat identical, near-simultaneous withdrawals as duplicates of a single withdrawal from an individual Citi Checking account," prosecutors alleged in the indictment. "In exploiting this loophole, the conspirators withdrew identical sums of money in succession from a single Citi checking account all within a specific time window. This allowed the conspirators to fraudulently withdraw several times the amount of money deposited into each account."The defendants obtained more than $1 million from Citigroup, prosecutors said. To conceal the scam, they kept withdrawal below $10,000 to avoid federal transaction reporting requirements. The kiosks were operated by Global Cash Access, a Las Vegas-based financial transaction services company. They allow casino patrons to get cash that's held in personal banking accounts. The Citigroup loophole has been closed, The Press-Enterprise reported.Prosecutors said Keshishyan caused sums of $10,000 or less to be deposited into various Citi checking accounts. The conspirators he allegedly hired would then use Citi ATM cards to obtain cash amounts from the kiosks that collectively exceeded the account balances. The defendants allegedly used the stolen funds to gamble at the casinos, allowing them to receive free rooms and other perks in return for high-roller status.All 14 defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to illegally structure financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements. The maximum penalty if convicted on those charges is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Keshishyan has also been charged with 14 counts of bank fraud, each of which is punishable by up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Prosecutors are also seeking forfeiture of money and property belonging to the defendants.It's unknown if any of the defendants have issued a plea in the case.

Hurricane Sandy may have stopped Google's Android event, but it couldn't stop the Google website. There will be no swanky event in downtown New York City, but Google's Android team has taken to a blog post to announce the latest Android devices, including the long-rumored Nexus 4 phone made by LG and Nexus 10 tablet made by Samsung.Google is also refreshing its 7-inch Nexus 7 tablet, bringing the total number of Nexus devices on the market to three.Nexus devices, unlike all the other hundreds of Android phone and tablets out there, are built in close partnership between Google and other phone or tablet makers. They are also the first devices to run the new version of Android. In this case, all the devices being announced today run Android 4.2, the next version of Jelly Bean. Android 4.2 isn't a complete overhaul of the software, but adds such features as a new keyboard, wireless video streaming services, a 360-degree photo feature, and a new Google Now service."People increasingly have more than one device, and they switch between them many times a day. Nexus â€” Google's hardware line for Android devices â€” gets rid of the hassle," Google's Senior Vice President of Android, Andy Rubin, said in the post. "Just sign in with your Google Account and everything is there ready to go, whatever device you're using: photos, emails, contacts, bookmarks, even your entertainment on Google Play."Below are details on all of the new devices:Nexus 4 (Starts at $299) The new Nexus 4 phone, which is made by LG, will replace the Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone that came out about a year ago. The phone has a large 4.7-inch screen with a high-resolution 1280 x 768 display, and a fast quad-core S4 Pro processor. The camera on the phone has also been updated (it was one of the major pain points of the last version) -- it now has an 8-megapixel camera on the back and a 1.3-megapixel camera on the front for video chatting.The $299 base version has 8GB of storage and a $349 version will have 16GB of space. For now, Google will only offer the phone unlocked through T-Mobile, meaning it won't be available through Verizon, Sprint or AT&T. That also means it will not have LTE service in the U.S.The new Android 4.2 software brings new gesture typing, "which lets you glide your finger over the letters you want to type on the keyboard," Google says. It also supports wireless video and new photo features. The phone will be available to order through Google's Play store starting today and in select T-Mobile retail stores and online on Nov. 14.Nexus 7 (Starts at $199) Moving up to the 7-inch screen, Google has slightly refreshed its Nexus 7 tablet, which it announced back in June in collaboration with Asus. The new version will run Android 4.2, but there is also a 32GB version now that will cost $249. There will be a 32GB version with HSPA+ cellular connectivity for $299. That version will work with AT&T SIM cards and service. The 16GB version with WiFi only costs $199.Apple's iPad Mini, which has a larger 7.9-inch screen, goes on sale this Friday for $329, while Amazon's Kindle Fire HD, which has 16GB of storage, starts at $199.Nexus 10 ($399) Of course, there's one more! The Nexus 10, as you might guess, has a 10-inch screen and the latest Android 4.2 software. Built by Samsung, the tablet has a high-resolution 2560 x 1600 resolution screen, similar to the Retina display on the new iPad. Internally, the tablet has a dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM. The 16GB version will start at $399.ABC News has been promised a hands-on look at the new devices. Stay tuned for more information.

Icrontic has been around for twelve years. With thousands of people coming and going, variously circling in and out of the group as lives and times and interests change, old online communities like ours become a magnifying glass into the ebb and flow of the human experience.Of course, death is a natural part of that experience, and weâ€™ve had our fair share over the years. From natural causes to tragic accidents, our community has been through a lot of down moments. Thankfully, weâ€™ve also experienced the joyous news of families, new children, marriages, and career successes that far outnumber the sad times.This past week, however, hit us harder than weâ€™ve ever been hit. One of our core community members lost his father suddenly and unexpectedly, right before our annual Oktoberfest gathering. The community reeled; we didnâ€™t know how to help our dear friend cope with his shocking loss. For a man who has done so much for Icrontic over the years, we wanted to turn the tables and be there for him, but we didnâ€™t know how. All we could do is take up a collection for his family to help with the funeral costs, and to make a small donation to a local charity in his fatherâ€™s name. People sitting behind keyboards thousands of miles away, some in other countries, some on other continents, had only this one mechanism by which to extend their condolences. They canâ€™t hug their friend while he weeps, so they do the only thing they can do. They write some words, maybe they call, maybe they email, maybe they open up Paypal. What can they do? None of it seems sufficient, especially when you cannot get there. This is the only true downside of online communityâ€”when your friends need you, physically, distance can be an insurmountable obstacle.Soon after, those who could began gathering together for Oktoberfest, here in Detroit. This is an event thatâ€™s been going on for five years, and is our second largest annual community gathering. We anticipated over 50 people coming in from all over the country for this event. This was going to be an especially poignant gathering because itâ€™s the first in our new headquarters.The Icrontic gatherings have been going on since 2004. From small and humble beginnings, we have blossomed into a full-blown convention organization, culminating in Expo Icrontic every summer. Many community members save up their vacation days and travel accounts to come up, over, or down to Detroit to be with their online family. This event was going to be incredible.On the first day, tragedy struckâ€”again. What was supposed to be a fantastic party and community gathering has turned into a memorial service and an extended wake. For days now, a group of Icrontians has been together in a large house in Detroit coming to terms with the sudden loss of our friend.Itâ€™s still abstract for me to type those words out. They happened just days ago. Spencer was in my living room, fifteen feet from where Iâ€™m sitting. I hugged him hello, told him I was glad he was here, and we struck up a normal nerdy conversation. He looked around the house, proud of the work he had done to help the progress of ICHQ Detroit (he did a ton of work sanding our front entrance ceiling, helping with wall repairs, and helping scrub grout stains off our new tile in the bathroom), and marveled at how far it had come in such a short time. He was just here.I am extremely fortunate. I was here. I have extremely recent memories of Spence. I was part of the small group that last saw him alive. I feel guilty that people who were closer to him did not get that same treasure. I saw him moments before he died, and he was laughing. I have that memory and so many others donâ€™t. I feel terrible about that.I returned from the hospital after a long and horrible night, and came up to the front door. There was a group of people standing on the porch, crying. I grabbed the first person I saw and didnâ€™t let go. We wept.People milling around. From every corner of the house, you could hear either laughter or tears. Spencer was a tremendously comical person. He laughed loud and hard and often. When we tell stories of him, itâ€™s almost impossible not to laugh. You can only cry so much.Should the party go on? Should I cancel my trip? Should we do the beer tasting? What should we do?The group came to the consensus that the costume party and gaming would carry on. Spencer would definitely not have wanted us to cancel the event on his behalf, and he most certainly wouldnâ€™t want us to not game. Gaming was his greatest joy.Fuck it, we said, weâ€™re carrying on. For Spencer.I had guilt about this new sudden tragedy overshadowing the other recent tragedy, the loss of one of my best friendsâ€™ dad. I sent him a text message. â€œIâ€™m thinking about you.â€? Here is a person who is suffering alone, hundreds of miles from his Icrontic family, who has just lost his father, and now he has to deal with finding out one of his good friends died in a senseless car accident, before his fatherâ€™s memorial service is even complete. Why can I not have a magic wand? I am the community manager for this group, and more than ever I felt completely and utterly powerless. I wanted to be able to get everybody into a room together for a group hug.Being thousands of miles away when your friend dies, without enough money to get an emergency plane ticket. What can you do? You need information, you want to talk to people. The group is thereâ€”awayâ€”inaccessible. They are healing, talking, laughing, hugging, crying. You need to be a part of that, yet you cannot.The Icrontic community is the most generous online community in the worldâ€”I am convinced of that. In this past week, thousands of dollars have been raised to help with funeral expenses and plane tickets. People made discreet arrangements. People flew in. Friends arrived, and got the laughter, tears, screams, and hugs out that they so desperately needed. If only it could have been everyone. If only.There is a lot of survivorâ€™s guilt going on. Two cars left for the restaurant that night. My son was in one, and I am so, so glad he wasnâ€™t in the other. My other son decided not to come that night because he was having a party with his friends. If he had come, he almost certainly would have been in that car. I am so, so glad he wasnâ€™t. I feel terrible about that, and I am struggling with my guilt for thinking those thoughts, while at the same time understanding that itâ€™s completely rational and normal for me to have them. Group therapy has been helpful. Weâ€™re all starting to share our feelings and dark thoughts. If I had chosen a different restaurant, Spencer would be alive. If Spencer had gotten in the other side, it may have been Nick instead. If Spencer came with me. If I hadnâ€™t stopped to pee on the way out of the house. If we had left ten seconds later or sooner. If, if, if.There was a lot of speculation about the driver of the other vehicle. Violent, angry rants about revenge. Calm, rational discourse. Drunk, not drunk. Male, female. We were looking for a focus. We needed a bad guy to pin this on. We needed to make sense of this. Of courseÂ it was a loud, obnoxious, easy-to-hate drunk driver. What else could it be? Or a mother. Or a grandfather. Or a brother or cherished son with a promising career ahead of him. Maybe a teacher. Maybe a volunteer. Maybe a social worker. Maybe a drug addict or a thug. Maybe a dealer or a criminal. We donâ€™t know, so we create characters.Today we say goodbye. Today is the funeral, and today is the end of the gathering. After people grieve again, they will scatter and disperse back to their homes around the country.Icrontic is forever changed by this. We have had a unique opportunity to really come to terms with the death of a dear friend, in a group setting full of open communication, no barriers, and true companionship. We are very, very lucky for that. This is not the first tragedy in our community, nor will it be the lastâ€¦ It was, however, one of the most educational.Icrontic will carry on. For Bart, for Keith, for Angel Heather, for Ericâ€™s dad, for all the others who we have lost along the way. For Spencer.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday considers whether to allow a challenge to a federal law that provides for large-scale electronic surveillance of international phone calls and emails. The case is not a direct test of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Rather, it is a test of whether the law can even be challenged in court at all.How FISA Came To BeCongress first passed the law in 1978 to prevent the kind of warrantless surveillance of Americans that had been uncovered by congressional investigators. Known by the acronym FISA, it required the government to obtain a warrant from a special intelligence court when conducting electronic surveillance of individuals abroad â€” surveillance that could pick up communications to and from people in the United States.After Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration secretly circumvented the law. When its warrantless wiretapping was disclosed, the administration proposed legislation to quell the resulting furor. In 2008, Congress passed a new version of the law, loosening the reins considerably. It limited the FISA court's supervision, did away with the previous requirement for individual targeting, and instead allowed the government to monitor large swaths of people. Critics called it the "vacuum cleaner" approach to electronic surveillance.Groups and individuals with frequent international contacts challenged the law in court, contending that FISA, by authorizing "dragnet surveillance," violates the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches. But Monday's Supreme Court arguments do not get to that issue. Instead, the court is focusing on a threshold question: whether the case can be brought at all because the challengers cannot prove with certainty that their communications were intercepted.Among those suing to invalidate FISA are human rights groups such as Amnesty International, journalists and lawyers for detainees. The lawyers, for instance, routinely have telephone conversations with the families of detainees, with witnesses and with investigators. The government, however, contends that without proof positive, the claims to have been spied upon are speculative, and the challengers have no legal standing to bring a case to court.The challengers counter that the government's position amounts to a Catch-22 because in a secret program, there is no way to prove you've been monitored."Their argument is you can't challenge the statute if you can't show your own communications have been acquired under it," says Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU, who is representing the groups. But the government, he adds, refuses to "tell you if your own communications have been acquired under it."A federal appeals court in New York agreed with the challengers that they have suffered a concrete injury that justifies allowing the case to go forward. That court said that based on the challengers' reasonable fear of being monitored, they have largely abandoned international phone and email communications, and have spent time and money to travel overseas to meet with people in person in order to be free from government surveillance.Todd Hinnen, who served as acting assistant attorney general for National Security in the Obama administration, concedes that because of the secret nature of the surveillance, "it's very difficult for a plaintiff to make specific and concrete allegations."But, he adds, in an age of terrorism, the intelligence community needs greater latitude, and therefore Congress "consciously limited the circumstances" under which FISA can be challenged.Basically, the government argues that the civil liberties protections in the law are internal. For example, the statute requires the attorney general and National Intelligence director to periodically assess the steps taken to minimize the effect of the surveillance on U.S. citizens.But at the same time, the law does not contemplate a direct challenge in the courts. As Hinnen puts it: "It is a statute that governs foreign intelligence practices, targeting foreign citizens overseas, subjects that traditionally have been viewed as the core of Congress and the executive branch's prerogative."Jaffer, of the ACLU, replies that if the Supreme Court accepts the government's position, the justices "will be accepting that this statute is immune to the kind of judicial review that we generally think federal statutes ought to be subject to."After all, the issue being argued on Monday is not whether the law is constitutional, he observes, but "whether we have the right to challenge the constitutionality of the law."It may seem like a technicality, but it is â€” at this point â€” the whole ball of wax.

The shrinking size of features on modern processors is slowly approaching a limit where the wiring on chips will only be a few atoms across. As this point approaches, both making these features and controlling the flow of current through them becomes a serious challenge, one that bumps up against basic limits of materials.During my visit to IBM's Watson Research Center, it was clear that people in the company are already thinking about what to do when they run into these limits. For at least some of them, the answer would involve a radical departure from traditional chipmaking approaches, switching from traditional semiconductors to carbon nanotubes. And, while I was there, the team was preparing a paper (now released by Nature Nanotechnology) that would report some significant progress: a chip with 10,000 working transistors made from nanotubes, formed at a density that's two orders of magnitude higher than any previously reported effort.During my visit to Watson, I spoke with George Tulevski, who is working on the nanotube project, and is one of the authors of the recent paper. Tulevski described nanotubes as a radical rethinking of how you build a chip. "Silicon is a solid you carve down," he told Ars, "while nanotubes are something you have to build up." In other words, you can't start with a sheet of nanotubes and etch them until you're left with the wiring you want.One possible alternative is to use graphene, a sheet of carbon a bit like an unrolled nanotube, which can potentially be etched into distinct features. The problem, according to Tulevski, is that graphene doesn't naturally have a bandgap, the feature of semiconductors that makes them useful for circuitry. It's possible to manipulate graphene so that it develops a bandgap, but that adds to the complexity of manufacturing devices. Some carbon nanotubes, in contrast, are semiconductors without the need for any manipulation (others are metals).This still left IBM with a choice, Tulevski said. You could potentially attempt to grow a pure population of carbon nanotubes in place, on your chip. We've gotten much better at controlling the growth of nanotubes, and IBM has equipment in house that be been used to produce them. The problem there is that, if anything goes wrong with just one of the tubes, the whole chip would be lost. We may have gotten much better, but we've not gotten that good.So, Tulevski's group is taking a different approach: buy off-the-shelf nanotubes, isolate the ones they want, and then assemble them on a chip.The first couple of steps of this is easier than it sounds. Tulevski showed off a large jar, obtained from a chemical manufacturer, that contained a mixture of carbon nanotubes. As it turns out, the two types of nanotubes, metals and semiconductors, interact differently with a standard column of the type commonly used in chemistry and biochemistry labs. Simply run a mixture down the column, and it's possible to separate out a relatively pure population of one type. To make matters even more convenient, the two populations are slightly different colors.Once you have a collection of semiconducting nanotubes, you have to build circuits out of these. If we're ever going to make processors out of them, this has to be done quickly, cheaply, and consistently. As Tulevsky described it in referring to purifying the right nanotubes, a one part-per-billion error rate just isn't good enough when you consider the number of transistors on a modern chip.The team at Watson is working on solution processing, which is where the new paper comes in. The idea is to pre-pattern the needed circuitry onto a chip using IBM's existing foundry experience. Once that's in place, a solution containing carbon nanotubes can be washed across the chip, at which point they'll drop out of solution and attach to the chip based on the pattern.In the paper, the pattern was set up by etching away silicon dioxide to reveal an underlying layer of hafnium dioxide. The HfO layer could interact with a charged organic molecule (4-(N-hydroxycarboxamido)-1-methylpyridinium iodide), creating a charged surface. The carbon nanotubes could then be floated across this surface while encased in a coating of an organic molecule with the opposite charge. A simple ion exchange reaction locks the nanotube in place above the hafnium layer.With the hafnium features at 70nm wide, this process was used to create field-effect transistors (FETs), and it worked with an efficiency of over 90 percent. The density of these FETs was 10 per square centimeter, 100 times higher than the previous reported best. And these devices could be made en masse: the researchers were able to test over 10,000 of the FETs on a single chip, and found over 7,000 functional ones (most of the rest ended up with a metallic nanotube instead of a semiconductor).This still isn't ready for chip manufacture. But it's a lot closer than most previous efforts, and gives IBM's team some obvious things to troubleshoot if they want to boost the efficiency further.

The two have been benefiting from losses at rivals like Nokia and Motorola, Canaccord Genuity says, and that trend should continue.Controlling all of the mobile market's profits doesn't appear to be enough for Apple and Samsung anymore. Now they're actually generating more than 100 percent of the industry's earnings -- 106 percent, to be precise -- according to a report from Canaccord Genuity.That may seem impossible, but it's largely because rivals -- like Research In Motion, Nokia, and Motorola -- posted operating losses during the September quarter, the firm said."With Samsung extending its overall smartphone and Android market share combined with Apple's strength in high-end smartphones, competing smartphone [original equipment manufacturers] continued to struggle to compete with these dominant smartphone OEMs," Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley noted today.It's actually the second quarter in a row that the two companies captured greater than 100 percent of the industry's profits, Walkley added. In the second quarter, Apple and Samsung held 108 percent shareWalkley estimates that Apple captured 59 percent of the industry's operating profits in the calendar third quarter, with only 6.3 percent of global handset unit sales and 15.4 percent of smartphone unit sales.Samsung, meanwhile, controlled 47 percent of the profits, up from 37 percent in the second quarter. It held 25.6 percent of the global handset unit market share in the third quarter, up from 25.3 percent in the second quarter, in part because of strong Galaxy S3 sales. Walkley expects Samsung to maintain its leading unit market share position during the fourth quarter and beyond, continuing to supplant longtime leader Nokia.The two companies' dominance should continue in the current quarter, Walkley said, with Apple likely to take some share from Samsung during the period because of strong global demand for the iPhone 5.The numbers continue to paint a dismal picture for the handset industry at large, with barely anyone being able to make money aside from Apple and Samsung. The giants continue to dominate and squeeze rivals like Motorola while low-cost handset makers like ZTE are applying pressure on the low end.

One of the notable features announced with the release of Android 4.2 yesterday was support for multiple users on a single Android device. Google's list of 4.2 features, though, makes it very clear that multiple users is supported only on Android 4.2 tablets, not phones.TechCrunch speculates that the limitation is due to a patentâ€”US 2005/0107114 A1, "Multi-user mobile telephone," to be specific. The patent was filed in late 2004, granted in 2005, and was penned by then-current Symbian employee Tim O'Cock. The abstract makes it pretty clear that it envisions several different people, each with their own personalizations, using a single device:A mobile telephone is designed to be used by several different end-users at different times. A first end-user can alter the mobile telephone so that it operates in a manner specific to that first end-user and a subsequent end-user can alter the mobile telephone so that it operates in a manner specific to that subsequent end-user; each end-user has only to respond to prompts displayed on a screen in order to alter the mobile telephone so that it operates in a manner specific to that end-user.The USPTO lists the patent's current assignment with both Tim O'Cock and Symbian Limited, with both pointed back to Nokia. TechCrunch guesses that the original intent behind the patent was to take revenue from emerging markets by providing an easy method for lots of different folks to share a single phone; in areas of the world where cellular phones are expensive, a feature which lets several people use the same phone gives that phone a competitive advantage.It's easy to see how this patent might be a potential stumbling block to any company wanting to implement a similar feature. The patent language is broad enough to cover just about any possible implementation of multiple user accounts, and even though no Nokia phone has shown up with anything like "multiple users" on the feature list, anyone with something similar in mind would have to deal with licensing from Nokia.The loophole which Google is using to bring the feature to tablets is that the patent language very clearly states "mobile telephone" over and over again. In 2004 when the application was filed, consumer-grade tablet devices were but a twinkle in technologists' eyes (stylus-driven "tablet" notebook computers notwithstanding). The patent narrowly applies to phones, not "mobile communications devices" or anything else.However, the "freedom to tinker" mindset which pervades the Android ecosystem might win out here. If the feature is available in tablets, it is likely only a matter of time before enterprising Android 4.2 hackers (and I mean hackers in the good sense of the word) find a way to enable the functionality on their handsets.

BERLIN â€” Angry Birds, the top-selling paid mobile app for the iPhone in the United States and Europe, has been downloaded more than a billion times by devoted game players around the world, who often spend hours slinging squawking fowl at groups of egg-stealing pigs.While regular players are familiar with the particular destructive qualities of certain of these birds, many are unaware of one facet: The game possesses a ravenous ability to collect personal information on its users.When Jason Hong, an associate professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, surveyed 40 users, all but two were unaware that the game was storing their locations so that they could later be the targets of ads.â€œWhen I am giving a talk about this, some people will pull out their smartphones while I am still speaking and erase the game,â€? Mr. Hong, an expert in mobile application privacy, said during an interview. â€œGenerally, most people are simply unaware of what is going on.â€?What is going on, according to experts, is that applications like Angry Birds and even more innocuous-seeming software, like that which turns your phone into a flashlight, defines words or delivers Bible quotes, are also collecting personal information, usually the userâ€™s location and sex and the unique identification number of a smartphone. But in some cases, they cull information from contact lists and pictures from photo libraries.As the Internet goes mobile, privacy issues surrounding phone apps have moved to the front lines of the debate over what information can be collected, when and by whom. Next year, more people around the world will gain access to the Internet through mobile phones or tablet computers than from desktop PCs, according to Gartner, the research group.The shift has brought consumers into a gray legal area, where existing privacy protections have failed to keep up with technology. The move to mobile has set off a debate between privacy advocates and online businesses, which consider the accumulation of personal information the backbone of an ad-driven Internet.In the United States, the data collection practices of app makers are loosely regulated, if at all; some do not even disclose what kind of data they are collecting and why. Last February, the California attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, reached an agreement with six leading operators of mobile application platforms that they would sell or distribute only mobile apps with privacy policies that consumers could review before downloading.In announcing the voluntary pact with Amazon, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Research in Motion, whose distribution platforms make up the bulk of the American mobile app market, Ms. Harris noted that most mobile apps came without privacy policies.â€œYour personal privacy should not be the cost of using mobile apps, but all too often it is,â€? Ms. Harris said at the time.But simple disclosure, in itself, is often insufficient.The makers of Angry Birds, Rovio Entertainment of Finland, discloses its information collection practices in a 3,358-word policy posted on its Web site. But as with most application makers around the world, the terms of Rovioâ€™s warnings are more of a disclaimer than a choice.The company advises consumers who do not want their data collected or ads directed at them to visit the Web site of its analytics firm, Flurry, and to list their details on two industry-sponsored Web sites. But Rovio notes that some companies do not honor the voluntary lists.As a last resort, Rovio cautions those who want to avoid data collection or ads simply to move on: â€œIf you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are not displayed to you, please do not use or access the services.â€?Despite multiple requests by phone and Internet over five days, Rovio did not respond to questions.Policy practices like Rovioâ€™s often do little to inform consumers. Most people simply click through privacy permissions without reading them, said Mr. Hong, the Carnegie Mellon professor. His institute is developing a software tool called App Scanner that aims to help consumers identify what types of information an application is collecting and for what likely purpose.In Europe, lawmakers in Brussels are planning to bring Web businesses for the first time under stringent data protection rules and to give consumers new legal powers, the better to control the information that is being collected on them.Proposed revisions to the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection regulation now before the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee of the European Parliament would require Web businesses to get explicit consent from consumers to collect data. A proposal would also give consumers the ability to choose what information an app can store on them without losing the ability to use the software.But the drafting of the revisions, which are not expected until late 2013 at the earliest, has set off a concerted lobbying battle by global technology companies, most of which are based in the United States, to weaken the consent requirements, which could undermine the advertising-financed business models that drive many free applications.

1 of 6.An automated train dumps ore in a sorting area after transporting it from thousands of meters underground at Vale's Copper Cliff mine near Sudbury, Ontario October 16, 2012.Once filled, the automated train will snake through a series of narrow tunnels, emerge from a rocky outcropping, then loop past St-Jean's window and dump its payload for sorting.Vale SA, the Brazilian company that owns the mine near this nickel-rich Canadian town, has spent nearly $50 million in two years to install and test the "rail-veyor." The company believes the transport system will revolutionize how it builds and extracts new mineral deposits.The equipment is made locally by Rail-Veyor Technologies Global Inc. It is one of many mining technologies that developers hope will allow future production to be run almost entirely by people safely above ground.Such advances may prove crucial as easy-to-exploit deposits run dry and miners drill deeper in more remote places to supply China, India and other emerging economies. The technology could make mining cheaper and safer, avoiding the need to dig wide tunnels and hire large numbers of expensive, skilled workers."As we go deeper, if we continue to apply existing thinking and existing technologies, it's a death spiral" for company profits, said Alex Henderson, who heads Vale's technology team in Sudbury."We need to begin to look at a step-change in mining rather than just incrementally improving our existing processes."The rail-veyor is one such step-change. At the test site, it has halved the time to build a mine, and Vale expects a 150 percent boost in production rates before year end.In Australia, Rio Tinto Ltd, one of the world's largest miners and an automation pioneer, is rolling out a fleet of self-driving trucks and trains at its iron ore operations. Vale, BHP Billiton and Chile's Codelco are in hot pursuit.Gold miner AngloGold Ashanti is eyeing automation in South Africa, where miners spend hours each shift traveling up and down shafts and ounces of gold are left behind in support pillars each year.Organized labor has made its peace with the automation drive, although there were some concerns that robots would displace humans."We're ok with automation, it's part of the changing times and it's a good thing for productivity," said Myles Sullivan of the United Steelworkers Canada, whose workers ended a year-long strike at Vale over bonuses and wages in 2010.New challenges in mining are driving technological changes. Large, accessible deposits have all but disappeared. Resources of tomorrow are in far-flung corners of the globe or hundreds of meters beneath the surface.Add a shortage of skilled labor - expected to worsen as the baby-boom generation retires - and mining costs have surged.While soaring demand means higher metal prices, rising costs are crimping profits. Canada's S&P/TSX Mining share index has fallen more than 38 percent since the beginning of 2011.Experts say mining companies must change how they operate.Making that shift is not easy for an industry steeped in tradition, especially when change doesn't come cheap. Rio Tinto is spending more than $500 million on train automation alone."This is a very conservative industry that has been very productive over the last 30 years doing it the way they're doing it now," said Douglas Morrison, chief executive of the Centre for Excellence in Mining Innovation (CEMI), an industry-funded research center in Sudbury."But is the old way going to work for us into the future? I think probably not, so we need to make some changes."After decades of production, the nickel mines around Sudbury are getting deeper and deeper. At Vale's Creighton mine, the No. 8 shaft drops nearly 8,000 feet into the ground - equivalent of a 700-story condo tower.At that depth it is very hot, around 50 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit), so tunnels must be pumped full of cooled air to make temperatures manageable for people and heavy machinery."The bigger issue is when we get much deeper we start to generate our own earthquakes - very small earthquakes - these are called 'rock bursts,'" said Morrison.Smaller tunnels and new ways of digging can hopefully reduce the danger of these rock bursts, which create a safety concern and slow development.Rio Tinto is working with CEMI on automated tunnel borers, currently used to build subway and sewer tunnels. By cutting through the rock instead of blasting, Rio aims to quadruple its underground advance rates to 20 meters a day.But while automated tunnel borers will build shafts and tunnels more quickly, massive mining equipment still handicaps the industry, which is where Vale's rail-veyor comes in.A train hauling 50 tonnes of ore uses a far smaller tunnel than a truck with the same load. By taking the massive trucks and scooptrams - large vehicles with shovels on the front - out of the equation, Vale can build more compact and stable tunnels.The rail-veyor, built on tracks that zig-zag down to the deposit, actually eliminates the need for expensive shafts and may eventually move people and equipment, along with ore.Vale's Henderson believes the technology - which the company plans to roll out in five upcoming projects - is a game-changer that will help usher in a new era of mining."Just as the scooptram was the key enabler for the mechanized era, is the rail-veyor a key enabler for the next?" he said.What that "next era" will look like is still up for debate. Some innovators believe robots will do most of the labor in mines of the future, as in automobile assembly plants. This would ease likely shortages in skilled labor in many countries.Over the next decade Canada's mining sector will need more than 100,000 skilled new hires to sustain even modest growth, according to the Mining Industry Human Resources Council.In Australia, the labor crunch is already so intense that truck drivers can make upwards of $100,000 a year, with turnover rates at some mines still near 40 percent."One of the biggest problems that the mining industry faces worldwide is trained personnel. We can't get them," said John Meech, director of CERM3, a mining research center at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver."One of the ways we are going to have to deal with that is to automate the systems so that the human becomes the supervisor, rather than the direct means of control."It is a concept already used at remote open-pit mines in Australia, where Rio's new fleet of driverless trucks can be run from a control room hundreds of miles away.Canada's Nautilus Minerals Inc is using automated rovers to explore the ocean bed for mineral deposits that underwater robots will eventually mine.In addition to boosting productivity, the advances will enhance safety. As labor leader Sullivan says, "so long as there's underground mining, there will be women and men working underground."Safety is the focus at a converted schoolyard just outside Sudbury, where a duo of mine rescue robots roll through a makeshift obstacle course. Their thick tires grind over logs and through mud pits.Designed by Canada's Penguin Automated Systems Inc, the equipment is being tested by Codelco at its Andina copper mine in Chile, doing dangerous jobs like checking stability after blasting and surveying tunnels at risk of flooding."Our mining industry is not quite there yet in Canada and it needs to get there to be competitive with the rest of the world," said Penguin Chief Executive Greg Baiden. "It comes back to the culture. Who wants to do it? Who wants to be first?"(Additional reporting by Bhaswati Mukhopadhyay in Bangalore; Editing by Frank McGurty, Janet Guttsman and David Gregorio)

Symantec provide overview and analysis of the year in global threat activity via its Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR) , with aÂ exclusiveÂ details that 400 million new variants of malware were created in 2011, which is an average of 33 million new variants of malware a month, or an average of one million new variants a day.."Â Symantec said in a blog post. Political activism and hacking were two big themes in 2011 themes that are continuing into 2012. There were many attacks last year that received lots of media attention. Hacking can undermine institutional confidence in a company, and loss of personal data can result in damage to an organizationâ€™s reputation.Also,Â Many companies are keen to adopt cloud computing. It can reduce costs by outsourcing routine services.Â The first risk is unmanaged employee use of cloud services. The proportion of phishing emails varied considerably by company size with the smallest and largest companies attracting the most, but the proportion of spam was almost identical for all sizes of business. The United States was the number one source of all activities, except for malicious code and spam zombies, where India took first place. Around 12.6% of bot activity originated in the USA as did 33.5% of web-based attacks, 16.7 % of network attacks and 48.5% of phishing websites.

A new class of electronics that are biocompatible and can dissolve completely in liquid mean that implantable medical treatments are closer to reality for on-the-go warfighters.DARPA researchers have created electronic systems and components using ultrathin sheets of silicon and magnesium encapsulated in silk, a biocompatible material. The thickness and crystallinity of the silk determines how long the electronics take to dissolve: days, hours, or even minutes. Silicon and magnesium are naturally occurring at low levels in the human body, and since the amount of material used in these devices is below physiological levels these electronics are biocompatible and eco-friendly.A paper appearing in the September 28, 2012 issue of Science explains how DARPA researchers were able to use this technology to create an implantable device that acts as a non-antibiotic, programmable bactericide that can dissolve harmlessly into the body to prevent surgical site infection. This is one driving example of biodegradable medical treatments for remote patient care that does not require extraction surgery while warfighters are deployed.â€œTransient electronics applied to localized antimicrobial therapy would be a major advance,â€? said Alicia Jackson, DARPA program manager for this effort. â€œA limitation of current implanted devices such as pacemakers and artificial joints is localized infection. Applying thin film appliquÃ©s to implant devices for localized surface heating and sterilization may help counter these infections, even when antibiotic resistant bacteria are present. Having means of eradicating infections could enhance the efficacy of many implant devices and ultimately reduce patient morbidity and mortality.â€?This work was funded by a study in the DARPA Microsystems Technology Office (MTO).

If you are running an open network, it is NOT the case that anyone can break into your computer, and you are still, by and large, in a safe situation. If you are running a separate â€œguestâ€? network apart from your primary network, you have no reason to worry. If you are running an open wireless network as your primary home network, it is important that you understand whether or not your network is set up to allow sharing, or if you can enable wireless isolation to create a firewall between users on the network so that sharing is not possible. If your network is set up to allow sharing, then you should be aware that users of your open network might be able to use devices that are attached to the network, e.g. printers, smart TVs, etc. Moreover, if your computer is set to share files over the network, those files will be accessible to anyone on your network. So if you are running an open network, and don't want strangers printing things or reading your network files, it is important to research whether you can disable sharing on your network, or to carefully check the sharing settings for each computer or device attached to the network.Understanding why open networks are generally safe for users requires a little more background. Websites and services that take security seriously use transport layer encryptionâ€”most notably Transport Layer Security (TLS), which underlies HTTPS. Using transport layer encryption is the gold standard for security. Since it encrypts data between your computer and the web service you are using, TLS provides a strong level of communication security whether or not you are on an open wireless network. It protects against snooping and attacks from anyone who can read the traffic passing between your computer and the website you are visiting, such as ISPs and governments as well as people on your local wireless network. The security gain from using HTTPS as much as possible is quite significant. This is why we encourage everyone to use our HTTPS Everywhere browser extension. On the other hand, WPA2 and other Wi-Fi security schemes protect only against an attacker on your local network, and provide only nominal protection. Very often, "securing" your wireless network will not be enough to thwart a determined attacker on your local network from being able to read and manipulate your data. Therefore, the security loss from moving to an open wireless network is less significant than you might realize, especially if you set up your network to firewall users from each otherâ€”as we recommend in our tutorialswhenever possible.

Four years after discovering that militants were tapping into drone video feeds, the U.S. military still hasnâ€™t secured the transmissions of more than half of its fleet of Predator and Reaper drones, Danger Room has learned.Â The majority of the aircraft still broadcast their classified video streams â€œin the clearâ€? â€” without encryption. With a minimal amount of equipment and know-how, militants can see what Americaâ€™s drones see.Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have become the single most important weapon in Americaâ€™s far-flung pursuit of violent extremists. Hundreds of American Predators and Reapers fly above Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan â€” watching suspected enemies, and striking them when necessary.Â Nearly 3,000 people have been killedÂ in the decade-long drone campaign.â€œIf somebody could obtain reliable access to real-time Predator or Reaper video â€” without attribution or alerting U.S. military â€” that would Â a tremendous intel coup,â€? says Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. â€œThere is an insatiable demand from Predator and Reaper imagery in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Any reluctance to use those for spying or missile strikes places operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia at some risk.â€?Military officials have known about â€” and mostly shrugged off â€” the vulnerability since the development of the Predator in the 1990s. But the problem drew increased attentionÂ in 2008, when drone video footage was found on the laptops of Shiâ€™ite militants in Iraq, who were able to intercept the feed using a piece of $26 software. The Pentagon and the defense industry assured the public that theyâ€™d close the hole by retrofitting the robotic aircraft with new communications protocols and encrypted transceivers that would keep the video from being intercepted again.Four years into the effort, however, only â€œ30 to 50 percentâ€? of Americaâ€™s Predators and Reapers are using fully encrypted transmissions, a source familiar with the retrofitting effort tells Danger Room. The total fleet wonâ€™t see its communications secured until 2014. This source and others who work closely with drone operations say that drones flying overseas are among the first to get the newly secured equipment. They also noted that they are unaware of any incidents of militants using Americaâ€™s unmanned eyes in the sky to their advantage. â€œBut Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t,â€? the source adds. â€œAnd that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not happening.â€?This isnâ€™t the only vulnerability in the drone fleet. In March of 2011, an unknown software glitch caused a PredatorÂ stationed at a U.S. base inÂ Africa toÂ start its engine without human direction.Â Last October, as Danger Room first reported, Air Force technicians discovered aÂ virus infecting the dronesâ€™ remote cockpitsÂ in Las Vegas. It tookÂ weeks of sustained effortÂ to clean up the machines. The aircraft, which rely on GPS to guide them through the air, can run into problems if GPS signals are jammed in a particular area â€” something that can be done with cheap, commercially available hardware.Â Iranian officials claimed they hacked the GPS control signal of an advanced drone, though itâ€™sÂ impossible to verify that lofty claim.No one who works with UAVs is questioning the fundamental integrity of the drone fleet at the moment; it would take an incredibly sophisticated hacker toÂ commandeerÂ a Predator, for example. Nor is anyone pretending that this premiere tool of the U.S.global Â counterterror campaign is flawless.Predators and the larger, better-armed Reapers transmit video and accept instructions in one of two ways. The first is via satellite, to remote pilots and sensor operators who are often on the other side of the planet; these satellite communications are encrypted, and are generally considered secure.The second is through a radio frequency signal called the Common Data Link, which is used to share the droneâ€™s video feed with troops on the ground. The CDLâ€™s carrier signal â€” its specific pattern of frequencies, in a given order and for a given length of time â€” tells both transmitter and receiver on how to function. The problem is that the Predatorsâ€™ version of the CDL carrier signal (also known as a â€œwaveformâ€?) didnâ€™t include an order to encrypt the signal. So neither the transmitter on the drone nor the receivers that troops used on the ground employed encryption, either.There were reasons for this.Â The original Predator, just 27 feet long, was little more than a scaled-up model plane with an 85-horsepower engine. It had a payload of just half a ton for all its fuel, cameras and radios. And encryption systems can be heavy. (Big crypto boxesÂ are a major reasonÂ the Armyâ€™s futuristic universal radio ended up being too bulky for combat, for example.) With the early Predator models, the Air Force made the conscious decision to leave off the crypto.The flying branch was well aware of the risk. â€œDepending on the theater of operation and hostile electronic combat systems present, the threat to the UAVs could range from negligible with only a potential of signal intercept for detection purpose, to an active jamming effort made against an operating, unencrypted UAV,â€?Â the Air Force reported in 1996.Â â€?The link characteristics of the baseline Predator system could be vulnerable to corruption of down links data or hostile data insertions.â€?The Predator models steadily grew in power and payload, and took a big leap in dimensions and capability with the 36-foot-long Reaper version introduced in 2007. The Reaper has a 950-horsepower engine and a nearly 4,000-pound payload â€” more than enough capacity for crypto-enabled systems which, like all electronics, had shrunk in size and weight.The problem was that, by then, the military had rushed to the battlefield hundreds ofÂ Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receivers, orÂ RoversÂ â€“ rugged, laptop-sized receivers with screens for watching drone footage. And those early version of the Rovers were developed and distributed so fast, the military once again left the crypto off. â€œIt could be both intercepted (e.g., hacked into) and jammed,â€? e-mails an Air Force officer with knowledge of the program.Which mean the Pentagon was stuck, for a time. The military couldnâ€™t replace the old CDL waveform with something encryptable until the Rovers â€” and the radio transmitters aboard the Predators â€” could handle such a signal.Eventually, the Rovers began to be swapped out for newer models. The latest version, the â€œTactical Rover,â€? (.pdf) is about the size of an old-school mobile phone. It can use both the Advanced Encryption Standard an the triple-Data Encryption Standard to secure video feeds. There are now about a thousand of the units in the militaryâ€™s hands.And now, the Predators and Reapers are starting to get enhanced radios, too. â€œThe fleet-wide upgrade begins later this year and carries on for several years,â€? says Maj. Mary Danner-Jones, an Air Force spokesperson. The service is spending $12 million on crypto-enabled Vortex transceivers (.pdf).Thatâ€™s allowing a new, hardened waveform to be introduced throughout the Predator and Reaper fleet. The Air Force recently gave Predator-maker General Atomics Aeronautical SystemsÂ a $26 million contract to retrofit its drone cockpits to accept the carrier signal, among other enhancements.The question is why hasnâ€™t this happened sooner. After all,Â the Navy installed multiple layers of encryption inÂ theirÂ â€™bots some time ago. Navy spokesman Jamie Cosgrove tells Danger Room that â€œthe vast majorityâ€? of naval drones are encrypted â€“Â  â€œand have been since development.â€?One source who works on developing Navy UAVs, but is not authorized the speak on the record, explains why:Â â€?Standard unencrypted video is basically a broadcast to whoever can figure out the right carrier frequency, so essentially, we are simulcasting to battlefield commanders and the opposing force. If that opposing force knows we can see them and from where, they can take better evasive maneuvers.â€?Itâ€™s possible that none of the militants America is trying today are as sophisticated as the ones who intercepted that drone video in 2008. Itâ€™s possible that the value of such footage-from-above is so fleeting that extremists have never again bothered to grab it. But itâ€™s worth noting that Predator and Reaper video is considered by the U.S. military to be classified information. And when U.S. commanders on the ground get into a firefight, the first call they usually make is for a drone, so they can take a look at the battlefield through the eyes of a drone.

The Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory has today unveiled its new supercomputer Titan, claimed to be the world's most powerful system.The Cray XK7 system's 20 petaflops of power will be put to use researching climate change and other data-intensive tasks.It contains 18,688 nodes, each based around a 16-core AMD Opteron 6274 processor and an NVIDIA Tesla K20 graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerator, and has more than 700 terabytes of memory.The combination of traditional central processing units and more recent GPUs means Titan occupies the same amount of space as its Jaguar predecessor and uses only marginally more electricity."One challenge in supercomputers today is power consumption," says Jeff Nichols, associate laboratory director for computing and computational sciences."Combining GPUs and CPUs in a single system requires less power than CPUs alone and is a responsible move toward lowering our carbon footprint. Titan will provide unprecedented computing power for research in energy, climate change, materials and other disciplines to enable scientific leadership."Because they handle hundreds of calculations simultaneously, GPUs can get through a lot more work than CPUs in a given time. While the 299,008 CPU cores guide simulations, the new NVIDIA GPUs do the 'heavy lifting',Â  allowing scientific calculations to be run with greater speed and accuracy."Titan will allow scientists to simulate physical systems more realistically and in far greater detail," says James Hack, director of ORNL's National Center for Computational Sciences."The improvements in simulation fidelity will accelerate progress in a wide range of research areas such as alternative energy and energy efficiency, the identification and development of novel and useful materials and the opportunity for more advanced climate projections."The system will be used for several different applications, including a nanoscale analysis of important materials such as steels, iron-nickel alloys and advanced permanent magnets that will help drive future electric motors and generators.Titan will also allow researchers to model large-molecule hydrocarbon fuels such as the gasoline surrogate isooctane; commercially important oxygenated alcohols such as ethanol and butanol; and biofuel surrogates that blend methyl butanoate, methyl decanoate and n-heptane.|Meanwhile, the Denovo application will model the behavior of neutrons in a nuclear power reactor, simulating a fuel rod through one round of use in a reactor core in 13 hours - a job that took 60 hours on the Jaguar system.Its most important task, though, is to simulate long-term global climate, enabling researchers to better understand future air quality as well as the effect of particles suspended in the air."As scientists are asked to answer not only whether the climate is changing but where and how, the workload for global climate models must grow dramatically," says Kate Evans of ORNL. "Titan will help us address the complexity that will be required in such models." Â

Huge news out of Apple today, as its senior vice president of iOS software, Scott Forstall, will leave the company next year after putting in some 15 years. Furthermore, John Browett -- head of Apple retail -- is also on his way out. The memo was delivered late today, on a day that is littered with other news that the company may hope will bury the bulk of it -- and, on a day where trading on the New York Stock Exchange is halted due to Hurricane Sandy. It's practically a given that Forstall is taking the brunt of the impact from its decision to forge ahead with an obviously subpar Maps application, all while trumpeting it as one of the pillars of iOS 6 during his keynote speech at WWDC 2012. The introduction of Siri as a beta product is also on Forstall, and we all know what happens to executives who flub something related to iPhone....As the shakeup unfolds, Jony Ive, Bob Mansfield, Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi will add more responsibilities to their roles. In other words, Tim Cook isn't about to usher in new help who may thwart the company's efforts to continue at its breakneck pace. Curiously, Mansfield will be heaping more on his own plate just months after he had originally planned to retire. As for Ive? He'll be responsible for providing "leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design." Eddy Cue will be burdened with Siri and Maps, while also keeping an eye on the iTunes Store, the App Store, the iBookstore and iCloud. Needless to say, he probably won't be seeing too many walls outside of Cupertino for the foreseeable future. Federighi is being tasked to lead both iOS and OS X, while Mansfield chairs a new Technologies group that bundles Apple's wireless teams across the company. (Of note, Dan Riccio -- who was scheduled to take over for Mansfield prior to his retirement retraction -- isn't among those who are gaining duties.)Just months after Browett was brought in from Dixons in order to lead up Apple's retail efforts, he's on the outs as well. Of course, he's also responsible for the branch having to tell stores that it "messed up" when he fiddled with staffing levels back in August. A search for a new head of Retail is underway and in the interim, the Retail team will report directly to CEO Tim Cook.Update: The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Forstall was asked to resign after refusing to sign his own name to Apple's Maps apology, leaving Tim Cook to sign his name instead. Yikes.Apple Announces Changes to Increase Collaboration Across Hardware, Software & Services Jony Ive, Bob Mansfield, Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi Add Responsibilities to Their Roles CUPERTINO, California-October 29, 2012-AppleÂ® today announced executive management changes that will encourage even more collaboration between the Company's world-class hardware, software and services teams. As part of these changes, Jony Ive, Bob Mansfield, Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi will add more responsibilities to their roles. Apple also announced that Scott Forstall will be leaving Apple next year and will serve as an advisor to CEO Tim Cook in the interim. "We are in one of the most prolific periods of innovation and new products in Apple's history," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "The amazing products that we've introduced in September and October, iPhone 5, iOS 6, iPad mini, iPad, iMac, MacBook Pro, iPod touch, iPod nano and many of our applications, could only have been created at Apple and are the direct result of our relentless focus on tightly integrating world-class hardware, software and services." Jony Ive will provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design. His incredible design aesthetic has been the driving force behind the look and feel of Apple's products for more than a decade. Eddy Cue will take on the additional responsibility of SiriÂ® and Maps, placing all of our online services in one group. This organization has overseen major successes such as the iTunes StoreÂ®, the App Storeâ„ , the iBookstoreâ„  and iCloudÂ®. This group has an excellent track record of building and strengthening Apple's online services to meet and exceed the high expectations of our customers. Craig Federighi will lead both iOS and OS XÂ®. Apple has the most advanced mobile and desktop operating systems, and this move brings together the OS teams to make it even easier to deliver the best technology and user experience innovations to both platforms. Bob Mansfield will lead a new group, Technologies, which combines all of Apple's wireless teams across the company in one organization, fostering innovation in this area at an even higher level. This organization will also include the semiconductor teams, who have ambitious plans for the future. Additionally, John Browett is leaving Apple. A search for a new head of Retail is underway and in the interim, the Retail team will report directly to Tim Cook. Apple's Retail organization has an incredibly strong network of leaders at the store and regional level who will continue the excellent work that has been done over the past decade to revolutionize retailing with unique, innovative services for customers. Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.

Want to play old school Nintendo games on your iPad? Download Google Play apps from foreign countries to your Galaxy Tab? If so, you'll have to break the law. That's because under new rules issued by the U.S. government, jailbreaking (or in the case of Android, rooting) tablets becomes a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act on Sunday, October 28. On Thursday, the Librarian of Congress issued its latest set of exemptions to the DMCA. By default, digital rights management (DRM) mechanisms cannot legally be flouted by consumers, but the DMCA allows the government to periodically define exemptions to this rule. In 2010, tinker-happy iPhone owners breathed a sigh of relief (and Steve Jobs likely just sighed) when it was ruled that jailbreaking smartphones was perfectly legal under the DMCA. This remains the case, but the updated list of exemptions explicitly excludes tablets, a category of devices that the government found to be too "broad and ill-defined" to allow their owners free reign when using them. So as of now, it is illegal to jailbreak an iPad or root a tablet running Android or any tablet-focused flavor of Windows. This Makes No SenseThe tablet exemption is a bit of a head scratcher. I'm free to jailbreak my iPhone and do as I please with it, but if I want to run the same jailbreak tool on a larger device running the same exact operating system, it's against the law?Accessing Cydia on my iPhone 4 is cool, but doing it on a screen a few inches bigger? That's illegal. Other than its size, the only significant difference between these two devices is that the iPhone makes and receives calls. The new rules also forbid personal copying of DVDs. And starting in January 2013, it will be illegal to unlock new smartphones for the purpose of switching carriers. Unlocking older handsets will continue to be fine. The whole thing illustrates what Ars Technica's Timothy B. Lee calls "the fundamentally arbitrary nature of the DMCA's exemption process."Explains Lee: In order to convince the Librarian to allow DVD ripping in order to watch it on an iPad, a court would first need to rule that doing so falls under copyright's fair use defense. To get such a ruling, someone would have to rip a DVD (or sell a DVD-ripping tool), get sued in court, and then convince a judge that DVD ripping is fair use. But in such a case, the courts would probably never reach the fair use question, because - absent an exemption from the Librarian of Congress- circumvention is illegal whether or not the underlying use of the work would be a fair use.Lee goes on to make the case that new rules surrounding DVD copying and eBook DRM don't make sense either and suggests that perhaps DRM schemes should not be legally protected from tampering by default. His take is well worth a read. How Will This Impact iOS Jailbreaking? When the news broke, iOS jailbreak developer MuscleNerd expressed concern about it on Twitter. When I asked him for his perspective, he declined to comment because of potential legal repercussions.

SAN FRANCISCO â€” I.B.M. scientists are reporting progress in a chip-making technology that is likely to ensure that the basic digital switch at the heart of modern microchips will continue to shrink for more than a decade.The advance, first described in the journal Nature Nanotechnology on Sunday, is based on carbon nanotubes â€” exotic molecules that have long held out promise as an alternative to silicon from which to create the tiny logic gates now used by the billions to create microprocessors and memory chips.The I.B.M. scientists at the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., have been able to pattern an array of carbon nanotubes on the surface of a silicon wafer and use them to build hybrid chips with more than 10,000 working transistors.Against all expectations, silicon-based chips have continued to improve in speed and capacity for the last five decades. In recent years, however, there has been growing uncertainty about whether the technology would continue to improve.A failure to increase performance would inevitably stall a growing array of industries that have fed off the falling cost of computer chips.Chip makers have routinely doubled the number of transistors that can be etched on the surface of silicon wafers by shrinking the size of the tiny switches that store and route the ones and zeros that are processed by digital computers.The switches are rapidly approaching dimensions that can be measured in terms of the widths of just a few atoms.The process known as Mooreâ€™s Law was named after Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, who in 1965 noted that the industry was doubling the number of transistors it could build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years.To maintain that rate of progress, semiconductor engineers have had to consistently perfect a range of related manufacturing systems and materials that continue to perform at evermore Lilliputian scale.The I.B.M. advance is significant, scientists said, because the chip-making industry has not yet found a way forward beyond the next two or three generations of silicon.â€œThis is terrific. Iâ€™m really excited about this,â€? said Subhasish Mitra, an electrical engineering professor at Stanford who specializes in carbon nanotube materials.The promise of the new materials is twofold, he said: carbon nanotubes will allow chip makers to build smaller transistors while also probably increasing the speed at which they can be turned on and off.In recent years, while chip makers have continued to double the number of transistors on chips, their performance, measured as â€œclock speed,â€? has largely stalled.This has required the computer industry to change its designs and begin building more so-called parallel computers. Today, even smartphone microprocessors come with as many as four processors, or â€œcores,â€? which are used to break up tasks so they can be processed simultaneously.I.B.M. scientists say they believe that once they have perfected the use of carbon nanotubes â€” sometime after the end of this decade â€” it will be possible to sharply increase the speed of chips while continuing to sharply increase the number of transistors.This year, I.B.M. researchers published a separate paper describing the speedup made possible by carbon nanotubes.â€œThese devices outperformed any other switches made from any other material,â€? said Supratik Guha, director of physical sciences at I.B.M.â€™s Yorktown Heights research center. â€œWe had suspected this all along, and our device physicists had simulated this, and they showed that we would see a factor of five or more performance improvement over conventional silicon devices.â€?Carbon nanotubes are one of three promising technologies engineers hope will be perfected in time to keep the industry on its Mooreâ€™s Law pace. Graphene is another promising material that is being explored, as well as a variant of the standard silicon transistor known as a tunneling field-effect transistor.Dr. Guha, however, said carbon nanotube materials had more promising performance characteristics and that I.B.M. physicists and chemists had perfected a range of â€œtricksâ€? to ease the manufacturing process.Carbon nanotubes are essentially single sheets of carbon rolled into tubes. In the Nature Nanotechnology paper, the I.B.M. researchers described how they were able to place ultrasmall rectangles of the material in regular arrays by placing them in a soapy mixture to make them soluble in water. They used a process they described as â€œchemical self-assemblyâ€? to create patterned arrays in which nanotubes stick in some areas of the surface while leaving other areas untouched.Perfecting the process will require a more highly purified form of the carbon nanotube material, Dr. Guha said, explaining that less pure forms are metallic and are not good semiconductors.Dr. Guha said that in the 1940s scientists at Bell Labs had discovered ways to purify germanium, a metal in the carbon group that is chemically similar to silicon, to make the first transistors. He said he was confident that I.B.M. scientists would be able to make 99.99 percent pure carbon nanotubes in the future.This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about an I.B.M. breakthrough on chip design defined incorrectly Mooreâ€™s Law, an observation on technology advances named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel. Mooreâ€™s Law holds that the chip industry doubles the number of transistors it can build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years â€” not intervals of about 12 to 18 months.

Picture an eerily human-like tangle of metal, wiring and lights, cables dangling from somewhere above like puppet strings. Imagine it springing to life, lifting a long, lanky leg that bends 180 degrees at the hips like the eerie biomechanical GekkoÂ inÂ Metal Gear Solid 4, then placing one foot on a high bench and flexing its ankle, probing, testing, as it leans its thick cage of a torso forward, its arms splayed against plastic and wood walls on either side.And then itâ€™s up, hoisting its bulk into the air, its arms swinging forward just as yours or mine would, finding its feet, gently quaking, balancing.Now picture it leaping back down, landing first one foot, then the other, making a thunderous sound like someone swinging a sledgehammer at sheet metal (or the noise youâ€™d imagine a hulking robot might generate as it falls from above, like a BattleTech mech).Next â€” and you can see all this and more in the video above â€” itâ€™ll straddle a shallow pit teeming with deadly lizards and snakes (okay, just rubber ones, but still scary!) using both legs, edging past the gap fluidlyâ€¦Meet Pet-Proto, a Boston Dynamics-designed bipedal robot, related to the companyâ€™s anthropomorphic PETMAN project.Â Itâ€™s capable of analyzing and navigating complex obstacle courses, making decisions autonomously, and with, if not the actual dexterity of a human being, at least the functional semblance of one.Itâ€™s all part of DARPAâ€˜s (Defense Advance Research Projects Agency) work to promote its ambitious DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), which initiated its second phase on Wednesday, Oct. 24 since launching back in April. The contest will test the sort of capabilities illustrated above and others â€œinÂ a series of tasks that will simulate conditions in a dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environment.â€?â€œRobot enthusiasts, the time has come,â€? says DARPA on its website. â€œThe DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) begins today. Will you be part of it?â€?Itâ€™s just the start of whatâ€™ll amount to a two-year ordeal for teams competing to design, tweak and test rescue either humanoid or non-humanoid robots: ultra-agile, durable mechanical servants capable of going where most humans wouldnâ€™t dare, say exploring collapsed mines and helping to rescue trapped miners, defusing improvised explosive devices, or working around nuclear meltdown incidents like Fukushima, Chernobyl or Three Mile Island.The prize? A cool $2 million. All teams have to do is create robots that can perform tasks like: drive a utility vehicle, climb a wobbly industrial ladder, shatter a concrete wall using a power tool, cross a debris-littered field, isolate and close a valve in a leaking pipe and replace industrial equipment. Simple, right?If youâ€™re from the future, maybe, but todayâ€™s robots do almost none of these things â€” ergo DARPAâ€™s two-year challenge, designed to make some or all of the above a reality, and which as of Wednesday just got even more interesting.Take the newly announced Track C, which allows participants to compete without touching actual machine parts. Itâ€™ll involve using something DARPA calls its â€œDRC Simulator,â€? an open-source, cloud-based robotics design tool, and all you need to work it is a little software development know-how and an appetite for robotic simulation.â€œThe DRC Simulator is going to be one of DARPAâ€™s legacies to the robotics community,â€? says DRC program managerÂ Gill Pratt. â€œOne of DARPAâ€™s goals for the Challenge is to catalyze robotics development across all fields so that we as a community end up with more capable, more affordable robots that are easier to operate. The value of a cloud-based simulator is that it gives talent from any location a common space to train, design, test and collaborate on ideas without the need for expensive hardware and prototyping. That opens the door to innovation.â€?The DRC Simulator has only been in development for a month, according to DARPA, and its future already sounds bright, with a melange of improvements in the offing, including new â€œmodels of robots, perception sensors and field environmentsâ€? that should ultimately allow the simulator to â€œfunction as a cloud-based, real-time, operator-interactive virtual test bed that uses physics-based models of inertia, actuation, contact and environment dynamics.â€?What about Pet-Proto? As its name suggests, itâ€™s just a prototype â€” part of how DARPAâ€™s promoting the contest. Pet-Proto is really a predecessor to something theoretically more sophisticated that Boston Dynamics is working on, dubbed â€œAtlas.â€?DARPA says challenge participants selected to advance will receive Government Funded Equipment (GFE) â€œin the form of a modified robot platform based on the Atlas robot.â€? In other words, if you make it through the initial hurdles, you get to play with (and work on) something likeÂ that.

New technology has allowed researchers to come closer than ever to cracking the worldâ€™s oldest undeciphered writing system.Researchers from the University of Oxford and the University of Southampton have developed a Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) System for Ancient Documentary Artefacts (funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation) to capture images of some of the worldâ€™s most important historical documents. Recently this system was used on objects held in the vaults of the Louvre Museum in Paris.These images have now been made available online for free public access on the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative website.Among the documents are manuscripts written in the so-called proto-Elamite writing system used in ancient Iran from 3,200 to 3,000 BC and which is the oldest undeciphered writing system currently known. By viewing extremely high quality images of these documents, and by sharing them with a community of scholars worldwide, the Oxford University team hope to crack the code once and for all.Dr Jacob Dahl, a co-leader of the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative and a member of Oxford Universityâ€™s Faculty of Oriental Studies, said: 'I have spent the last ten years trying to decipher the proto-Elamite writing system and, with this new technology, I think we are finally on the point of making a breakthrough.'The quality of the images captured is incredible. And it is important to remember that you cannot decipher a writing system without having reliable images because you will, for example, overlook differences barely visible to the naked eye which may have meaning. Consider for example not being able to distinguish the letter i from the letter t.'The reflectance transformation imaging technology system designed by staff in the Archaeological Computing Research Group and Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton comprises a dome with 76 lights and a camera positioned at the top of the dome. The manuscript is placed in the centre of the dome, whereafter 76 photos are taken each with one of the 76 lights individually lit. In post-processing the 76 images are joined so that the researcher can move the light across the surface of the digital image and use the difference between light and shadow to highlight never-before-seen details.'We have never been able to view documents in this quality before,' Dr Dahl explained.Dr Dahl believes this writing system might be even more interesting than previously thought. He said: 'Looking at contemporary and later writing systems, we would expect to see proto-Elamite use only symbols to represent things, but we think they also used a syllabary â€“ for example 'cat' would not be represented by a symbol depicting the animal but by symbols for the otherwise unrelated words 'ca' and 'at'.'Half of the signs used in this way seem to have been invented ex novo for the sounds they represent â€“ if this turns out to be the case, it would transform fundamentally how we understand early writing where phonetecism is believed to have been developed through the so-called rebus principle (a modern example would be for example "I see you", written with the three signs 'eye', the 'sea', and a 'ewe').'Some features of the writing system are already known. The scribes had loaned - or potentially shared - some signs from/with Mesopotamia, such asÂ  the numerical signs and their systemsÂ  and signs for objects like sheep, goats, cereals and some others. Nevertheless, 80-90% of the signs remain undeciphered.The writing system died out after only a couple centuries. Dr Dahl said: 'It was used in administration and for agricultural records but it was not used in schools â€“ the lack of a scholarly tradition meant that a lot of mistakes were made and the writing system may eventually have become useless as an administrative system. Eventually, the system was abandoned after some two hundred years.'Dr Dahl joked: 'This is probably the worldâ€™s first case of a collapse of knowledge because of the under-funding of education!'The Louvre gave the researchers access to the c. 1100 proto-Elamite tablets in its collections, half of which can now be viewed on the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative website.Dr Dahl said: 'The Louvre collection of early writing from Mesopotamia and Iran is incredibly important â€“ it contains the first substantial law code, the first record of a battle between kings, the first propaganda, and the first literature. Being able to put these documents online would be a great achievement.'Dr Dahl said making important documents from early human history publicly accessible is becoming increasingly important, both as a consequence of the ever-expanding influence of cyberscholarship in academic research, but also in many cases more pressingly as a matter of cultural heritage preservation in areas of the world threatened by armed conflict and collapse of security.'Iraqâ€™s cultural heritage has been pillaged in the last 20 years, and the situation in neighbouring Syria is looking dire as well,' he said.

Nuclear reactors in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are being monitored for potential impacts by Hurricane Sandy, a Category 1 storm that may strike anywhere from Delaware to southern New England.â€œBecause of the size of it, we could see an impact to coastal and inland plants,â€? Neil Sheehan, a spokesman based in Philadelphia for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said by phone today. â€œWe will station inspectors at the sites if we know they could be directly impacted.â€?The NRC met earlier today to discuss the necessary precautions to take for the storm, Sheehan said. Plants must begin to shut if wind speeds exceed certain limits, he said.As of 2 p.m. New York time, Sandy had winds of 75 miles (121 kilometers) per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was about 430 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, moving north at 7 mph.The current Hurricane Center track calls for the system to come ashore just south of Delaware Bay on Oct. 30.Contingency Plans Nuclear plants in the projected path of the hurricane include North Anna and Surry in Virginia, Calvert Cliffs in Maryland, Hope Creek and Salem in New Jersey, Indian Point in New York and Millstone in Connecticut. The NRC is considering enhancing inspector coverage of these reactors, Sheehan said in an e-mail today.Public Service Enterprise Group must shut all units at the Salem and Hope Creek plants two hours before the onset of hurricane-force winds greater than 74 mph, according to Sheehan. An â€œunusual eventâ€? would be declared if the winds are sustained for greater than 15 minutes or if the water level reaches 99.5 feet or higher, he said. Such an event is the lowest of four level of emergency used by the commission.Salem Unit 2 is currently shut for refueling, while Unit 1 was operating at 83 percent of capacity today during maintenance on the circulating water system. Hope Creek ran at full power. The three units have a combined capacity of 3,365 megawatts.â€œWe are in phase one of our severe-weather plan,â€? Joe Delmar, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail responding to questions. â€œThis includes inspecting, removing and securing outside areas for potential missiles, objects that could go airborne, and staging of emergency equipment and supplies.â€?Millstone Reactor Nuclear generation in the Northeastern region dropped 1.1 percent to 18,016 megawatts, with seven plants shut, an NRC report today showed.Dominion Resourcesâ€™s Millstone plant is monitoring Sandyâ€™s progress and preparing to adjust staff as it comes closer, according to Ken Holt, a plant spokesman based in Richmond, Virginia. The plant must shut if winds reach 90 mph.â€œWe would shut down in advance of the storm if they were expected to be 90 miles per hour at the site,â€? Holt said by phone today. â€œFloods and high winds are a threat because they can knock off off-site power and weâ€™d then need to activate emergency generators for power to put the plant to safe conditions.â€?

A recent update to the Xbox 360 dashboard made Internet Explorer available as a free download. This is exciting news for an HTML5 game company like us, as it means that our games are now playable on Xbox 360 consoles.In an interview with ImpactJS creator Dominic Szablewski, we talked about some of the developer frustrations revolving around Microsoft and HTML5. Dominic has his game Biolab Disaster running natively on an Xbox 360, but at a completely unplayable 3 frames per second. Itâ€™s so close to working but thereâ€™s no apparent interest from Microsoft to seal the deal, despite their repeated pushes into the HTML5 game space.Microsoft has financed or otherwise produced a handful of HTML5 game projects in the past few years, including Pirates Love Daisies, Agent 008 Ball, Cut the Rope, and most recently the apparent game platform Atari Arcade.These projects are beneficial to the HTML5 game development scene and weâ€™re glad Microsoft has sponsored them, but it does contrast the decidedly lackluster support for HTML5 on its Xbox 360 consoles.The release of Internet Explorer on Xbox 360 is a step in the right direction. Hopefully someday youâ€™ll see our HTML5 games running natively via XBIG, but in the meantime, why not fire up Internet Explorer?First, download Internet Explorer onto your console. Then, open Internet Explorer and navigate it to arcade.lostdecadegames.com. Once there, it should look like this:First, I recommend a quick game of Onslaught! Defense. I played a game and happily got my highest score ever! Fair warning, there is some awkwardness with the controls: youâ€™ll need to move Internet Explorerâ€™s cursor to the directional slider at the bottom of the screen. Hold down the A button and you should be able to control the character.Onslaught! Defense isnâ€™t a terribly deep game, so next up how about some Lunch Bug? It feels best with a touch or click interface, but Internet Explorerâ€™s cursor is good enough. Of course, like in many other browsers, the sound playback is buggy and unreliable, but the game runs pretty smoothly and the graphics look great on a big TV.I think youâ€™ll agree that the games show a lot of potential, but there are plenty of issues that would be largely solved by a native wrapper. For example, the audio in Lunch Bug is pretty bad in desktop and mobile browsers, but sounds great in the native Android version.So this is really exciting and awesome, but our question is: will we get native HTML5 games on Xbox 360, or will we have to wait for the next generation of consoles? If someone at Microsoft happens to read this, please do get in touch.

We've been following the core media appsâ€”Music and Videoâ€”since the Windows 8 Consumer Preview. That development hinted Microsoft wanted to become a viable competitor to Apple and Amazon in the multimedia content realm. We found the first glimpse compelling, a signal that perhaps there was a true stake for Redmond to claim.Now with Windows 8 live, the Preview groundwork has been built upon. As you'll see here, things have changed, but not always as expected. The evolution of Music and Video begins up front, where the apps have shed their Zune branding. Instead, Microsoft choseÂ to reuse the Xbox brand, as the company moves to expand the scope of the Xbox name from gaming to allÂ media and entertainment.The Music and Video applications are close siblings. Aside from the obvious difference implied by their names, their structure and organization are essentially identical.In both apps, the first/main screen is dominated by Microsoft's attempts to sell to you. Users are greeted by a mix of promotional areas that highlight "hot" artists or movies, and entryways into the music, movie, and TV stores. Your own media are hidden out of view to the left.Drill into your media, and you get simple browsing. For videos you get a bunch of thumbnails, and the ability to filter the visible videos according to whether they're films, TV shows, or other. (I don't know what it uses to make this distinction because all my videos appear as "other." There doesn't appear to be a way within the application to change that.)The layout is also terribly unscalable. The only option is to see some moderately large thumbnails in a list that scrolls left to right. That's OK if you have a few dozen videos; it's practically worthless if you have any more. It's just too hard to find what you want.In music, you get a spreadsheet-type view with the option to group by song, artist, or album. The most notable bit about this spreadsheet view is just how extraordinarily slow it is. Scroll too fast and you'll just see a blank great space where songs should be listed. A few seconds later it'll manage to populate itself. This slowness, combined with the lack of any apparent "fast scroll" mechanism (such as iOS's ability to scroll down the right edge) makes browsing and selecting files a tedious experience.Songs and albums can be selected by right clicking them or nudging them sideways, allowing group operations such as adding them to a playlist, to the Now Playing pseudo-playlist, or deleting them. Adding to playlists is a little glitchy. There are actually two buttons to add to playlists; one that adds to a new playlist, and one that adds to the last playlist you modified. This is a good idea, but I found the Music app was slow to notice when I'd changed to modifying a different playlist. For example, if I first edit playlist A and then edit playlist B, the "add" button would still show playlist A's name... and then a few seconds later change to playlist B.Like Windows Media Player, Music's Now Playing pseudo-playlist is maintained independently of your current view of the song spreadsheet. This is in contrast to iOS, where changing the sort order of the song list while browsing is also prone to changing the playback order. I prefer this approach, but its implementation in Music seems to leave a lot to be desired. Although it is easy to see what the Now Playing list is, I can't find any facility for actually changing it. Decide that you want to get rid of one of the songs you've cued up? Want to swap them around? For the life of me, I couldn't tell you how (if it's even possible to do at all). This feels like such a glaring oversight that I'm sure I must be missing something.Overall, I feel there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the basic presentation. With a bit of care and attention it could work well, but it's just not there yet.One smart feature: when Music is playing, the volume popup that appears when you use the hardware volume keys also includes playback controls and album art. It's a nice touch.One not at all smart feature: the play/pause key on keyboards with media keys doesn't control playback of the Music app. Want to quickly pause playback to take a phone call? You'll have to go into the app to do it.

The main way for people to begin downloading content from BitTorrent is to visit one of the Internetâ€™s many hundreds of torrent sites. There they can download either .torrent files or, in the case of The Pirate Bay, magnet links. This week it became possible to go on a YouTube-like â€œrelated videoâ€? journey through BitTorrentâ€™s Distributed Hash Table to find similar content to that being already downloaded, all without visiting a torrent site.Visiting a torrent site to access content is a fairly simple affair. Select the URL, go to the site and type whatever youâ€™re looking for into the search box.However, if a BitTorrent user doesnâ€™t really know what he or she is looking for and needs some ideas, a torrent siteâ€™s category view comes in useful to allow browsing of specific content such as videos, music or games.But what if there was another mechanism through which to find new content, one that doesnâ€™t involve visiting a torrent site? One that would find content to download based on the activities of other BitTorrent users that have downloaded, to some extent, the same or similar content as you?Now all of that is possible with â€œSwarm Discoveriesâ€?, a new and intriguing feature added to the open source Vuze client this week. The feature uses the Vuze Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to anonymously relate one piece of downloaded content with another.â€œFor a long time users have been asking for a means to find more content that they might like, stuff similar to the kind of things they already download,â€? Paul Gardner from Vuze tells TorrentFreak.â€œExisting sites tend not to offer anything beyond simple categorization (e.g. by format or genre), and only cover their own domain of content â€“ users are looking for something that works â€˜horizontallyâ€™, across sites, while at the same time zooming in on things that may be of interest.â€?Striving towards solving this problem the Vuze team came up with Swarm Discoveries, a behavior-based torrent content discovery system. So what makes it tick?â€œGiven the lack of any standardized metadata for torrents, and the huge diversity of naming conventions, languages etc., any approach based on matching between static torrent data is difficult. So what we decided to concentrate on was the behavioral aspects of torrent selection,â€? Gardner reveals.â€œUsers are already way smarter than us at finding content they like, so why not use their expertise to raise everybodyâ€™s game?â€?And this is where it gets both slightly more complex and much more interesting.â€œSwarm Discoveries is based on the fact that if Alice downloads torrents A, B and C then, in some (unspecified) way there is a link between A, B and C. At the most abstract the link is that Alice likes A, B and C,â€? Gardner explains.â€œNow if Bob downloads B, C and D this re-enforces the fact that B and C are somehow related, but between them we know nothing regarding A and D.â€?Of course, when looking at the habits of just Alice and Bob the dataset is very small. However, millions of people are using the Distributed Hash Table which results in a much larger sample and the creation of ever more interesting links between content.As a side note, Vuze (or Azureus as it was then) debuted the first ever BitTorrent DHT.TorrentFreak gave the feature a test drive, and this is what happened when we tested it on a Fuduntu Linux distro we planned to test in a VirtualBox virtual machine.1. First we loaded up the Fuduntu torrent using Vuzeâ€™s inbuilt torrent search feature. Once underway a right-click revealed the Swarm Discovery option.2. Once selected this short list of related content appeared.Item 1 is for a Knoppix torrent. Knoppix is another Linux distro so the connection to our Fuduntu download is obvious.Item 2 turns out to be Hirenâ€™s Boot CD, a collection of fairly geeky system management tools which is (coincidentally or not) based on Knoppix.3. At this point the discovery can continue simply by right clicking on any result and selecting â€œDiscover Relatedâ€?. If you want to do some research on the torrents already found, the same menu gives access to some research tools.4. Digging down another level produced further related results.Of course, the system doesnâ€™t work only for Linux distros. In our tests popular video and music content hashes produced the richest and most complex results.I donâ€™t want to do anything, just make it work!For those of you too busy (or lazy) to right-click on downloads to find explicit results you can sit back and let Vuze do the work for you. Over time Vuze builds up results in the main Swarm Discoveries tab (youâ€™ll find it under â€˜Plugins & Extrasâ€™) and ranks them â€“ the more ways a torrent is related to your downloads the higher the rank it will be assigned (up to a max of 100).If youâ€™re bored with the current results then right-click on sidebar entry and select â€˜delete all resultsâ€™, Vuze will start generating a new set to inspire you.Although the Swarm Discoveries system might at first appear to be a privacy nightmare, concerned users can rest easy. There are no external databases and relationship data is anonymous. (Not to be confused with anonymous downloads of course, that would require a VPN or similar)â€œSwarm Discoveries is entirely implemented using the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and results are automatically generated by Vuze clients â€“ there are no centralized components,â€? Gardner explains.â€œIn the same way that the DHT is used to relate content to peers during decentralized tracking it is also used to related one piece of content to another â€“ this relationship is stored anonymously, so when a Vuze client reads a relationship the originator of the relationship is unknown.â€?While Swarm Discoveries often produced fairly predictable results, such as supplying torrents to similar genres of music and movies, it also throws in the occasional curve ball â€“ perfect for those who browse YouTube for pop videos and end up two hours later viewing the mating rituals of a rare breed of mountain goat.Download the latest version of Vuze with Swarm Discoveries here.

SUDBURY, Ontario (Reuters) - In an office trailer parked outside a mine shaft in northern Ontario, operator Carolyn St-Jean leans back in her chair and monitors a machine loading nickel-rich ore into rail cars deep underground.Once filled, the automated train will snake through a series of narrow tunnels, emerge from a rocky outcropping, then loop past St-Jean's window and dump its payload for sorting.Vale SA, the Brazilian company that owns the mine near this nickel-rich Canadian town, has spent nearly $50 million in two years to install and test the "rail-veyor." The company believes the transport system will revolutionize how it builds and extracts new mineral deposits.The equipment is made locally by Rail-Veyor Technologies Global Inc. It is one of many mining technologies that developers hope will allow future production to be run almost entirely by people safely above ground.Such advances may prove crucial as easy-to-exploit deposits run dry and miners drill deeper in more remote places to supply China, India and other emerging economies. The technology could make mining cheaper and safer, avoiding the need to dig wide tunnels and hire large numbers of expensive, skilled workers."As we go deeper, if we continue to apply existing thinking and existing technologies, it's a death spiral" for company profits, said Alex Henderson, who heads Vale's technology team in Sudbury."We need to begin to look at a step-change in mining rather than just incrementally improving our existing processes."The rail-veyor is one such step-change. At the test site, it has halved the time to build a mine, and Vale expects a 150 percent boost in production rates before year end. Â  Continued...

Quantum entanglement stands as one of the strangest and hardest concepts to understand in physics. Two or more particles can interact in a specific ways that leave them entangled, such that a later measurement on one system identifies what the outcome of a similar measurement on the second systemâ€”no matter how far they are separated in space.Repeated experiments have verified that this works even when the measurements are performed more quickly than light could travel between the sites of measurement: there's no slower-than-light influence that can pass between the entangled particles. However, one possible explanation for entanglement would allow for a faster-than-light exchange from one particle to the other. Odd as it might seem, this still doesn't violate relativity, since the only thing exchanged is the internal quantum stateâ€”no external information is passed.But a new analysis by J-D. Bancal, S. Pironio, A. AcÃ­n, Y-C. Liang, V. Scarani, and N. Gisin shows that any such explanation would inevitably open the door to faster-than-light communication. In other words, quantum entanglement cannot involve the passage of informationâ€”even hidden, internal information, inaccessible to experimentâ€”at any velocity, without also allowing for other types of interactions that violate relativity.Experiments have definitively demonstrated entanglement, and ruled out any kind of slower-than-light communication between two separated objects.Â The standard explanation for this behavior involves what's called nonlocality: the idea that the two objects are actually still a single quantum system, even though they may be far apart. That idea is uncomfortable to many people (including most famously Albert Einstein), but it preserves the principle of relativity, which states in part that no information can travel faster than light.To get around nonlocality, several ideas have been proposed over the decades. Many of these fall into the category of hidden variables, wherein quantum systems have physical properties (beyond the standard quantities like position, momentum, and spin) that are not directly accessible to experiment. In entangled systems, the hidden variables could be responsible for transferring state information from one particle to the other, producing measurements that appear coordinated. Since these hidden variables are not accessible to experimenters, they can't be used for communication. Relativity is preserved.Hidden variable theories involving slower-than-light transfer of state information are already ruled out by the experiments that exclude more ordinary communication. Some modern variations combine hidden variables with full nonlocality, allowing for instantaneous transfer of internal state information. But could non-instantaneous, faster-than-light hidden variables theories still work?To investigate this possibility, the authors of the new study considered the possible experimental consequences. Obviously, one way to test it would be to increase the separation between the parts of the entangled system to see if we can detect a delay in apparently instantaneous correlation we currently observe. Sufficiently fast rates of transfer, however, would still be indistinguishable from nonlocality, given that real lab measurements take finite time to perform (this assumes that both experiments happen on Earth).The researchers took a theoretical approach instead, using something known as the no-signalling conditions. They considered an entangled system with a set of independent physical attributes, some observable, some hidden variables. Next, they allowed the state of the hidden variables to propagate faster than the speed of light, which let them influence the measurements on the separated pieces of the experiment.However, because of the nature of quantum mechanical systems, there was a symmetry between the hidden and measurable attributes of the systemâ€”meaning if the hidden variables could transfer information faster than light, then the properties we can measure would do so as well. This is a violation of the no-signalling condition, and causes serious problems for the ordinary interpretations of quantum physics.Of course, one conceivable conclusion would be that faster-than-light communication is possible; this result provided a possible avenue for testing that possibility. By restricting the bounds on the speed of interaction between entangled systems, future experiments could show whether any actual information is traveling or not.However, the far more likely option is that relativity is correct. In that case, the strong ban on faster-than-light communication would rule out the possibility of faster-than-light transfer of information encoded in hidden variables, and force us to deal with nonlocality. Once again, it would seem that local realism and relativity are incompatible notions in the quantum world.

Hurricane Sandy swelled into a major threat to much of the U.S. East Coast on Thursday, U.S. forecasters said, as the storm swirled through the Bahamas after killing 21 people across the Caribbean.HAVANA (Reuters) - Hurricane Sandy swelled into a major threat to much of the U.S. East Coast on Thursday, U.S. forecasters said, as the storm swirled through the Bahamas after killing 21 people across the Caribbean.Strengthening rapidly after tearing into Jamaica and crossing the warm Caribbean Sea, Sandy hit southeastern Cuba early on Thursday with top sustained winds up to 110 miles per hour (177 km per hour) that left a trail of destruction, especially in the historic city of Santiago de Cuba.The Cuban government said on Thursday night that 11 people died in the storm, most killed by falling trees or in building collapses, including nine in Santiago de Cuba province and two in neighboring Guantanamo province.Haiti's civil protection office said nine people had died despite not getting a direct hit from Sandy, and one person was killed by falling rocks in Jamaica when the storm struck there on Wednesday.The Cuban deaths were an unusually high number for the communist island that prides itself on protecting its people from storms by ordering mass evacuations.Images on Cuban television showed downed trees, damaged buildings and debris-clogged streets in the country's second-largest city of Santiago de Cuba, which suffered a direct hit when the storm came ashore in the early morning hours."Everything's destroyed in Santiago. People are going to have to work very hard to recover," Alexis Manduley, a resident of the 498-year-old city, told Reuters by telephone.Santiago de Cuba, with a population of about 500,000, is 470 miles southeast of Havana.U.S. government forecasters warned that much of the U.S. East Coast could get swiped by Sandy, with flooding, heavy rains and high winds beginning late Thursday in Florida. By early next week - amid final preparations for the crucial November 6 presidential election - the storm could hit an area of New England where Hurricane Irene caused severe damage last year.White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to speculate about whether there would be any change in President Barack Obama's campaign travel schedule because of Sandy, as he makes a last-minute blitz to win an edge over Republican Mitt Romney in a close race."The president's concern about this storm is to make sure that citizens in potentially affected areas are aware of this and taking necessary precaution," Carney said.He spoke aboard Air Force One as Obama headed from Florida to Virginia, saying the president had asked his team to hold regular briefings with federal disaster officials as the storm progresses.Sandy is forecast to make landfall as a Category 1 hurricane and the hardest-hit areas could span anywhere from the coastal Carolinas up to Maine, with New York City and the Boston area potentially in harm's way."Regardless of the exact track of Sandy, it is likely that significant impacts will be felt over portions of the U.S. East Coast through the weekend and into early next week," the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said."It's going to be a high-impact event," said Bob Oravec, a lead forecaster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's HydroMeteorological Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland."It has the potential to be a very significant storm with respect to coastal flooding, depending on exactly where it comes in. Power outages are definitely a big threat," he said.In a subsequent report, NOAA's storm-prediction center suggested that Sandy could invite the ghoulish nickname "Frankenstorm," due to upcoming celebrations of Halloween and some of the freakish characteristics of the storm.The late-season cyclone is widely expected to undergo an unusual merger with a polar air mass over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Tuesday, essentially bringing two sources of energy together and giving Sandy the potential to punch above its weight as it sloshes across the U.S. coast.At 11 p.m. EDT), the NHC said Sandy was about 15 miles north-northeast of Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas and packing maximum sustained winds of 90 mph.High winds, rains and pounding surf are expected across parts of Florida's Atlantic coast, with the biggest impact lasting through Friday.Orange juice prices rose in U.S. trading on Thursday on speculative buying as investors bet that Sandy could damage crops in the citrus-rich Sunshine State.Unlike Irene, which caused billions of dollars in damage as it battered the Northeast in August last year, Sandy is forecast to be a weaker storm but will be moving slower than Irene, likely bringing more rain and increasing its potential for damage, weather forecasters said.At $4.3 billion in losses, Irene ranks as one of the 10 costliest hurricanes, adjusted for inflation and excluding federally insured damage, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group.Jeff Masters, a hurricane specialist and blogger with private forecaster Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com), said a landfall by Sandy on Monday along the Mid-Atlantic Coast could trigger "a billion-dollar disaster.""In this scenario, Sandy would be able to bring sustained winds near hurricane force over a wide stretch of heavily populated coast," he said.Alternately, Masters said, some computer forecast models indicated Sandy had the potential to unleash "the heaviest October rains ever reported in the northeast U.S., Nova Scotia and New Brunswick."NOAA's Oravec said there could be tropical-storm to hurricane-force winds on the coast and added: "Coastal flooding will be a big concern."Sandy is expected to hit the United States during a full moon, increasing the flood potential since tides will be at or near their highest."There's a big potential for huge effects from the storm," said Oravec."We can't rule out the potential for snow eventually as we go into the week and the storm moves inland," he said.(Reporting by Jeff Franks and Nelson Acosta in Havana, Neil Hartnell in the Bahamas, Kevin Gray in Miami, Ben Berkowitz and Josephine Mason in New York; Writing by Tom Brown; Editing by David Brunnstrom, Philip Barbara and Lisa Shumaker)

In the event that a giant asteroid is headed toward Earth, youâ€™d better hope that itâ€™s blindingly white. A pale asteroid would reflect sunlight â€” and over time, this bouncing of photons off its surface could create enough of a force to push the asteroid off its course. How might one encourage such a deflection? The answer, according to an MIT graduate student: with a volley or two of space-launched paintballs. Sung Wook Paek, a graduate student in MITâ€™s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, says if timed just right, pellets full of paint powder, launched in two rounds from a spacecraft at relatively close distance, would cover the front and back of an asteroid, more than doubling its reflectivity, or albedo. The initial force from the pellets would bump an asteroid off course; over time, the sunâ€™s photons would deflect the asteroid even more. Paekâ€™s paper detailing this unconventional strategy won the 2012 Move an Asteroid Technical Paper Competition , sponsored by the United Nationsâ€™ Space Generation Advisory Council, which solicits creative solutions to space-related problems from students and young professionals. Paek presented his paper this month at the International Astronautical Congress in Naples, Italy. The challenge put forth by this yearâ€™s U.N. competition was to identify novel solutions for safely deflecting a near-Earth object , such as an asteroid. Scientists have proposed a wide variety of methods to avoid an asteroid collision. Some proposals launch a projectile or spacecraft to collide with an incoming asteroid; the European Space Agency is currently investigating such a mission. Other methods have included detonating a nuclear bomb near an asteroid or equipping spacecraft as â€œgravity tractors,â€? using a craftâ€™s gravitational field to pull an asteroid off its path. Paekâ€™s paintball strategy builds on a solution submitted by last yearâ€™s competition winner, who proposed deflecting an asteroid with a cloud of solid pellets. Paek came up with a similar proposal, adding paint to the pellets to take advantage of solar radiation pressure â€” the force exerted on objects by the sunâ€™s photons. Researchers have observed that pressure from sunlight can alter the orbits of geosynchronous satellites, while others have proposed equipping spacecraft with sails to catch solar radiation, much like a sailboat catches wind. In his proposal, Paek used the asteroid Apophis as a theoretical test case. According to astronomical observations, this 27-gigaton rock may come close to Earth in 2029, and then again in 2036. Paek determined that five tons of paint would be required to cover the massive asteroid, which has a diameter of 1,480 feet. He used the asteroidâ€™s period of rotation to determine the timing of pellets, launching a first round to cover the front of the asteroid, and firing a second round once the asteroidâ€™s backside is exposed. As the pellets hit the asteroidâ€™s surface, they would burst apart, splattering the space rock with a fine, five-micrometer-layer of paint. From his calculations, Paek estimates that it would take up to 20 years for the cumulative effect of solar radiation pressure to successfully pull the asteroid off its Earthbound trajectory. He says launching pellets with traditional rockets may not be an ideal option, as the violent takeoff may rupture the payload. Instead, he envisions paintballs may be made in space, in ports such as the International Space Station, where a spacecraft could then pick up a couple of rounds of pellets to deliver to the asteroid. Paek adds that paint isnâ€™t the only substance that such pellets might hold. For instance, the capsules could be filled with aerosols that, when fired at an asteroid, â€œimpart air drag on the incoming asteroid to slow it down,â€? Paek says. â€œOr you could just paint the asteroid so you can track it more easily with telescopes on Earth. So there are other uses for this method.â€? Lindley Johnson, program manager for NASAâ€™s Near Earth Objects Observation Program, says Paekâ€™s proposal is â€œan innovative variationâ€? on a method used by others to capitalize on solar radiation pressure. For example, MESSENGER, a spacecraft orbiting Mercury, is equipped with solar sails that propel the craft with solar radiation pressure, reducing the fuel needed to power it. â€œIt is very important that we develop and test a few deflection techniques sufficiently so that we know we have a viable â€˜toolboxâ€™ of deflection capabilities to implement when we inevitably discover an asteroid on an impact trajectory,â€? Johnson says.William Ailor, principal engineer for Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., adds that the potential for an asteroid collision is a long-term challenge for scientists and engineers. â€œThese types of analyses are really timely because this is a problem weâ€™ll have basically forever,â€? Ailor says. â€œItâ€™s nice that weâ€™re getting young people thinking about it in detail, and I really applaud that.â€?

127 of my files in Dropbox are now gone forever, due to a bug where files were "updated" to be 0 bytes, and Dropbox lost its previous copy of the file.2 other files (precious family photos) were also affected, but it happened recently enough to be recovered manually by Dropbox engineers. 23 other files were also turned to 0 byte dust, but Dropbox kept its version history of these and I could revert them to their original version.Check whether you've been affected (on Mac or Linux) by running this command in a Terminal, it'll spit out a list of 0-byte files to a text file on your desktop.Important: Make sure you sanity check the list. Some systems have hidden 0-byte files, such as Macs' "Icon\r", that are expected and normal.If you find any that look unexpected, let Dropbox know, and reference this blog post to them so they can connect it with the issue I reported.I've included my correspondence with Dropbox on the issue below. They've been very nice about it, and are looking into it, but this is a very serious bug. Because they don't know what the bug is, potentially anyone could be affected. I'll update this post if they find a fix.Update: Some folks on Hacker News, and Matt Holden of Dropbox in the comments, have raised the possibility of filesystem corruption, particularly because of a recently reported ext4 bug. I do use ext4, so this can plausibly explain why my files were 0-byte'd in the first place, and why others have reported finding 0-byte'd files.I also do not use Packrat, a premium Dropbox feature that stores version history for longer than 30 days, so this could plausibly explain why my 127 files that had been 0-byte'd months ago no longer have a version history of before then. I wasn't aware of the 30-day window.However, these do not plausibly explain why the 2 manually recovered files that had recently been 0-byte'd, well within the 30-day window, showed no pre-0-byte version history, and required the assistance of Dropbox engineers.It could be that the bug here has nothing to do with their desktop client - it could be a version history bug in the web frontend that affects some recently edited files. If that's the case, then that still needs to be fixed, so that people in my position can recover files their disk corrupted before they pass out of the 30-day window. It's only by finding and fixing that website bug that Dropbox can say with confidence that there's no desktop client bug.Update 2: A report by someone who is on OS X, uses Packrat, but has lost 70 files they can't recover.

Flooding and power outages caused by Hurricane Sandy have forced several New York data centers to switch to generator power. But those generators are quickly running out of fuel, so data center companies are telling their customers to shut down their servers and move workloads elsewhere.One of the worst situations is at 75 Broad Street in Manhattan, where both Internap and Peer1 Hosting are shutting down operations "after basement-level flooding disabled critical diesel fuel pumps," Data Center Knowledge reports. 75 Broad Street is part of the "Zone A" portion of the city that is under emergency evacuation orders, as is another data center operated by Datagram at 33 Whitehall Street. The Datagram outage led to downtime for popular websites Gawker, Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed.Peer1's official network status page reported last night that it was running on emergency generator power. This morning, the company said "we have an estimate of 4 hours for the fuel left on our generators. Our techs and facility are continuously working to get emergency fuel delivery on time and was looking to set-up a temporary tank and pump since the basement is still flooded. In the event of not receiving the fuel on time, worst case scenario is we will have to gracefully shutdown the facility."The worst case scenario has apparently occurred, as the latest update says, "We are going to implement a controlled shutdown of NY Data Center at 10:45 ET." (UPDATE: Peer1 reported good news just before 12:30pm ET. "The New York facility is still on generator power, sustaining longer than initially estimated," Peer1 said. "We will have the latest update on the remaining fuel available, along with the arrival of fuel replacement shortly.")Internap is reporting much the same scenario. In a note to customers made public on Pastebin, Internap said, "The flooding has submerged and destroyed the site's diesel pumps and is preventing fuel from being pumped to the generators on the mezzanine level. The available fuel reserves on the mezzanine level are estimated to support customer loads for approximately 5-7 hours. Once this fuel supply has been exhausted the generator will no longer be able to sustain operation and critical customer power loads will be lost. The building itself is being evacuated and no remote hands support will be available to assist in any equipment shutdown."Internap advised its self-service customers to shut down their servers immediately and is having its customer support team execute a "graceful" shutdown of servers for managed customers. Internap's cloud services are also being shut down, the company said. We've asked Internap for an update and will report back if we get one. But according to iT News, Internap sent customers a follow-up e-mail this morning that said, "Available fuel reserves on the mezzanine level are estimated to be nearly depleted and able to support customer loads for less than 2 hours. Once this fuel supply has been exhausted the generator will no longer be able to sustain operation and critical customer power loads will be lost."UPDATE: Internap is reportedlyÂ out of fuel and offline, but it is trying to get more fuel to the building. As of 12:55pm ET, the Internap network operations center hotline was playing a recorded message that says the facility is "currently without power due to flooding" and that co-location and IP customers can expect "widespread outages." Later in the day, the company posted a blogÂ saying the 75 Broad Street facility was still without power, but that Internap isÂ trying to get its generator farm back up and running. "It is unclear how long it will take ConEd to restore utility power to the site, but we are preparing for the possibility of remaining on generator power for many days," Internap said.Â In addition to running out of fuel in secondary tanks, Internap said the flooding damaged "both our redundant fuel pumps and our generator fuel tank." Internap is coordinating fuel deliveries and pumps, and said it will have engineers "fabricate pipe to bring the fuel directly to the generators on the mezzanine level."In addition to damage caused by flooding, New York power company Con Edison said it preemptively shut off electricity in part of Lower Manhattan last night, and reported today that substation damage and downed wires cut off power to many customers. Con Edison called it "the largest storm-related outage in our history."As mentioned, Gawker, Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed have suffered downtime as a result of flooding at Datagram's data center at 33 Whitehall Street. As of this writing, the main Gawker sites are still offline (stripped-down versions are reachable at live.gawker.com), while the Huffington Post andÂ Buzzfeed have gotten themselves back online.Further outages includedÂ Steadfast hosting at 121 Varick Street in New York City due to "an auxiliary electrical failure," and Init7 at 111 8th Avenue, due to a data center power outage. Init7 operates IP backbone services. As a result of the outage, the company said to expect "possible routing issues from/to the United States." As it turns out, Internap also has servers at the 8th Avenue address, but they are operating under generator power and have enough fuel for several days.It's not as if data centers didn't take any precautions. In advance of the storm, Data Center Knowledge reported that "data center providers in New York, Philadelphia and the Washington, DC area said they are testing and fueling up their emergency backup generators, preparing to maintain services during any utility power outages caused by the hurricane." The cloud storage provider Nirvanix allowed customers to move data out of its data center in New Jersey for free. And cloud service providers such as Amazon are closely monitoring data centers on the East Coast, stocking up on generator fuel, and having extra staff on hand.As various non-storm-related outages at Amazon have shown, customers relying on hosting providers and cloud services may want to build systems that can fail over across multiple regions. Ultimately, when a data center is in the wrong spot at the wrong time, even the most extensive preparations may not be enough to stay online in the face of a storm like Hurricane Sandy.

The Internet has evolved quite a bit since I first logged on to CompuServe in 1994. Iâ€™d spent a few years tooling around on BBS (Bulletin Board Systems) connections throughout the country at that point and the most visible portions of a forming World Wide Web were quite innocent in appearance. But as I ramped up my fatherâ€™s 4600 baud modem and looked around at the fringes of online existence, I unknowingly caught a glimpse at the Webâ€™s early underbelly. From there, pornography, craziness and illegal activities were easily accessible. There werenâ€™t many people logging on so, naturally, there werenâ€™t many people to police this new digital space. Eventually, as AOL, Prodigy and other ISPs became more mainstream, the more nefarious outlets vanished into the shadows. But where did it all go? I recently took a plunge into the â€˜Deep Web,â€™ a sub-surface area of the Internet not indexed by search engines and only available to those on the forefront of technology, namely people connected to the Tor Network. This network of hidden websites is the new underbelly of the Web, the New Underground, if you will, chock full of all sorts of illicit activities. Child porn peddlers, drug dealers, hitmen and other criminal groups thrive on the Deep Web and anonymity reigns supreme. The following post outlines my findings and hopefully sheds some light on the true Wild Wild West of the World Wide Web.What is the Deep Web?: Wikipedia has an excellent overview on the Deep Web.The Deep Web (also called Deepnet, the invisible Web, DarkNet, Undernet or the hidden Web) refers to World Wide Web content that is not part of the Surface Web, which is indexed by standard search engines. Mike Bergman, credited with coining the phrase,[1] has said that searching on the Internet today can be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed. Most of the Webâ€™s information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, and standard search engines do not find it. Traditional search engines cannot â€œseeâ€? or retrieve content in the deep Web â€“ those pages do not exist until they are created dynamically as the result of a specific search. The deep Web is several orders of magnitude larger than the surface Web.So if the Internet as you know it is an iceberg, the smallest part of that iceberg, the visible portion, is where you have been surfing your entire life. You visit websites, click links, use search engines to research topics of interest and generally just make your way around the visible Web. But below that visible portion, there is a much larger compilation of destinations beyond the reach of most Internet users. This portion, the Deep Web, is much harder for the average person to access and even harder to navigate. Much of the criminal activity that happens on the Deep Web is cloaked in anonymity, shrouded in secrecy or somehow hidden from the prying eyes that would love to put an end to this virtual land of OZ. Essentially what Iâ€™m saying is this: You may be familiar with the Internet, maybe even the darker side of the Internet. You may know how to find pornography for free, download music illegally, use a torrent program to download pirated movies and other media or purchase prescription pills from some online pharmacy. But if you havenâ€™t visited the Deep Web, you ainâ€™t seen nothing yet. Sure, there are research papers and legitimate and interesting pieces of content to view on The Other Side but thereâ€™s also some pretty nefarious happenings there.How do you connect to the Deep Web?: Though the Deep Web may be beyond those of you with little in the way of technical and Web savvy, itâ€™s not impossible, nor even extremely difficult to visit. First, youâ€™ll need to download Tor, the software that allows you to access the Deep Web. Tor is designed to provide Internet users with as close to complete anonymity as possible. The Tor website describes their software and their mission as follows.You can use Tor on virtually any PC, Mac or even mobile devices like the iPhone and Android-operated smartphones. But, if, like me, youâ€™re using Firefox, you next need to install the Torbutton. With the Tor software up and running and the Torbutton installed, youâ€™ll see a small onion logo near the address bar of your browser. If youâ€™re correctly logged in to the Tor network, you can click this button and begin to explore the Deep Web. This collection of Deep Web links should get you started. But, keep in mind, you wonâ€™t be able to maneuver in this new land quite as easily as you did back on the visible Web. There is no Google-like search engine of these sites that Iâ€™m aware of at the moment. Instead, itâ€™s a collection of Wikis and BBS-like sites that aggregate links to other locations on the Deep Web. These sites generally have bizarre, unmemorable domain names like SdddEEDOHIIDdddgmomionw.onion. Thatâ€™s right, instead of .com, these domains generally end in the .onion suffix. And because youâ€™ll never remember how you got to where you are if you spend any significant time here, itâ€™s best to save URLs or bookmark your way through this journey.What can you find on the Deep Web?: The Silk Road is the most popular place to buy drugs on the Deep Web. From ecstasy, pure MDMA, marijuana, psychedelics and seeds to opiates, they have basically any drug with a userbase. They also have categories for â€˜servicesâ€™ like hacking, â€˜lab suppliesâ€™ like sulfuric acid and liquid mercury, â€˜moneyâ€™ for stolen credit cards, travelers checks and forged bills and coins, â€˜jewelryâ€™ like uncut stones, stolen gold and other precious metals obtained via devious means and finally â€˜weaponsâ€™ where they currently list a Glock 17 for sale out of Canada that â€œincludes 1 clip with 9 live rounds.â€? Another Deep Web drug outlet, the General Store, focuses on Ketamine, MDMA, MDPV and DMT (you may need to Google some of those).Additional items in the â€˜marijuanaâ€™ category on The Silk Road:Forum posts like this are common (and often answered) and even include requests for murders:(Note: This is not from The Silk Road, but a popular message board on the Deep Web)Most transactions on the Deep Web are conducted via Bitcoins. You can purchase virtually anything with this digital currency, ranging from the legit to the oh-so-far-away from legit. You can buy all the items outlined above and you can even hire a prostitute. There is, however, some debate over whether or not these transactions are anonymous (more on that below). 1 Bitcoin = $9 US.You can find literally ANYTHING illegal on the Deep Web. Speaking of illegalâ€¦Let me issue a STRONG WARNING at this point. Be extremely careful what sites you visit and links you click. You could find yourself on a child pornography website or just all-around grotesque sexual deviance-focused site that will ruin your experience (and in the case of child pornography, your life). The wiki page linked to above contains mostly safe sites to search but stay away from anything labeled as a â€˜chanâ€™ or â€˜bulletin boardâ€™ as they probably traffic heavily in child pornography. Anything labeled CP is to be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS. It will lead you to child porn.There are sites on the Deep Web that offer the services of hitmen, advice to gang members, directions on how to build explosives, how to cheat at virtually anything and pretty much any other illegal activity or service that you can dream of â€“ itâ€™s all there, some of it is frightening, some of it is interesting, all of it is anonymous. Wait, is it really anonymous?Is this all truly anonymous?: Probably not. To the horseâ€™s mouth, we go.Though he may be saying that because Bitcoin hopes to be viewed as a legitimate business.My journey though The New Underground, the Deep Dark Web, was interesting, to say the least. Thereâ€™s a lot of potential for trouble down near the bottom of this iceberg, so always be aware of what youâ€™re doing and the legality of your actions. Still, I have an unquenchable thirst for the unknown so by carefully maneuvering in a way that kept several meters and a snake pit between myself and the most vile content on the Deep Web, I was able to learn a bit about a facet of the Internet I had yet to discover. Iâ€™d encourage you to poke around a bit as well. But, remember, do so at your own risk. Be safe, watch what you click and refrain from purchasing anything along the way.Be careful, itâ€™s a whole new world down there.

Last year AMD officially became an ARM licensee, although the deal wasn't publicized at the time. Fast forward to June 2012 and we saw the first fruits of that deal: AMD announced it would integrate ARM's Cortex A5 core into its 2013 APUs to enable TrustZone support.Today comes a much bigger announcement: AMD will be building Opteron processors based on a 64-bit ARM architecture. There are no product announcements today, but the 64-bit ARM Opterons will go into production in 2014. Today's announcement is about a processor license, not an ARM architecture license - in other words, AMD will integrate an ARM designed 64-bit core for this new Opteron. Update: AMD will integrate ARM's new Cortex-A50 series of 64-bit ARMv8 CPU cores.The only other detail we know is that these ARM based Opterons will embed SeaMicro's Freedom Fabric, presumably on-die.AMD offering ARM based Opterons is really to target the microserver market. As for why AMD isn't using Jaguar for these parts, it's likely that by going with ARM it can lower the development time and cost to get into this market. The danger here is the total microserver market is expected to be around 10% of the overall server market, but that includes x86 + ARM. With x86 as the default incumbent, it's going to be an uphill battle for AMD/ARM to carve out a significant portion of that market.AMD was quick to mention that despite today's announcement, it will continue to build x86 CPUs and APUs for client and server markets.Overall the move sounds a lot like AMD trying to move quickly to capitalize on a new market. It's unclear just how big the ARM based server market will be, but AMD seems to hope that it'll be on the forefront of that revolution - should it happen. Embracing ARM also further aligns AMD with one of Intel's most threatening sources of competition at this point. The question is whether or not AMD is doing itself more harm than good by working to devalue x86 in the server space. I suspect it'll be years before we know the real impact of AMD's move here.The other major takeaway is that AMD is looking to find lower cost ways of bringing competitive platforms to market. I do think that a Jaguar based Opteron would likely be the best route for AMD, but it would also likely require a bit more effort than integrating an ARM core.Obviously competition will be more prevalent in the ARM server space, but here is where AMD hopes its brand and position in the market will be able to give it an advantage. AMD will also be relying heavily on the SeaMicro Freedom Fabric for giving its ARM based Opterons a leg up on the competition. This is one time where I really wish AMD hadn't spun off its fabs.

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday in one of the most important copyright cases in a decade, over whether works manufactured outside the United States can be resold here without the permission of the copyright owner.The decision could have a huge impact on the $63 billion "gray market" for goods purchased abroad and sold for a higher price in the United States.Both parties to the case believe a loss for their side will result in a doomsday scenario of sorts. One side says that a ruling in their favor is the only way to free American consumers from the potential of copyright holders to exert never ending control over their material. The other side insists that a decision for them is the only way U.S. companies will be able to successfully participate in the global marketplace. A down-the-line victory for one side or the other is likely to result in the loser lobbying Congress for an update to the Copyright Act.At issue in the case, Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, are provisions of the Copyright Act that appear contradictory. One section says that the importation into the United States, without the authority of the copyright owner, of works acquired abroad is an infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute copies. However, another part of the act limits the copyright holder's distribution rights by saying that the owner of a copy "lawfully made under this title" can sell or otherwise get rid of it. That resell right is known as the "first-sale doctrine."Supap Kirtsaeng, a Thai man who attended college and graduate school in the United States, had his family at home buy textbooks manufactured internationally and ship them to him. He then resold the books on eBay. John Wiley & Sons, a prominent textbook publisher, has the exclusive rights to distribute its textbooks in the United States, and some of the books Kirtsaeng sold were Wiley textbooks that were manufactured abroad. Wiley sued and was awarded several hundred thousand dollars in damages. The student, who maintained that he had the right to resell books he owned, appealed. In August 2011, the 2nd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Wiley and held that the first-sale doctrine was inapplicable because the "lawfully made under this title" language referred only to copies manufactured in the United States.In its decision, authored by Judge Jose Cabranes, the 2nd Circuit acknowledged the "particularly difficult question of statutory construction" and said that "if our decision leads to policy consequences ... which Congress now find unpalatable, Congress is of course able to correct our judgment."Those "unpalatable" consequences have been highlighted, in amicus briefs and other public statements by companies like eBay and Costco, whose businesses rely on resales, as well as by libraries and museums who acquire works from around the world.(We wrote about the library group's amicus brief in July.)Kirtsaeng's brief, submitted by a team including Joshua Rosenkranz of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, also walks through examples of what could happen if the court upholds the 2nd Circuit's decision. The resale or lease of cars imported into the United States, which almost always have copyrighted software, would violate copyright laws, and movie producers could begin manufacturing DVDs abroad and "enjoy a permanent veto over any further rental of the foreign-made DVD," the brief said.Though "anyone who makes a product would love to control what happens to it downstream," the longstanding U.S. law is that if you bought it, you own it, no matter where that purchase was made, Rosenkranz said. That is a point he will put "front and center" to the court, he said.While it sounds like an odd outcome that goods manufactured abroad could receive more far-reaching copyright protection than goods manufactured domestically, John Wiley's team, led by Theodore Olson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, argued in its brief that those fears were much ado about nothing. Kirtsaeng's examples, it argued, focus on scenarios where the copyright owner authorized the original import. The court does not need to address what happens to the first-sale doctrine in the event of an "authorized" importation, the Wiley brief said, and can instead just focus on Kirtsaeng's unauthorized import and sale.Evan Finkel, an intellectual property partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, said because of the facts of the case and the section's wording, it's unlikely the Supreme Court will enact such a specific exception in this case. Instead, should the court rule for Wiley, he said, they could note some exception for individual consumers reselling a book or two, or at least note that it is a question for another day.Monday will be like the second time around for this copyright question. In 2010, the Supreme Court upheld a 9th Circuit decision involving Costco's sale of gray-market Omega brand watches. The circuit court had ruled that the first sale doctrine does not apply to works manufactured outside the United States. The Supreme Court's holding came with no opinion, however. It was a result of a 4-4 tie, with Justice Elena Kagan not participating. This time around, Kagan will be on the bench.While both parties argue that history and statutory interpretation are on their side, they recognize to some extent that an increasingly shrinking world might not fit within the confines of the current law. Wiley's brief acknowledges that many of the scenarios, like one involving Netflix and DVD rentals, could not have been considered by Congress because they didn't exist when the first sale-related section was drafted nearly 40 years ago.Follow us on TwitterÂ @AlisonFrankel,Â @erin_gs,Â @ReutersLegalÂ Â |Â Like us onÂ FacebookÂ Â Â

Computerworld - The FBI has arrested Paul Ceglia for attempting to defraud Facebook and its co-founder Mark Zuckerberg in a scheme to grab a large stake in the company and billions of dollars.Federal agents picked up 39-year-old Ceglia at his home in Wellsville, N.Y. this morning, according to a report in Forbes.Ceglia first filed a lawsuit in June 2010, claiming he signed a contract with Zuckerberg that entitles him to 84% ownership of what is easily the world's largest social network. In an amended filing last year, though, Ceglia modified his claim, alleging he was owed 50% of Zuckerberg's stake in the social networking company.According to a criminal complaint filed with the Southern District of New York, Ceglia is accused of using the U.S. Postal Service as part of a fraudulent scam against Facebook and Zuckerberg.Ceglia is being charged with mail fraud and wire fraud."Ceglia filed a federal lawsuit falsely claiming that he was entitled to at least a 50% interest in Facebook," the complaint contends. "Ceglia has deliberately engaged in a systematic effort to defraud Facebook and Zuckerberg and to corrupt the federal judicial process."Not surprisingly, today's arrest was met with excitement at Facebook."We commend the United States Attorney for charging Ceglia with federal crimes in connection with his fraudulent lawsuit against Facebook," Orin Snyder, a partner with Gibson Dunn, attorneys for Facebook and Zuckerberg, said in an email to Computerworld. "Ceglia used the federal court system to perpetuate his fraud and will now be held accountable for his criminal scheme."The complaint also contends that Ceglia and Zuckerberg had signed a contract between them, but it had nothing to do with Facebook, did not reference Facebook and did not give Ceglia any interest in the social network.And federal investigators allege that as part of his scheme, Ceglia manufactured and destroyed evidence, for instance replacing a page of the original contract with a fraudulent one that made it look like Zuckerberg had offered Ceglia interest in the company.The complaint even has a section titled: The Founding of Facebook Did Not Involve Ceglia.In 2011, Facebook attorneys filed court documents saying they had found evidence that Ceglia had concealed or destroyed relevant documents, including six missing USB drives.The social network's lawyers said they had uncovered an "authentic" contract that showed that Ceglia wasn't owed any interest in Facebook.Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld.

BASF has been researching into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and the processes that can be used to manufacture these highly efficient storage materials for gases on an industrial scale, for more than ten years. In September, BASF was awarded the Pierre Potier Prize in the field of process innovation for its successful research. This prize is awarded for outstanding examples of sustainable innovations in the field of chemistry by the two French chemical associations FÃ©dÃ©ration FranÃ§aise pour les sciences de la Chimie (FFC) and lâ€™Union des Industries Chimiques (UIC) in honour of the chemist and pharmacist Pierre Potier.We spoke with Dr. Manuela Gaab, one of the chemists in the MOF research team at BASF, in order to learn more about the potential of MOFs, their applications and the innovative new manufacturing process.Why is this new manufacturing process so innovative and sustainable? This novel process enables us to produce aluminium MOFs on an industrial scale for the first time. We can now produce batches of several tons, and they can be used commercially in applications such as storage tanks for natural gas. Another important advantage is that this innovative process no longer employs any organic solvents, only water. This makes it safe and environmentally friendly. These MOFs are very easy to produce, so easy that advanced school students can make them in our school laboratory.Why are MOFs so special? The special feature of MOFs is that their crystalline nanostructures enable them to be used to store natural gas and other fuel gases such as hydrogen. MOFs consist of a three-dimensional metal-organic framework with pore sizes in the nanometer range. Their high porosity and their large internal surface area allow them to be used to store large quantities of gas.The huge surface area of these crystals is illustrated very well by MOF-210, which was developed by Professor Yaghi (University of California, Berkeley). These zinc carboxylate crystals have a surface area of more than 10 000 m2 per gram. This corresponds to three football pitches within a material quantity that correlates to a sugar cube! Their enormous surface area enables metal-organic frameworks to be used to store large quantities of gas, just like water in a sponge.What are the applications for MOFs? Mobility is an interesting area of application for MOFs. At BASF, we are researching into alternative power concepts for the future that are environmentally friendly and conserve resources as well as being comfortable. We are investigating several different concepts aimed at improving the performance of vehicles powered by electricity and natural gas. MOFs can make a decisive contribution to the performance of vehicles powered by natural gas. Up until now, very few vehicles powered by natural gas have been approved for use on the roads, even though they represent an environmentally friendly alternative mode of transport. One of the main reasons for this is their low fuel storage capacity, which causes the bulky gas tanks and bottles to take up lots of room, and their limited range. They have to be fitted with an extra tank, and some of the luggage space is used to accommodate large gas bottles. MOFs can play an important role here, because their special properties can be used to obtain a large increase in fuel storage capacity.How can MOFs be used to increase the storage capacity of tanks for natural gas? Gas molecules can be stored at a higher density on the surfaces of MOFs than in conventional tanks. This enables more gas to be stored in tanks with the same volume at the same pressure. Larger quantities of gas in the tank increase the range of vehicles and, in future, cars powered by natural gas will be able to travel twice as far on one tank of gas.What other possible applications are there for MOFs? Separating and purifying gases are examples of industrial applications for MOFs. These applications make use of the different pore sizes of MOFs and differences in the affinity of gases for different materials. Another industrial application is catalysis, and we are also currently exploring other applications such as fuel cells for automobiles. MOFs could be used to store hydrogen fuel in the same way as the natural gas that is used to power vehicles. These are only a few examples of the versatile range of applications for MOFs and their future potential. We are in a position to supply customized MOFs in order to meet the specific demands of different customers, and new classes of MOF will also gradually find their way onto the market.

In the space of one hour, my entire digital life was destroyed. First my Google account was taken over, then deleted. Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages. And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.In many ways, this was all my fault. My accounts were daisy-chained together. Getting into Amazon let my hackers get into my Apple ID account, which helped them get into Gmail, which gave them access to Twitter. Had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, itâ€™s possible that none of this would have happened, because their ultimate goal was always to take over my Twitter account and wreak havoc. Lulz.Had I been regularly backing up the data on my MacBook, I wouldnâ€™t have had to worry about losing more than a yearâ€™s worth of photos, covering the entire lifespan of my daughter, or documents and e-mails that I had stored in no other location.Those security lapses are my fault, and I deeply, deeply regret them.But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Appleâ€™s and Amazonâ€™s. Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information â€” a partial credit card number â€” that Apple used to release information. In short, the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification. The disconnect exposes flaws in data management policies endemic to the entire technology industry, and points to a looming nightmare as we enter the era of cloud computing and connected devices.This isnâ€™t just my problem. Since Friday, Aug. 3, when hackers broke into my accounts, Iâ€™ve heard from other users who were compromised in the same way, at least one of whom was targeted by the same group.â€¬Moreover, if your computers arenâ€™t already cloud-connected devices, they will be soon. Apple is working hard to get all of its customers to use iCloud. Googleâ€™s entire operating system is cloud-based. And Windows 8, the most cloud-centric operating system yet, will hit desktops by the tens of millions in the coming year. My experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures. Password-based security mechanisms â€” which can be cracked, reset, and socially engineered â€” no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing.I realized something was wrong at about 5 p.m. on Friday. I was playing with my daughter when my iPhone suddenly powered down. I was expecting a call, so I went to plug it back in.It then rebooted to the setup screen. This was irritating, but I wasnâ€™t concerned. I assumed it was a software glitch. And, my phone automatically backs up every night. I just assumed it would be a pain in the ass, and nothing more. I entered my iCloud login to restore, and it wasnâ€™t accepted. Again, I was irritated, but not alarmed.Â I went to connect the iPhone to my computer and restore from that backup â€” which I had just happened to do the other day. When I opened my laptop, an iCal message popped up telling me that my Gmail account information was wrong. Then the screen went gray, and asked for a four-digit PIN.By now, I knew something was very, very wrong. For the first time it occurred to me that I was being hacked. Unsure of exactly what was happening, I unplugged my router and cable modem, turned off the Mac Mini we use as an entertainment center, grabbed my wifeâ€™s phone, and called AppleCare, the companyâ€™s tech support service, and spoke with a rep for the next hour and a half.It wasnâ€™t the first call they had had that day about my account. In fact, I later found out that a call had been placed just a little more than a half an hour before my own. But the Apple rep didnâ€™t bother to tell me about the first call concerning my account, despite the 90 minutes I spent on the phone with tech support. Nor would Apple tech support ever tell me about the first call voluntarily â€” it only shared this information after I asked about it. And I only knew about the first call because a hacker told me he had made the call himself.At 4:33 p.m., according to Appleâ€™s tech support records, someone called AppleCare claiming to be me. Apple says the caller reported that he couldnâ€™t get into his Me.com e-mail â€” which, of course was my Me.com e-mail.In response, Apple issued a temporary password. It did this despite the callerâ€™s inability to answer security questions I had set up. And it did this after the hacker supplied only two pieces of information that anyone with an internet connection and a phone can discover.At 4:50 p.m., a password reset confirmation arrived in my inbox. I donâ€™t really use my me.com e-mail, and rarely check it. But even if I did, I might not have noticed the message because the hackers immediately sent it to the trash. They then were able to follow the link in that e-mail to permanently reset my AppleID password.At 4:52 p.m., a Gmail password recovery e-mail arrived in my me.com mailbox. Two minutes later, another e-mail arrived notifying me that my Google account password had changed.Â At 5:02 p.m., they reset my Twitter password. At 5:00 they used iCloudâ€™s â€œFind Myâ€? tool to remotely wipe my iPhone. At 5:01 they remotely wiped my iPad. At 5:05 they remotely wiped my MacBook. Around this same time, they deleted my Google account. At 5:10, I placed the call to AppleCare. At 5:12 the attackers posted a message to my account on Twitter taking credit for the hack.By wiping my MacBook and deleting my Google account, they now not only had the ability to control my account, but were able to prevent me from regaining access. And crazily, in ways that I donâ€™t and never will understand, those deletions were just collateral damage. My MacBook data â€” including those irreplaceable pictures of my family, of my childâ€™s first year and relatives who have now passed from this life â€” werenâ€™t the target. Nor were the eight years of messages in my Gmail account. The target was always Twitter. My MacBook data was torched simply to prevent me from getting back in.I spent an hour and a half talking to AppleCare. One of the reasons it took me so long to get anything resolved with Apple during my initial phone call was because I couldnâ€™t answer the security questions it had on file for me. It turned out thereâ€™s a good reason for that. Perhaps an hour or so into the call, the Apple representative on the line said â€œMr. Herman, Iâ€¦.â€?â€œWait. What did you call me?â€?â€œMy name is Honan.â€?Apple had been looking at the wrong account all along. Because of that, I couldnâ€™t answer my security questions. And because of that, it asked me an alternate set of questions that it said would let tech support let me into my me.com account: a billing address and the last four digits of my credit card. (Of course, when I gave them those, it was no use, because tech support had misheard my last name.)It turns out, a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card number are the only two pieces of information anyone needs to get into your iCloud account. Once supplied, Apple will issue a temporary password, and that password grants access to iCloud.Apple tech support confirmed to me twice over the weekend that all you need to access someoneâ€™s AppleID is the associated e-mail address, a credit card number, the billing address, and the last four digits of a credit card on file. I was very clear about this. During my second tech support call to AppleCare, the representative confirmed this to me. â€œThatâ€™s really all you have to have to verify something with us,â€? he said.We talked to Apple directly about its security policy, and company spokesperson Natalie Kerris told Wired, â€œApple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password. In this particular case, the customerâ€™s data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer. In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely. We are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customersâ€™ data is protected.â€?On Monday, Wired tried to verify the hackersâ€™ access technique by performing it on a different account. We were successful. This means, ultimately, all you need in addition to someoneâ€™s e-mail address are those two easily acquired pieces of information: a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card on file. Hereâ€™s the story of how the hackers got them.On the night of the hack, I tried to make sense of the ruin that was my digital life. My Google account was nuked, my Twitter account was suspended, my phone was in a useless state of restore, and (for obvious reasons) I was highly paranoid about using my Apple email account for communication.I decided to set up a new Twitter account until my old one could be restored, just to let people know what was happening. I logged into Tumblr and posted an account of how I thought the takedown occurred. At this point, I was assuming that my seven-digit alphanumeric AppleID password had been hacked by brute force. In the comments (and, oh, the comments) others guessed that hackers had used some sort of keystroke logger. At the end of the post, I linked to my new Twitter account.And then, one of my hackers @ messaged me. He would later identify himself as Phobia. I followed him. He followed me back.We started a dialogue via Twitter direct messaging that later continued via e-mail and AIM. Phobia was able to reveal enough detail about the hack and my compromised accounts that it became clear he was, at the very least, a party to how it went down. I agreed not to press charges, and in return he laid out exactly how the hack worked. But first, he wanted to clear something up:â€œdidnt guess ur password or use bruteforce. i have my own guide on how to secure emails.â€?I asked him why. Was I targeted specifically? Was this just to get to Gizmodoâ€™s Twitter account? No, Phobia said they hadnâ€™t even been aware that my account was linked to Gizmodoâ€™s, that the Gizmodo linkage was just gravy. He said the hack was simply a grab for my three-character Twitter handle. Thatâ€™s all they wanted. They just wanted to take it, and fuck shit up, and watch it burn. It wasnâ€™t personal.â€œI honestly didnâ€™t have any heat towards you before this. i just liked your username like I said beforeâ€? he told me via Twitter Direct Message.After coming across my account, the hackers did some background research. My Twitter account linked to my personal website, where they found my Gmail address. Guessing that this was also the e-mail address I used for Twitter, Phobia went to Googleâ€™s account recovery page. He didnâ€™t even have to actually attempt a recovery. This was just a recon mission.Because I didnâ€™t have Googleâ€™s two-factor authentication turned on, when Phobia entered my Gmail address, he could view the alternate e-mail I had set up for account recovery. Google partially obscures that information, starring out many characters, but there were enough characters available, mâ€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢n@me.com. Jackpot.This was how the hack progressed. If I had some other account aside from an Apple e-mail address, or had used two-factor authentication for Gmail, everything would have stopped here. But using that Apple-run me.com e-mail account as a backup meant told the hacker I had an AppleID account, which meant I was vulnerable to being hacked.â€œYou honestly can get into any email associated with apple,â€? Phobia claimed in an e-mail. And while itâ€™s work, that seems to be largely true.Since he already had the e-mail, all he needed was my billing address and the last four digits of my credit card number to have Appleâ€™s tech support issue him the keys to my account.So how did he get this vital information? He began with the easy one. He got the billing address by doing a whois search on my personal web domain. If someone doesnâ€™t have a domain, you can also look up his or her information on Spokeo, WhitePages, and PeopleSmart.Getting a credit card number is tricker, but it also relies on taking advantage of a companyâ€™s back-end systems. Phobia says that a partner performed this part of the hack, but described the technique to us, which we were able to verify via our own tech support phone calls. Itâ€™s remarkably easy â€” so easy that Wired was able to duplicate the exploit twice in minutes.First you call Amazon and tell them you are the account holder, and want to add a credit card number to the account. All you need is the name on the account, an associated e-mail address, and the billing address. Amazon then allows you to input a new credit card. (Wired used a bogus credit card number from a website that generates fake card numbers that conform with the industryâ€™s published self-check algorithm.) Then you hang up.Next you call back, and tell Amazon that youâ€™ve lost access to your account. Upon providing a name, billing address, and the new credit card number you gave the company on the prior call, Amazon will allow you to add a new e-mail address to the account. From here, you go to the Amazon website, and send a password reset to the new e-mail account. This allows you to see all the credit cards on file for the account â€” not the complete numbers, just the last four digits. But, as we know, Apple only needs those last four digits. We asked Amazon to comment on its security policy, but didnâ€™t have anything to share by press time.And itâ€™s also worth noting that one wouldnâ€™t have to call Amazon to pull this off. Your pizza guy could do the same thing, for example. If you have an AppleID, every time you call Pizza Hut, youâ€™ve giving the 16-year-old on the other end of the line all he needs to take over your entire digital life.And so, with my name, address, and the last four digits of my credit card number in hand, Phobia called AppleCare, and my digital life was laid waste. Yet still I was actually quite fortunate.They could have used my e-mail accounts to gain access to my online banking, or financial services. They could have used them to contact other people, and socially engineer them as well. As Ed Bott pointed out on TWiT.tv, my years as a technology journalist have put some very influential people in my address book. They could have been victimized too.Instead, the hackers just wanted to embarrass me, have some fun at my expense, and enrage my followers on Twitter by trolling.I had done some pretty stupid things. Things you shouldnâ€™t do.I should have been regularly backing up my MacBook. Because I wasnâ€™t doing that, if all the photos from the first year and a half of my daughterâ€™s life are ultimately lost, I will have only myself to blame. I shouldnâ€™t have daisy-chained two such vital accounts â€” my Google and my iCloud account â€” together. I shouldnâ€™t have used the same e-mail prefix across multiple accounts â€” mhonan@gmail.com, mhonan@me.com, and mhonan@wired.com. And I should have had a recovery address thatâ€™s only used for recovery without being tied to core services.But, mostly, I shouldnâ€™t have used Find My Mac. Find My iPhone has been a brilliant Apple service. If you lose your iPhone, or have it stolen, the service lets you see where it is on a map. The New York Timesâ€™ David Pogue recovered his lost iPhone just last week thanks to the service. And so, when Apple introduced Find My Mac in the update to its Lion operating system last year, I added that to my iCloud options too.After all, as a reporter, often on the go, my laptop is my most important tool.But as a friend pointed out to me, while that service makes sense for phones (which are quite likely to be lost) it makes less sense for computers. You are almost certainly more likely to have your computer accessed remotely than physically. And even worse is the way Find My Mac is implemented.When you perform a remote hard drive wipe on Find my Mac, the system asks you to create a four-digit PIN so that the process can be reversed. But hereâ€™s the thing: If someone else performs that wipe â€” someone who gained access to your iCloud account through malicious means â€” thereâ€™s no way for you to enter that PIN.A better way to have this set up would be to require a second method of authentication when Find My Mac is initially set up. If this were the case, someone who was able to get into an iCloud account wouldnâ€™t be able to remotely wipe devices with malicious intent. It would also mean that you could potentially have a way to stop a remote wipe in progress.But thatâ€™s not how it works. And Apple would not comment as to whether stronger authentification is being considered.As of Monday, both of these exploits used by the hackers were still functioning. Wired was able to duplicate them. Apple says its internal tech support processes werenâ€™t followed, and this is how my account was compromised. However, this contradicts what AppleCare told me twice that weekend. If that is, in fact, the case â€” that I was the victim of Apple not following its own internal processes â€” then the problem is widespread.I asked Phobia why he did this to me. His answer wasnâ€™t satisfying. He says he likes to publicize security exploits, so companies will fix them. He says itâ€™s the same reason he told me how it was done. He claims his partner in the attack was the person who wiped my MacBook. Phobia expressed remorse for this, and says he would have stopped it had he known.â€œyea i really am a nice guy idk why i do some of the things i do,â€? he told me via AIM. â€œidk my goal is to get it out there to other people so eventually every1 can over come hackersâ€?I asked specifically about the photos of my little girl, which are, to me, the greatest tragedy in all this. Unless I can recover those photos via data recovery services, they are gone forever. On AIM, I asked him if he was sorry for doing that. Phobia replied, â€œeven though i wasnt the one that did it i feel sorry about that. Thats alot of memories im only 19 but if my parents lost and the footage of me and pics i would be beyond sad and im sure they would be too.â€?But letâ€™s say he did know, and failed to stop it. Hell, for the sake of argument, letâ€™s say he did it. Letâ€™s say he pulled the trigger. The weird thing is, Iâ€™m not even especially angry at Phobia, or his partner in the attack. Iâ€™m mostly mad at myself. Iâ€™m mad as hell for not backing up my data. Iâ€™m sad, and shocked, and feel that I am ultimately to blame for that loss.But Iâ€™m also upset that this ecosystem that Iâ€™ve placed so much of my trust in has let me down so thoroughly. Iâ€™m angry that Amazon makes it so remarkably easy to allow someone into your account, which has obvious financial consequences. And then thereâ€™s Apple. I bought into the Apple account system originally to buy songs at 99 cents a pop, and over the years that same ID has evolved into a single point of entry that controls my phones, tablets, computers and data-driven life. With this AppleID, someone can make thousands of dollars of purchases in an instant, or do damage at a cost that you canâ€™t put a price on.Additional reporting by Roberto Baldwin and Christina Bonnington.

Envision this: you're at a Halloween party, a little drunk, a little bored. You don't recognize anyone's costumes around you except the third, fourth, and fifth Psy you've seen that night, all doing the Gangnam style dance together. Your eyes pass over a seemingly innocuous pumpkin decoration. But waitâ€”is that a Tetris matrix carved into its face? Is the stem a joystick? Are you in discreet gaming heaven?Nathan Pryor of Hahabird initially aspired to grow several pumpkins into the shape of Tetris blocks (Tetrominos). But when that didn't pan out, he simply used an Arduino to turn a carved pumpkin into a compact gaming cabinet. Behold: a Pumpktris.Initially Pryor planned to use a LoLShield LED matrix as the pumpkin's display, but each LED needed two wires to run to the Arduino board powering the game. The bundle would have been enormousâ€”and a mess. So to make the display, Pryor built and wired his own (appropriately orange) 8Ã—16 LED matrix and carved out 128 holes for each light on the face of an appropriately-shaped pumpkin. He also programmed the Arduino board true to the game's rules, with pieces that fall with increasing speed as the level goes up, as well as a scorekeeping element.Pryor told Ars the entire project cost about $100 altogether (including Arduino, LEDs, LED controllers, joystick assembly, and four pumpkinsâ€”three of which he had to reject due to suboptimal shape). In all it took twelve hours to build. That means there's still time before your Halloween celebration tomorrow to make a Pumpktris. Use it to impress your friends, or ignore themâ€”the Pumpktris does not judge.

A key part of any cybersecurity plan is â€œcontinuous monitoringâ€?, or enabling auditing and monitoring throughout a network environment and configuring automated analysis of the resulting logs to identify anomalous behaviors that merit investigation. This is part of the new â€œassumed breachâ€? mentality that recognizes no system is 100% secure. Unfortunately, the company at the heart of this case didnâ€™t have a comprehensive monitoring system, so had been breached for some time before updated antimalware signatures cleaned their infection and brought the breach to their attention. Besides highlighting just how weak cybersecurity is at many companies, this case highlights the use of several Sysinternals Process Monitor features, including the Process Tree dialog and one feature many people arenâ€™t aware of, Process Monitorâ€™s ability to monitor network activity.The case opened when a network administrator at a South African company contacted Microsoft Services Premier Support and reported that their corporate Exchange server, running on Windows Server 2008 R2, appeared to be making outbound FTP connections. They noticed this only because the companyâ€™s installation of Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Protection (FEP) alerted them that it had cleaned a piece of malware it found on the server. Concerned that their network might still be compromised despite the fact that FEP claimed the system was malware-free, he examined the companyâ€™s perimeter firewall logs. To his horror, he discovered FTP connections that numbered in the hundreds per day and dated back several weeks. Instead of attempting a forensic examination on his own, he called on Microsoftâ€™s security consulting team, which specializes in helping customers clean up after an attack.The Microsoft support engineer assigned the case began by capturing a five-minute Process Monitor trace of the Exchange server. After stopping the trace he opened the Process Tree dialog (under the Tools menu), which shows the parent-child relationships of all the processes that existed at any point in the current trace. He quickly found that around 20 FTP processes had been launched during the collection, each of them short-lived, except for one, which was still active (process 7324 below):The engineer looked at the command lines for the FTP processes by selecting them in the tree so that their details appeared at the bottom of the Process Tree dialog. The command lines for the half of them bizarrely included just the â€œ-?â€? argument, which simply brings up FTP help:The other half were more interesting, including â€œ-iâ€? and â€œ-sâ€? switches:The â€“i switch has FTP turn off prompting for multiple file transfers, and â€“s directs FTP to execute the FTP commands listed in a file, in this case a file named â€œjâ€?.Â  Setting out to find out what file 'â€?jâ€? contained, he clicked on the â€œInclude Processâ€? button at the bottom of the Process Tree dialog so that he could find the processâ€™s file events:He searched the resulting filtered trace for â€œjâ€? and found the fileâ€™s location in several of the events:He navigated to the C:\Windows\System32\i4333 directory, but the â€œjâ€? file was gone. That being a dead end, he turned his attention to the FTP processâ€™s parent, Cmd.exe, and looked at its command line. The line was too long and convoluted to easily understand:He selected it, typed Ctrl+C to copy it to the clipboard, pasted it into Notepad, and decomposed it into its constituent components, each of which was separated by a â€œ&â€?. The result looked like this:The first instruction has the command prompt create a directory named i4333 and then start creating the contents of the â€œjâ€? file. The commands it writes into â€œjâ€? instruct FTP to connect to NUXZb.in.into4.info, login with the user name â€œNewâ€? and the password â€œ123â€?, then download all the files on the FTP server that end with â€œ.exeâ€?. After FTP has processed the file, the command prompt deletes â€œjâ€? and then creates a batch file that executes the downloaded files, first using the Shell to launch them (â€œstartâ€?) and then the Command Prompt.A quick detour to Whois showed the engineer that the NUXZb hostname was issued by Protected Name Services and didnâ€™t reveal any useful information. The engineer toggled off Process Monitorâ€™s network name resolution and found the outbound FTP connection in the trace to see the IP address the name had resolved to:An IP address location lookup on the Web pinpointed the IP address at an ISP in Chicago (the name now resolves to a different IP address), so he concluded the connection was to a server that was also compromised or one the attacker had hosted at the ISP. Finished analyzing the command line, he looked at the contents of the resulting script, D.bat, which was still in the directory and contained this single command:Not coincidentally, 134.exe was the executable Forefront had flagged as a remote access Trojan (RAT) in the alerts that the administrator first responded to. The script could therefore not find it, making it seem that the attack â€“ or at least this part of it - had been neutralized by FEP. It also implied that the attack was automated and stuck in a loop trying to activate.The engineer next set out to determine how the command-prompt processes were being launched. Looking at their parent processes in the process tree, he learned they were all launched from Sqlserver.exe:This obviously wasnâ€™t a good sign, but it wasnâ€™t the worst of it: examining SQL Serverâ€™s network activity in the trace, he saw many incoming connections:Lookups of the IP address locations placed them in China, Tunisia, Taiwan, and Morocco:The SQL Server was being used by an attacker or multiple attackers from around the world in countries known for being cybercriminal safe havens. It was clearly time to flatten the server, but before calling the administrator to give him the bad news and advise him to immediately disconnect the server from the network, he thought heâ€™d spend a few minutes examining the security of the SQL Server. Understanding what had led to the compromise could help the company avoid being compromised the same way again.He launched a Microsoft support batch file that checks various SQL Server security settings. The tool ran for a few seconds and then printed its discouraging results: the server had an administrator account with a blank password, was configured for mixed-mode authentication, and allowed stored procedures to launch command prompts via the enablement of the â€œxp_cmdshellâ€? feature:That meant that anyone on the Internet could logon to the server without a password and execute executables â€“ like FTP â€“ to infect the system with their own tools.With the help of Process Monitor and some discussion with the companyâ€™s administrator, the support engineer had a solid theory for what had happened: an administrator at the company had installed SQL Server on the companyâ€™s Exchange server several weeks prior to the incident. Not realizing the server was on the perimeter, they had opened the SQL Serverâ€™s port in the local firewall, left it with a blank admin account, and enabled xp_cmdshell. It goes without saying that even if the server wasnâ€™t on the Internet, that configuration leaves a server without any network security. Not long after, automated malware scanning the Internet for exposed targets had stumbled across the open SQL port, infected the server with malware, and likely enlisted it in a Botnet. FEP signatures for the new malware variant were delivered to the server some time later and removed the infection. The Botnet-enlisting malware was still trying to reintegrate the server when the case with Microsoft support was opened. While the company canâ€™t know how much â€“ if any â€“ of its corporate data was pilfered during the infection, this was a very loud and clear wakeup call.You can test your own cybersecurity knowledge by taking my Operation Desolation cybersecurity quiz.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A number of popular websites went down late Monday after Superstorm Sandy took out a major Internet service provider.The Huffington Post, Gawker and many other sites were unreachable after Datagram, a New York-based provider of corporate Internet connections and servers, said it was battling flooding in its offices. The floods caused Datagram's fiber network to lose power, and the company said its backup generators were rendered useless because the diesel fuel pumps used to refuel generators were offline.Datagram is located on 33 Whitehall Street in Battery Park -- a large area of reclaimed land at the southern tip of Manhattan that was in an evacuation zone. It was among the worst-hit areas in the city.BuzzFeed, another Datagram customer, was able to get its site back up online and running Tuesday afternoon.On its Tumblr page, the company said Datagram told its staff that its basement was flooded with five feet of water. A Datagram representative was unreachable for comment.Many sites were updating their status on Twitter and publishing news stories on Tumblr accounts.Gawker was completely unreachable Tuesday morning."Gawker is temporarily down because the 57th Street Crane just flooded our servers with sea foam, or something," the company posted on Twitter. "Back with you shortly."The Huffington Post's site was down Tuesday morning, but it automatically redirected to a company blog. "We are working around the clock to get the site back to normal," the news organization, owned by AOL (AOL), noted. AOL's site was unaffected by the storm. The site came back online around noon ET.Cloud storage company Internap, located just four blocks away from Datagram, also flooded and was unable to refuel its generators. The company issued an emergency notification to customers suggesting they back up their data and make contingency plans.

What do you get when you combine a pumpkin with the classic video game Tetris? Pumpktris! Fully playable, embedded in a pumpkin, and with the stem serving as a controller. Watch the video below to see it in action, then read on for the development story.One of my habits is to write down all the crazy, fleeting ideas I have, then go back to review later rather than judging right off the bat, or even worse, forgetting them. Â Earlier in the month I was looking through that idea notepad and found â€œMake Tetris Pumpkinsâ€? from sometime last year. My original plan had been to make forms to shape pumpkins into Tetris pieces as they grew, then stack them together for Halloween. Since Halloween was only a few weeks away and it was too late to start growing pumpkins, I thought â€œWhy not make a pumpkin you can play Tetris on instead?â€?I had a LOLShield I hadnâ€™t assembled yet, and I knew that someone had already written Tetris for it, so I figured it would be a simple matter to poke some holes in the pumpkin to match the LEDs, make a controller, and be done. But oh no, that would be too simple, and would look kind of lame. Little tiny LEDs, all stuck together on a 2Ã—3â€³ area? Nahhhh.Plan B: Still use the LOLshield, but instead of mounting LEDs in the shield I would wire them up externally so I could space them out more on the pumpkin. Luckily, I didnâ€™t get too far down that route before I realized that the bundle of wires between the LEDs and the shield would be as thick as my wrist and a nightmare to solder and organize.I was going to have to make my own LED matrix and program my own Tetris. With the decision made, I ordered 140 amber LEDs from Mouser and a pair of LED Matrix I2C â€œbackpacksâ€? from Adafruit. These little circuits come with a mini (.8â€³ square) LED matrix that I could use for programming instead of having to wire up my own LED matrix right from the start..The first step was to make the LED matrix, and for that Iâ€™m grateful to have found this guide on hackaday.com to making a 70 LED matrix. My construction steps were essentially the same (plus 58 more LEDs), but Iâ€™ll go through them here anyway. For more theory, check out their post. Mine leans toward â€œwhat I didâ€? rather than â€œwhy you should do it this way.â€?It started with cutting 112 pieces of 2.5â€³ wire and 16 pieces of 8â€³ wire. The short ones would go between each LED, and the long ones would run to the controller. A cutting mat made it easy to quickly and accurately measure out the lengths.Next I soldered seven short wires and one long one into a daisy chain. Then again 15 more timesâ€”one for each row and one for each column in the matrix.A jig was needed for assembly, and here I differed from Hackaday. Instead of drilling hardboard, I opted to poke holes into 1/4â€³ foam-core board with an awl. It was a lot quicker than a drill would be, and the foam-core board had a little bit of give so that I could make the holes small and theyâ€™d stretch out to hold the LED securely while I soldered.With a row of LEDS poked into holes, I tinned the base of each anode and clipped it short, then soldered the wire daisy-chain down the line. At each joint I slipped on a half-inch of heat-shrink tubing before soldering. Iâ€™m proud to say there were only a couple of times I forgot the heat-shrink and had to go back. What caused more trouble was being in a hurry and sliding the tubing down to the joint while it was still hot. It would start to shrink up and wouldnâ€™t fit over the connection on the LEDs.When eight rows of LEDs were finally strung together, it was time to mount them all into the jig and solder on the cathode columns. The procedure with the heat-shrink was the same. As each column was finished I would pull it out of the jig and fold it out of the way in order to reach the next column.But guess what? Thatâ€™s only one, and 8Ã—8 isnâ€™t enough room for a game of Tetris, so it all got done again! Iâ€™ll spare you a rerun on the pictures and description, but if you want to you can go back up and read it again to get the full experience.TheÂ Adafruit LED Matrix BackpackÂ is meant to have its LED matrix soldered right to the board, but instead I soldered on female headers that would permit me to plug in either the mini LED matrix for code testing or the large matrix for deployment. Someone will probably be along to tell me I need a resistor here or there or Iâ€™m going to blow some chip upâ€”and theyâ€™re likely rightâ€”but it seems to have worked so far as-is.To connect my own matrix to the I2C Backpack, I cut down a piece of prototyping board and soldered in the male headers, then connected the 8â€³ wires from the last row and last column of the matrix to the board.Would it work, though? I needed some code in order to find out.I did all coding with the hardware mounted on my bamboo prototyping board. The mini matrices in the I2C backpack sockets fit on the desk much better than the big, floppy matrices I built would have.There are seven Tetrominosâ€”yes, thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re calledâ€”in the game. Each has four points, as implied by the â€œtetraâ€? prefix. A three-dimensional array stores the location of every pixel of every shape, in each of four possible rotations. Storing each rotation is a lot easier (for my brain at least) than calculating it on the fly. As an example, hereâ€™s the T shape:To draw the active piece the program keeps an activePiece variable (the index of the shape in the array) and a rotation variable (the index of the rotation description of that shape), then offsets each pixel pair that it pulls out by a yOffset and xOffset of how far down the screen itâ€™s moved and how far left or right.It also keeps an array describing the status of each â€œfixedâ€? piece. With every move of the active piece, whether by gravity or by user control, it checks against that fixed-piece array to see if the requested move can be made without a collision. If the forbidden movement is left, right, or a rotation, it simply doesnâ€™t make the move. If the forbidden movement is vertical it considers the piece to have landed and writes the piece to the array of fixed pieces, then launches a new active piece. Along the way it keeps score, tracks the level, speeds up the drop of the active piece as the game goes on, etc.This project required the perfect arcade cabinetâ€”errr, I mean pumpkin. It had to be tall enough that the eight-inch tall matrix wouldnâ€™t wrap too far around the bottom or top, and it needed a nice straight stem. I bought 3 pumpkins in a row, thinking each was perfect until I got it home and realized one thing or another wouldnâ€™t work. Finally I found what I needed and the other pumpkins were relegated to pro
