The search and software giant says it has hit the new milestone for programs available for Android. By comparison, Microsoft has 120,000.

Google has hit another milestone for Android apps, and this one is pretty big news for Apple too.

The number of apps available for Android now totals about 700,000, a Google spokesman confirmed to CNET. That's up from the 675,000the company said it had a month ago.

And it equals the figure Apple most recently touted. The Cupertino, Calif., company first revealed it had about 700,000 apps available in its store last month, and Apple reiterated that amount during the iPad Mini launch last week.

The number of apps offered for an operating system is an important factor for driving user adoption. Apple had long led the rest of the market, but Google had been quickly catch up. By comparison, Microsoft said yesterday that it now has 120,000 apps for it Windows Phone OS. That's a pretty big figure for the company but it significantly lags Android and iOS.
