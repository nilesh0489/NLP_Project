AMD Changes Compute Landscape: First to Deliver both x86 and ARM Processors for the Data Center

On October 29, 2012, AMD announced it will design 64-bit ARM® technology-based processors in addition to its x86 processors for multiple markets, starting with cloud and data center servers.

Just as AMD introduced the industry’s first mainstream 64-bit x86 server solution with the AMD Opteron™ processor in 2003, AMD will be the only processor provider bridging the x86 and 64-bit ARM ecosystems to enable new levels of flexibility and drive optimal performance and power efficiency.

AMD is uniquely positioned to offer the most flexible and complete processing solutions for the modern data center based on the company’s deep 64-bit processor knowledge, years of server development experience, and industry-leading AMD SeaMicro Freedom™ supercompute fabric.

AMD’s first ARM-based server CPU is targeted for production in 2014.
