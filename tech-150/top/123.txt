Ok, so this app made me feel really dirty when I downloaded it. It’s called Badabing! and it basically goes through your friends’ photos on Facebook to pull out the ones of them at the pool or beach. In other words, we’re talking about scantily clad photos here.

I of course, for the sake of technology journalism, had to download the app and give it a whirl. It actually kind of works and it’s really creepy. To protect the innocent, I’m not going to post any actual screenshots of my Facebook friends. They’d kill me. And probably the folks who made this app.

The app is $1.99 and all you have to do is log in with your Facebook account and then choose a few friends to dig up some dirt on. The company has some sort of image recognition technology that looks for…skin?

After your search is complete you can bookmark your favorite photos. Now let’s get to the heart of the matter, is this wrong to do? I mean, technically, your friends have uploaded these photos and shared them with you anyway. All this app does is do a search, albeit a search with icky intent.

Moral of the story, don’t upload photos to Facebook and share them with friends unless you want them looking at them. Especially if you’re in a bikini or tight swim trunks.

Creep you out? Cool use of tech? Tell us in the comments.
