But names can never hurt me

My bf is working in Abu Dhabi

I hope you get your wish. If you have any more wishes, could you wish that this fucking war ends immediately?

* Droog4 kicked by KillaZ (do you use that mouth to kiss your mom?)

{arrow} this is the first amarican i see like to stop the war

{Droog4} hmmmm i guess for the last 5 years of the Vietnam War lots of people were saying: Well, you're right, this really is a sucky terrible war, but we can't back out now.

{Droog4} okay i am gonna find some other Commie Pinko Lefty Peaceniks to talk to about ending this fu**ing war like by tomorrow at 9:30 am

got disconnected but managed to get back on Undernet]

here a big Lag (delay) tsunami hit Undernet. I could tell I was still connected, but it was taking a long time -- minutes or longer -- for anyone to get my messages or reply to them. But before I left ...

and I never saw his nick on Undernet again, but that doesn't mean anything, there are typically 50,000 people on Undernet at any given moment. But I never saw Ygor again.What hurts the most are the vile threats and insults hurling back and forth through the Chat-o-Sphere in times of war. It's still much better than the actual warbut there is a huge volume of particularly ugly hatred especially reserved for Peace Assholes like me. A Hezbollah guy would rather French-kiss an Israeli soldier than read Peace Crap from anybody, and ditto the feelings of an IDF soldier.Once war starts, it's like when sex starts -- nobody wants it interrupted or stopped. It just feels so good, you want it to just go on and on and on and on and on. Peace doesn't offer any emotions that feel nearly as good.Peace is complicated and confusing. Israeli Jews will have to learn how to be day-to-day neighbors with Palestinian and Arab Muslims. Hezbollah will have to learn how to be day-to-day neighbors with Lebanese Christians and Druse. Shia and Sunni will have to go shopping for groceries at the same market, without firearms. I'm not joking when I say that's going to be incredibly hard.War is simple and easy. It's so easy that the United Nations is trying to make every country and combatant on Earth stop using Child Soldiers younger than 16. Without much success. The government of Sri Lanka was just accused of using Child Soldiers, a nasty rap previously reserved for the Tamil Tigers. In Africa, the Lord's Resistance Army usually wins the prize for accusations of abducting children to be soldiers and sex slaves. The Lord's Resistance Army is a religious movement, and teaches the child soldiers that if they believe, enemy bullets cannot harm them.But war is so easy that little boys make excellent soldiers, and little boys and girls make excellent sex partners for older soldiers. You don't need to be mature to be an effective soldier; in fact maturity usually just gets in the way.Tonight's Relapse ... well, I really didn't want any war or any politics or any anger or any flame wars. I didn't want to read KILL THE JEWS or KILL THE FUCKING SAND NIGGERS. I just wanted some easy, fun, innocent chat, so I didn't click on any of the Hot Button chatrooms. seemed safe. I'd been there before, and it's usually all and and and We somehow began singing musical theater songs from "My Fair Lady," and it was all very pleasant, but then I lost the first half of my chat because we were chatting about doors, and said she wished that someday she'd have a house with a purple front door, so I saidand the Bot instantly kicked me off the channel for using the F-word, and that means I lost the first 20 minutes of my #worldchat. But I was just kicked in the teeth, not banned forever, so I was able to re-join immediately.Meanwhile a boy from Jordan named was struggling along with some pretty bad English, but as it turned out, he reads and understands English a lot better than he types it.Jordan is almost entirely Arab and Muslim.Its next-door neighbors are . There's no war in Jordan. It even has a peace treaty with Israel. War in Iraq, war in Lebanon, but Jordan itself has stayed pretty peaceful, or at least pretty Lo-Violence. Not an easy trick. Uneasy lies the head that wears that crown.But please note so many interesting things more than my bad manners and vulgar mouth.See all these people from all over the , from every Time Zone, just chatting (or trying to chat) with each other.Here I am in Northampton Massachusetts USA, and in this little college town I could get on the phone and have 50 Lefty Peacenik Quaker Commies in my living room in a half-hour.The Congressional election a few weeks ago made it abundantly and noisily clear that all over the United States of America there are people who are very pissed off about the War in Iraq.But read on down to what the Jordanian kid typed.He has a computer. He has a television. He has a radio. He has a phone. His English is pretty competent.But read on down to what typed.******** Now talking in #worldchat* Topic is 'Welcome to #Worldchat (http://www.worldchat.org) enjoy your stay.'* Set by KillaZ on Sun Nov 19 11:29:35{Droog4} whoops sorry{girlscout} hehe{gumnaam} salaam* catty_29 has quit IRC (Quit){girlscout} people need to believe in it again for it to stop{Droog4} salaam gumnaam* ieza80 has joined #worldchat{gumnaam} h r u{Droog4} pretty good gumnaam how r u, did you have good Ramadan and Eid?* SwEeTy_InDiG has left #worldchat* Fevil has left #worldchat{gumnaam} yup{Droog4} excellent{gumnaam} where u from* ieza80 has quit IRC (Quit)* X sets mode: +l 68{Droog4} USA, sorta near Boston{Droog4} u in PK?* neat40 has joined #worldchat{gumnaam} yup{gumnaam} in karachi{girlscout} what's boston like?* neat40 has left #worldchat{Droog4} oh actually it's a real interesting and entertaining city{girlscout} I have never been there* Fevil has joined #worldchat{gumnaam} yaaaaaaa{Droog4} lot of Big Brain Places there, MIT, Harvard{gumnaam} u r rite{girlscout} *nod** Fevil has left #worldchat{Droog4} aha gumnaam has been to Boston* SwEeTy_InDiG has joined #worldchat{gumnaam} ok{gumnaam} friend{gumnaam} i have to go{ashley} hi{Droog4} arrow i can fill a very big stadium with americans who want to stop the war{gumnaam} ALLAH HAFIZ to all{Droog4} salaam gumnaam{girlscout} they want to stop it for the wrong reasons though{arrow} droog4{Droog4} there is no wrong reason to stop any war* pink_24 has joined #worldchat{girlscout} I don't condone war in general* X sets mode: +l 70{girlscout} but what's done is done{girlscout} it seems even worse to back out now* Droog4 confesses he is a bit of a peacenik refusenik commie pinko lefty* Bojan_ww has joined #worldchat{gumnaam} droog ALLAH HAFIZ answer is ALLAH HAFIZ* pink_24 has left #worldchat{gumnaam} not salaam{Droog4} gumnaam thank you for the free lesson, i really need it, my Urdu really sux{gumnaam} okz{girlscout} lol{gumnaam} ALLAH HAFIZ{briar} hi{Droog4} Allah Hafiz to you also{gumnaam} girlscout y u laghing{girlscout} just because{Droog4} girlscout is guessing i know zero words of Urdu{gumnaam} dont laugh* girlscout chuckles{girlscout} why not?{girlscout} don't tell me what I can and cannot do{girlscout} I happen to like to laugh* isloo has joined #worldchat{girlscout} heh* zeek has joined #worldchat* X sets mode: +l 72* KFEPKFEW has joined #worldchat{GrimLurkin} Group hug my ass.
