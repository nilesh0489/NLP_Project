This was aired in either 1991 (according to trash0) or 1987-8 (according to Barry VK2FP). Regardless, Julie (also famously known as "The Batman" on Sydney Australia CB radio in the early 1970s) passed away in 2006, but this was him at his best and most typical. He's gone but will never be forgotten by anyone who knew him!18/8/12: I've uploaded 14 photos of Julius taken in the early 1970s, to my Picasa web album. See them at http://tinyurl.com/vk2xbr
