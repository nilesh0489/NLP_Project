The fact that I can go to a local electronics store and buy a brand new,fully functional cell phone for 15 EUR is the miracle.

In 5 years, what we consider now a "smartphone" will cost as much, and (mark my and other people's words on this) will be the number 1 proliferant of education in poorer countries, as will be ubiquitly installable cell network infrastructure.

BTW I get no karma for this post, so upvote or downvote as you think.
