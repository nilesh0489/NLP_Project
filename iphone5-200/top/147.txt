Yesterday, as promised, Mozilla released FireFox 3.5 for all users. The updated browser is said to be the fastest FireFox browser yet, and also includes enhanced security features. Also, late last night, Apple released iPhone 3.1 SDK software to developers so the apps they design will fit the new upgrade when Apple releases it. New features coming and it’s only been 2 weeks since the iPhone 3Gs was released. Pretty nifty.

“When is a point update not just a point update? When itâ€™s a point-five release, naturally. On Tuesday, Mozilla released Firefox 3.5, the latest version of the popular open-source Web browser, bringing joy into the hearts of children and adults alike.

Besides sporting a fancy revised icon by the Iconfactory, Firefox 3.5 brings several new features to the program, including support for HTML5 video and audio content embedded directly on a page, a private browsing mode, and location-aware browsing, which allows you to share your location with Web sites if you so choose.

Arguably the biggest improvements in Firefox 3.5 are performance-based: the browserâ€™s developers boast that its JavaScript performance is more than twice as fast as Firefox 3, and ten times faster than Firefox 2, thanks to the new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine. The software also incorporates the latest version of the Gecko rendering platform, which brings faster rendering of onscreen content.

Originally, the 3.5 update was supposed to be version 3.1, but in March, Mozilla decided to change the version numbering, believing that it better reflected the breadth of new features and functionality that the update brought.

A free download for all, Firefox 3.5 is available in more than 70 different languages. The program runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The Mac version requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later, any Mac with an Intel-based or G3, G4, or G5 processor, and at least 128MB of RAM.”

“Only two weeks after launching the 3.0 software update for iPhone and iPod Touch, Apple is now working hard on delivering an update to the iPhone OS. The iPhone SDK 3.1 beta has been pushed out to developers last night, which already reported a few new features and refinements.

Apple has not mentioned specifically the improvements in the iPhone 3.1 beta update, but numerous developers have downloaded the software and reported on forums and blogs some of the new things they discovered within the update.

At a first glance, reports say that the iPhone 3.1 improves Voice Control functionality (introduced with the iPhone 3GS), which now works over Bluetooth as well. Video editing on the iPhone 3GS is going to be improved also, as users will be able to save a copy of the original video before they start trimming.

Other visible user interface improvements reported include tactile feedback (vibration) when moving applications icons on the screen and paste capabilities in the dialer application. The dialer app will also convert alphanumeric numbers (such as 1-800-MY-APPLE) into regular phone numbers when pasted in.

Developers also found a few under-the-hood changes in the iPhone 3.1 software beta to the OpenGL and Quartz engines and an Video Editor Controller API, which allows third-party applications to call up the video editing interface.

The MMS functionality is enabled by default say developers, but it still doesn’t work for AT&T users in the US (although the AT&T profile was updated to 4.2). It is yet unclear whether this change signals that AT&T will enable MMS messaging as soon as the iPhone 3.1 software update is widely available to the public.

Apple has not said when a final version of the 3.1 software will be released to all iPhone users or whether this update addresses the latest iPhone 3GS overheating reports.”
