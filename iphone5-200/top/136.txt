Reports that the iPhone 5 will feature a Liquidmetal body have been dismissed by the inventor of the alloy technology.

Claims that Apple will ditch the iPhone 4S’s glass construction for a more robust, less scratch-prone Liquidmetal frame have been circulating for the best part of a month now.

The alloy is also purportedly easier to handle during manufacturing, while retaining the iPhone’s David Niven-smooth surfaces.

Sounds ace, no? Agreed. But we shouldn’t get too excited just yet, says Dr Atakan Peker.

According to the inventor of Liquidmetal, we shouldn’t expect the alloy to feature in the next-gen phone - chiefly because of the sheer scale of the task involved in readying Apple’s factories for the technology.

As well as this lack of a “suitable manufacturing infrastructure”, the fact that the tech is at a relatively nascent stage and "has yet to be matured and perfected both in manufacturing process and application development” also mitigates against it being present in the iPhone 5.

Apple, which inked a deal for the sole right to use Liquidmetal technology two years ago, is expected to unveil the sixth-generation iPhone later this year.
