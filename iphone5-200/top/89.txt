For those who don't know, Apple and AT&T removed an application that allowed your iPhone to interface with Google Voice. But, in removing GV Mobile from the app store, Apple has cut the application off from any future updates or bug fixes. The reality is that Apple took your money, and has interfered in your ability to get updates to a program you purchased.

If you ask for a refund, Apple will happily refund your money, but, here's the stark reality of such a decision... The author, who received 70% of the purchase price when you bought the software, now has to refund 100% of the purchase price when you ask for a refund. In real numbers, The author made $2.09 on a $2.99 program. But, we has to give BACK $2.99--actually costing the author 90 cents for you to get a refund! Apple keeps the 90 cents profit no matter what.

So, you want compensation, but you don't want to hurt the author? Here’s what I did.. This hurts APPLE and not the author! I called up apple corporate offices and told them that I want my money back as “compensation” — NOT as a refund. I was very specific that I did not want a refund on the app; that I wanted APPLE to cover my cost. They ended up crediting my account for 5-free song downloads, (Yes, it's a pathetic compensation, but, it’s something.. and it’s something that won’t hurt Sean, but DOES cost Apple money).

I spoke to Robert Barger @ Apple Corporate care. You can reach him at 512-674-2500 x 40267. Give him a call and let him know how you feel about what happened.
