In an on-stage interview at Carnegie Hall with Walt Mossberg, Sony CEO Howard Stringer appears to have confirmed an earlier rumor that an upcoming iPhone 5 will have an 8MP digital camera with a sensor made by Sony. Stringer made a number of somewhat cryptic comments to Mossberg about Apple, at one point commenting on the irony of Sony making "the best camera" for Apple devices.

As part of this same comment, he apparently also mentioned Sony's camera sensor factory in Sendai was shut down due to the earthquake, confirming a detail that we reported last week. 9to5mac.com, which was at the event, puts some of the pieces together and suggests that the factory shutdown might mean a delay for the iPhone 5.

Of course, predicting a launch delay for the iPhone 5 based on these remarks is a stretch, given that the only thing he really revealed was that a damaged Sony factory in Sendai is supposed to supply the company's "best" camera sensor to Apple. But given the other rumors to this effect, it seems a relatively modest stretch, though a stretch nonetheless.
