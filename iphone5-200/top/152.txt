Just half an hour after the iPhone 5 went up for pre-order, USB adaptors for Apple's new Lightning port sold out, forcing users with compatible accessories to wait until new shipments arrive in October.

Both versions of Apple's new Lightning to 30-pin adaptor are already quoted to ship in October, but the Lightning to USB adaptor saw shipments slip to two to three weeks within 30 minutes of Apple initiating iPhone 5 pre-orders on Friday. Currently, there are three adaptor models available in the U.S., a $39 version with a 0.2-meter cable and a $29 unit that resembles an oversized 30-pin plug and the regular Lightning to USB adaptor that runs for $19. Apple unveiled the smaller 9-pin Lightning connector alongside the iPhone 5 at a special event on Wednesday, with the new plug said to be a necessity in building thinner iDevices. The proprietary part is 80 percent smaller than the legacy 30-pin connector it replaces, is all-digital and can be plugged into compatible devices in any orientation. Besides the iPhone 5, the new iPod touch and iPod nano also use the newly introduced standard. The Lightning to USB adaptor may be available in brick-and-mortar Apple Stores, though the stock allotted to each location is not known.
