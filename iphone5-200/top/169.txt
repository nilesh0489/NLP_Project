Apple has just released the Iphone 5 and that bring to an end the most awaited tech launch of the year. It also marks the end of a long wait for people who wanted to wait , compare and buy their next smart phone.

Unlike the previous launches, Iphone has been launched in a very competitive environment. There are at lest 3 other phones in the market which  would be looked at before the customer decides to splurge on their phone fetish.

But the question is should I buy an Iphone 5?

7.6 mm in depth, weighing 112 grams, making it 18 per cent thinne

r and 20 per cent lighter than the iPhone 4S. Powered by Apple’s A6 chip, promising two times the processing and graphics performance of its predecessor

Complete redesign with 4-inch (diagnol) Retina display The taller screen delivers more content, an extra row of apps plus widescreen HD video, five days viewing on your calendar and more display space for web pages.

Improved audio and recording, including three microphones, bottom, front, and back and new noise canceling technology and new Apple EarPods, promising the kind of quality you’d expect in higher-end earphones.

LTE-enabled (Long Term Evolution) meaning it will work on the new faster cellular networks that have been rolled out by Canada’s carriers in Vancouver and other centres and are the latest new standard for cellular communication

A new ‘Lightning’ connector that is smaller and promises to be “smarter and more durable” than its predecessor (Apple will have a Lightning-to-30-pin adaptor so you can use the new iPhone 5 with your old stereo systems and other docking devices.)

IOS 6 will power the new device, with more than 200 new features it is going to be all new and better.
