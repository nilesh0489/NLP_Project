What's wrong with making the batteries bigger? The iphone, for instance, is already .37 inches wide. What's wrong with rounding up and making it .5 inches and fitting a bigger battery inside? Evo 4G has shitty battery life already, it's already as big as a brick, what is another .25 inches for the thickness? What about laptops these days. Even with dim use and most settings turned off, typing and listening to music won't get you more then 4-8 hours. All these manufacturers are saying "hey look, our gadget can go 7 hours without a charge" then it get's the consumer and those 7 hours are only with every possible setting turned off and lowest light settings as well. Why not make my laptop 1/2"-1" wider and fucking stuff a bigger battery inside? I don't give a fuck about how tiny your product is anymore. If the battery life sucks, FUCK YOU.
