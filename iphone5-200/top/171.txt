Apple has announced that the iPhone 5 has sold over five million units during its launch weekend.

In its first three days of availability, the iPhone 5 achieved record breaking sales of 5 million units. More than 100 million devices have been upgraded to iOS 6, Apple also announced.

Demand for iPhone 5 has been incredible and we are working hard to get an iPhone 5 into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. While we have sold out of our initial supply, stores continue to receive iPhone 5 shipments regularly and customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date. We appreciate everyoneâ€™s patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5s for everyone.
