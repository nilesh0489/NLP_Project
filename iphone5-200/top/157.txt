US television station Fox 5 New York has aired a report in which it claims the iPhone 5 comes equipped with a laser keyboard and holographic projector.

The claims appear in a news report, since posted to YouTube, in which reporter Lidia Curanaj meets fanbois queueing outside a New York Apple store.

That part of the segment goes predictably enough, but when Curanaj cuts to footage of the iPhone 5 in action the vision shows an iPhone beaming a keyboard onto a desk and projecting a moving image into thin air.

Those tricks seem to come from this fan video detailing a wish-list for the iPhone 5.

The gaffe, if it is one, was captured with a handheld video camera, so audio and video are both sub-optimal. The audio, in particular, changes tone a little when the footage kicks in, which could be accounted for by the change in location from on the street to in a studio.

But as the animated station logo doesn't miss a frame during that transition, this is either a genuine mistake or someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make Fox look bad. Judge for yourself in the video below. The laser bits start at 0:42 Â®
