Here’s a piece of visual evidence that the iPhone 5 could have a larger screen and a thinner bezel. Thanks to a Chinese reseller of Apple parts, this unconfirmed photo has surfaced, reportedly of the digitizer panel for the iPhone 5.

According to 9 to 5 Mac, the screen has similar construction to the same part on the iPhone 4, but as you can see, the panel reaches almost all the way out to the edges of the device. There’s more screen area on the top and bottom, also bolstering iPhone 5 rumors we’ve been hearing about a much larger screen.

From this picture, it’s hard to tell if that’s the rumored 4-inch screen or a 4.3-inch screen, matching many of the Android smartphones released recently.

Taking this rumor one step further, Piotrek has put together mockup of what the new iPhone 5 would look like if it were wearing this larger digitizer panel:
