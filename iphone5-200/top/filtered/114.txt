The ongoing patent war between Apple and Samsung has seen the two companies in court once again, as each one is asking for the other’s product to be banned from sale.

While Apple’s lawyers are arguing that the touch screen interface on the Samsung Galaxy Tab breaches the patent, Samsung are claiming that the iPad and iPhone are infringing on 3G patents and should be banned from sale.

Monday saw the two rival companies stand in courts in Australia and the Netherlands in an attempt to block the sale of one another’s products.

Apple lawyer Steve Burley argued that not only did the Samsung tablet resemble the iPad 2 in “form, factor and shape,” but it also infringed on specific patents regarding the unlocking, scrolling and zooming features.

Samsung’s counter-claims were with regards to the 3G mobile telecoms patents that it holds. Whilst they claimed that Apple failed to license patented designs used inside the iPhone and iPad, Apple argued that they should not need to do so.

In the past Apple has score more points in the ongoing patent wars, with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 being banned from sale in Germany, Samsung postponing its tablet launch plans in Australia, and Samsung’s smart phones being banned from sale in the Netherlands starting from the coming October.

Despite Samsung filing suits against Apple in France, South Korea and the United States amongst other countries, it has yet to achieve any significant success.

Patent blogger Florian Mueller said: “I believe an injunction is rather unlikely. Samsung may be entitled to a royalty payment, which requires some detailed technical analysis, but Apple will most likely continue to be able to sell.”
