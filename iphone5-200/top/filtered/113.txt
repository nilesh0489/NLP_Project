In an attempt to identify those who are simply passionate, blind or both, Jimmy Kimmel takes to the streets to show how desperate people are for the new, new thing.

Most people think it's thinner and lighter.

One person thinks it's far nicer than his own iPhone 4S.

These were just some of the reactions as Jimmy Kimmel's team took an iPhone 5 to the streets of Los Angeles to ask people what they thought.

What could possibly have been funny about this? Well, the phone they were being shown was the iPhone 4S.

Intellectuals will look at this footage and declare that these are the dangers of ration marketing.

People are so desperate for the new, new thing that they don't even realize they're being shown and old, old thing.

Yesterday's presentation of iPhone 5 left some feeling distinctly saddened that the new, new thing wasn't sufficiently different from the old, old thing.

Naturally, Apple's answer was that when people are in love, they don't really want change. They just say they do.

Perhaps these people, caught off guard by a camera, prove the point. They are so blindly in the thrall of Apple's sense of taste that they are more open to suggestion than all of Pavlov's puppies.

And yet, for myself, I see another aspect to this fascinating piece of film.

This is surely also a commentary on Angelenos.

Perhaps it is symbolic that these interviews took place outside Zara. Here's a brand that understands that it needs to shovel trends in very quickly, sell them out within a matter of hours on Wednesday, and then wait for the delivery truck to bring in some new trends by Friday.

At least Apple takes its time. It can, because none of its competitors has mastered the art of, well, art. And that's really quite funny.

Correction, 10:10 a.m. PT: An earlier version of this story misstated the location of the Kimmel show's interviews, which took place in Los Angeles.
