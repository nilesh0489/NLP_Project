Apple today sent members of the media invites to an event in San Francisco next week, where the company is expected to unveil the next version of the iPhone.

It's official -- Apple's holding an event next Wednesday, where the company is widely expected to debut its next iPhone.

Just like its iPad reveal earlier this year, Apple is holding at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater.

The invite says only "It's almost here," with a shadowed "5" underneath the September 12 date. The event will begin at 10 a.m. in San Francisco. CNET will cover the event with a live blog, so mark that time and head back here to tune in.

The date confirms a report from blog iMore in late July that Apple would hold its iPhone event on September 12. The other half of that report said the device would go on sale nine days later on Friday, September 21.

Among the changes expected to come to the next iPhone are a larger screen, as well as compatibility with fourth-generation cellular networks. Numerous components have leaked out over the past few months that hint at some of those features, from screen covers and near-finished cases, right down to the much-rumored smaller dock plug. It's nowhere close to the leak that was the iPhone 4 in 2010, but the design features have been far from a secret.

This announcement confirms one of two long-rumored events Apple reportedly plans to hold in the next two months. There's been talk for some time that it will also hold a separate event next month to debut a smaller version of the iPad, a device that's been rumored since the initial model debuted in 2010.

We'll have more information on that in the coming days. In the meantime, for a full list of rumors, and things to expect, be sure to check CNET's iPhone 5 rumor roundup, which we've kept lovingly updated.
