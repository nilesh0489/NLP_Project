We'd seen previously how Apple customer support handled complaints about a weird purple lens flare that shows up on certain iPhone 5 camera shots. But the problem's apparently become so widespread that the company has issued a general proclamation in its support pages.

Apple's explanation of the problem, and its recommended fix, are equally short and frustrating. While not highlighting iPhone 5 specifically, the company acknowledges that "A purplish or other colored flare, haze, or spot is imaged from out-of-scene bright light sources during still image or video capture" when using the smartphone's camera.

True enough! But how, pray tell, do we resolve this issue? Honestly, you shouldn't have been taking that picture in the first place, you big dummy:

Most small cameras, including those in every generation of iPhone, may exhibit some form of flare at the edge of the frame when capturing an image with out-of-scene light sources... Moving the camera slightly to change the position at which the bright light is entering the lens, or shielding the lens with your hand, should minimize or eliminate the effect.

While it may be true that these same results can happen with every generation of the iPhone, it sure hasn't to this degree. Which makes one wonder if that new sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera isn't at least partially to blame.

Either way, folks, there's your fix. The camera's just fine; you just need to be a better photographer. Helpful! [Apple via MacRumors]
