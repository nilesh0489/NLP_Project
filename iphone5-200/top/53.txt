AT&T (T) has started to appease customers annoyed by its FaceTime policies by announcing that iPhone 5 users will be able to use the video chat application over the carrier’s LTE network even if they don’t have a shared data plan. AT&T isn’t charging customers any extra money to use FaceTime over its LTE network and that company says that it “expects to roll out this functionality to customers over the next eight to ten weeks.” AT&T is still requiring that customers have tiered data plans to use FaceTime over cellular, however, so customers that still have grandfathered unlimited data plans won’t be able to take advantage.
