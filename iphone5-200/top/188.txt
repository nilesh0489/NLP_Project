If you're holding out on buying an iPhone until the new one is out, mark down Apple's just-announced September 12 event on your calendar: that could be the day the phone is revealed. Posted by The Loop, the invite says the event will begin at 10 AM PDT at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco.

If you wanna read into the teaser image Apple sent out, the shadow of the 12 is a 5, implying that they just might actually call the next iPhone the iPhone 5. If you haven't been keeping up, rumors have suggested the iPhone 5 will have a new two-tone unibody design, a smaller, redesigned dock connector, 4G LTE and a larger 4-inch display using Sharp's IGZO technology. There's also a possibility the phone could have NFC technology baked in, along with redesigned earbuds.

iPods are typically a hallmark of the September Apple even, and though they're not the relevant, must-have gadgets they used to be, it's always worth keeping an eye open for those. There are also rumors that Apple could trot out a smaller, 7.85-inch iPad mini as well, but there have been a wave of rumors suggesting that may not happen until October. And of course, there's the ever-mythical iTV that could magically appear anytime between now and never. Either way, next Wednesday should be pretty fun. [The Loop]
