Ok, ok, hate is a very strong word, but my iPhone has lost emails, twisted my words around with Autocorrect and turns off halfway through the day. If my iPhone was an assistant, I’d fire him!

I jumped on the iPhone bandwagon a month ago today when I turned my old RIM Blackberry in. I bought into the upgrade hype of how Blackberry is a dinosaur, and I’m missing out on the best thing since sliced bread. I caved to peer pressure. I heard “Give it a few weeks and you’ll LOVE it!” from 10 different people. Then, slowly, I’d get the confessions: “I know it’s not that great but the camera is amazing” or “I can’t live without the apps!”

Then I got to thinking – is my business built on Instagram and Angry Birds?

I wrote a column a ways back on “8 Tips To Increase Your Productivity.” Well, the iPhone was the single best way to decrease my productivity. With all those appointment at the Genius Bar, all that money spent on accessories to make it work as well as my Blackberry, my iPhone hasn’t saved me any time! Here are some solutions I’ve found to help save some minutes for every other iEntrepreneur.

I now spend more time rewriting emails than writing them. I have to re-read the entire email to make sure Autocorrect didn’t pull a fast one on me – like when it turned “just one sec” into “give one sex.” This is one of the tamer Autocorrect moments. With the wrong client this would be quite embarrassing! Also, selecting a section of text feels like finger painting – give me back my roller ball!

Quick Fix:My amazing assistant found me an iPhone case with a slide-out keyboard that works via Bluetooth. Keyboards may not look as sleek as a touchscreen, but they’re a must for Blackberry converts!
