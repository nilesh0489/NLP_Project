A new rumor reported by Digital Trends claims that Apple’s next iPhone will be a modest upgrade from the current model iPhone and “will be released in late July or early August” of 2011.

If you’re holding out for a radically redesigned “iPhone 5″ handset, this new report says that you’ll have to wait until “spring 2012.”

Citing an anonymous source who spoke to Japanese-language site Macotakara, Digital Trends writes that the next iPhone to land in the market will be called iPhone 4S and will feature a form factor similar to the iPhone 4, an ARM Cortex-A9 processor chip, an 8-megapixel camera and more.

“The report also said that Apple’s new phone will be SIM-less and contain an ‘additional 3-4 antennas inside,’ which would allow it to be used with both GSM and CDMA networks and thereby enabling a single model to run on both AT&T and Verizon networks,” notes Digital Trends.

Those hoping for a glimpse at the iPhone 4S–or even the iPhone 5–at next week’s WWDC event may want to rethink their expectations. Apple’s latest press release announced that the company will take the wraps off its new cloud-based music service, iCloud, and will also show off its Mac OS X Lion and iOS software.

Writes PCMag, “It’s likely Apple saw the speculation around the next version of the iPhone, which has traditionally been unveiled this time of year for a summer release, and decided to get ahead of those expectations lest anticipation for ‘iPhone 5′ overshadow the software and services it wants to highlight.”

Previous rumors from DigiTimes claimed that Apple would begin production of an “iPhone 4S” device in August and may launch it as early as September 2011.
