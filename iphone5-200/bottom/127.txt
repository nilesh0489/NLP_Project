Images of Apple’s next iPhone have surfaced online over the past few months. All still unconfirmed by Apple, but point towards a similar design to the iPhone 4/4S, but sport a larger display, be slightly thinner, have a more powerful processor, and possibly include a new locations for the antenna and the headphone jack.

There’s no word on how Apple will be packaging the “iPhone 5,” but a new video has popped up on a Vietnamese site that could show Apple has plans to resign their earbuds. According to a post on Tinhte, the earbuds will still be coming in their iconic white, but looking a bit more futuristic. They state that “In my hands are the new earphones for the iPhone 5 that is about to come out – Apple’s next generation of iPod [sic]. These will replace the current earphones that are on the market… They have the appearance of a horse’s head, not like earbuds. When they are worn, they have a much smaller profile. They have the appearance of a fully integrated, single unit – there’s no part that looks like it would come apart – not like earbuds; the integrated design is characteristic of Apple products… the new ones are clearly made in Vietnam. (Reading from the wires): “Designed by Apple in California, assembled in Vietnam.”

Apple is expect to announce the new iPhone on September 12th, then make it widely available on September 21st.
