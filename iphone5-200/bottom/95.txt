Apple's $1.05 billion patent verdict against Samsung made headlines worldwide in August, but the products at issue in that trial aren't the cutting edge of technology anymore. The two sides have claims and counter-claims stacked up against each other well beyond the blockbuster August trial. On Monday night, Samsung filed court papers to officially add Apple's newest iPhone to the list of gadgets it wants to kick off the market.

Samsung is claiming the iPhone 5 infringes eight of its patents: two patents that are part of cell phone standards, and six "feature" patents said to cover things like how smartphone displays change when music is being played.

The new claims were added to an existing lawsuit [PDF], originally filed by Apple in February 2012. This case, filed in the same San Jose federal court that heard the August trial, includes both sides' patent claims over newer smartphone and tablet products, like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S III. Discovery is scheduled to stretch through 2013, and the lawsuit is currently scheduled for trial in 2014.

Accusing the iPhone 5 is a no-brainer for Samsung; the company has to accuse Apple's most valuable products to have any legal leverage against the Cupertino giant, especially now that it is on the defensive after a massive trial loss. The company told Apple it would be accusing the product on September 18, three days before it was even able to get a physical phone to analyze it.
