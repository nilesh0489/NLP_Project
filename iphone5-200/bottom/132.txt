While we're not expecting the iPhone 5 to debut at next week's WWDC, we're clearly getting close enough to a release that the rumors are jumping out left, right, and center. Here, video hands-on with that taller, two-tone, unibody goodness that we'd seen pictures of just last week.

And you know what? It's growing on me.

There's not much new in the video Apple parts reseller ETradeSupply posted that we couldn't glean from the previous leak; a smaller dock connector, a headphone jack on the bottom (no!), and a distinctive unibody back plate/antenna. The width is approximately the same as iPhone 4S, but the added height leaves plenty of room for a four-inch, 16:9 display.

The other curiosity here is the significantly smaller SIM card slot, which could either mean that a redesigned nano-SIM is even closer than we thought, or that Apple's mixing up its SIM card tray design. Neither of which is worth getting particularly worked up about at this point.

If Apple follows its usual release patterns—and it almost never strays from them—we're not going to see an actual iPhone 5 announcement until October. Will it look like this? Maybe. Or maybe this is just a design that's being explored and will be tossed by then. Or maybe some merry prankster is seeding parts suppliers with iPhone MacGuffins.

But Apple rumors can also be like anything else; if there's enough smoke, there's probably a fire somewhere. And in this case, with a steady stream of leaks all pointing to the same design, there's likely to be at least a few embers' worth of truth to it. [CydiaBlog via 9to5Mac]
