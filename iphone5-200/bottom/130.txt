Samsung may have lost the patent battle against Apple, but that doesn’t mean the Korean electronics giant has quieted down.

In a new ad shown to Mashable that will start running in various national and regional papers on Sunday, Samsung has stacked the specs of its Galaxy S III smartphone against the newly-announced iPhone 5.

What’s first noticeable about the ad is its tagline, which is an obvious jab at Apple: “It doesn’t take a genius.” Not only does this reference Apple’s “genius” retail employees, Samsung also implies that deciding between the two devices is a piece of cake.

The Galaxy S III’s list of features is much longer than the iPhone 5, and its specs beat Apple’s latest smartphone in terms of HD resolution, talk time and RAM. It also features near-field communications (NFC) technology — not included in the iPhone 5 — which allows users to pay at checkout with a mobile phone.

The ad also pokes fun at the iPhone 5's specs wording, dismissing Apple’s new Lightning dock as “a totally different plug.”
