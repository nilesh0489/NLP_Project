Apple has invited journalists (including Wired.co.uk) to a "special event" on 12 September, putting an end to any doubt that the iPhone 5 is about to be launched.

The invitation, sent out on 4 September and can be seen in this story, invites London media to an event in the capital, which mirrors a US event taking place Stateside. Traditionally, when Apple hosts UK and US events on the same day, it's because it's going to be a major launch with imminent UK availability.

The iPhone 5 has been seen in many leaks. The device shown off by Apple on 12 September is expected to have a much larger screen than the current model, a thinner design, higher-resolution display, a quad-core processor and will run iOS 6.

Although no official launch date has been announced, sources that described the 12 September event date ahead of its formal announcement also slated late-September as the on-sale date for whatever Apple unveils.

Additionally, the rumoured "iPad mini" -- a seven-inch version of Apple's tablet -- is thought to be just around the corner, although sources suggest this will be unveiled in October, not September.
