Apple's solution is to adjust the composition of the camera.

Apple as responded to complaints of purple lens flare when taking photographs with the new iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 launched just a couple of weeks ago but users taking photos with the onboard camera have complained of a purplish hue to their photos in certain circumstances. Apple this past weekend addressed the issue via its official support pages.

The Cupertino-based company explained that the issue is present in every generation of the iPhone and indeed most small cameras. According to Apple, these smaller cameras may exhibit 'some form of flare' at the edge of the frame when capturing an image with out-of-scene light sources.

"This can happen when a light source is positioned at an angle (usually just outside the field of view) so that it causes a reflection off the surfaces inside the camera module and onto the camera sensor," Apple explained.

So, we know what the problem is, but how do you go about fixing it? According to Apple, you should just take the photo a little bit differently.

"Moving the camera slightly to change the position at which the bright light is entering the lens, or shielding the lens with your hand, should minimize or eliminate the effect," the company advised.
