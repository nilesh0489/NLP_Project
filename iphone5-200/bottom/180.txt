Somewhere, maybe even right now, someone is already using the iPhone 5. At least that's what this screenshot would have you believe.

TechCrunch says an anonymus developer noticed an "iPhone 5,2" device pop up on their server logs, which means the next Apple handset is being tested as we speak. Which makes sense, as it's almost certainly launching next month.

And no, the "iPhone 5,2" thing doesn't mean it's going to be called the iPhone 5. It's not. That's just how Apple names things internallyâ€”the iPhone 4 was iPhone 3,1. [TechCrunch]
