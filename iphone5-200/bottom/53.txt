Apple is widely expected to take the wraps of its latest creation, the iPhone 5, today at an invite-only press event at 10AM Pacific (1PM Eastern). Since there won't be a video feed of the announcement, we'll be reporting live from inside San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Join our live blog below, starting at 9:30AM PDT/12:30PM EDT to get the news as it unfolds. Until then, take a look at our iPhone 5 coverage so far, after the jump.
