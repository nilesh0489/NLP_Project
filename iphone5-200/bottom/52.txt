There are also times when there is an embarrassing moment ever happened. Unfortunately, it was Bostinno.com has faced this kind of embarrassment for the moment. The beauty queen and full of BostInno completely naive to reach such a thing. Allegedly mistaken for flash memory chip (hardware) for Adobe Flash, and this story came with the iPhone 5 and provide support for Adobe Flash. Of course, we love the support of Adobe Flash, and how we would like to point BostInno would have been true, but it’s true, but it was just a “misunderstanding.”

The news that Apple has exceeded the actual chip on the Israel-based manufacturer of flash, Anobit. But without BostInno come take a look at this issue, with a great story that Apple’s iPhone will support Flash 5. BostInno probably thought he was the first to break such news, but it seems that everything wants to do is to spread rumors about the iPhone 5.

They do not stop there. They went to say that the cause of the iPhone since version 5 was due to Apple trying to adapt to a “chip” private or controller to accelerate performance of Flash. Again, it is not totally unfounded. Apple has won the only true story is that the iPhone 5-makers, Anobit for $ 400 – $ 500 million.
