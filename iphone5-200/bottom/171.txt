While I appreciate the mobility and convenience of a cell phone, when I'm working (at a desk, especially), I prefer a desk phone. However, for simplicity's sake, I'd like to just pair my cell phone.

Will something like this phone pair via Bluetooth to my phone?

It looks like this Native Union phone would work with iPhone, but I just have a regular cell phone, not an iPhone (or smartphone).
