Apple's next iPhone 5 will dump Infineon but for Qualcomm Chipsets and the following Apple Wireless Products will use Qualcomm's chipset's dumping Infineon's chipset's as well.

At the end of last month, Intel merged the German chipmaker Infineon¡¯s wireless wing (WLS), who provides baseband chips for the iPad 3G and all iPhone models(Verify iPhone Driver) since 2007. However, Apple's next iPhone 5 will dump Infineon but for Qualcomm Chipsets.

There was rumored that the fist CDMA iPhone would use Qualcomm's chipset instead of Infineon's. Then the iPhone 5 will also use Qualcomm's chipsets. That's is to say the following Apple Wireless Products(click to download Apple iPhone/iPod iOS 4 Firmware driver) will use Qualcomm's chipset's dumping Infineon's chipset's.

Infineon's WLS, meanwhile, doesn't currently make chips for iPhone 5, meaning Intel could be left out in the cold, Apple-less. As Qualcomm pioneered CDMA technology, and owns a 69% share of the CDMA mobile phone chipset market making it a solid choice for a picky buyer like Apple who may be thinking of abandoning exclusivity and expanding to other networks.

iPhone 5 dumps Infineon but for Qualcomm would diversify Cupertino's supplier base and reduce dependency on a single supplier.
