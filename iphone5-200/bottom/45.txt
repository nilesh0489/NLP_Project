Seriously apple. Your market does not want shiny new specs, they want something that looks fucking stylish, sexy, and different. People won't buy the god damn iPhone 4s because it looks identical to the iPhone 4. People looking to enter the Apple scene will buy it cause it's new but people will not kill each other over this product.

People could care less about the specs but if you slapped the same iPhone 4 with a new look, bigger screen, some useless features, and the number 5 you would literally sell that thing like hotcakes.

They do not want a better spec phone, they want a stylish phone. Apple is a fashion symbol, if it functions well and looks sexy as hell, they'll buy it.
