A job posting for iPhone sales specialists on employment website Reed could indicate that the iPhone 5 will be released in mid-August.

The post, which was sent to us by a tipster, asks for "full-time iPhone Sales Staff for an exciting project to work 5 days a week (Tuesday-Saturday) for the period 16th August - 29th October within key retail stores". The posting appears several times on Reed, with each post covering a different area of the UK.

It sounds as if Apple is looking to bolster its sales staff, and the only reason we can think is that there's a big product launch on the horizon.

Apple is notoriously secretive when it comes to product launches, but seemingly has hired recruitment agency Gekko Ltd to find a bunch of aspiring Geniuses on its behalf.

The awards page on Gekko's website indicates that it has worked with Apple in the past on shops within shops -- the specific Apple-branded sections within larger outlets. We'd wager that Gekko is hiring to fill these sections, as one of the responsibilities of the advertised role is to "ensure the Apple area within the store is effectively merchandised".

Other responsibilities include completing daily reports, providing a "first-class customer service experience" and to "capture the hearts and minds of potential customers". Successful applicants will also be required to attend a four-day training event in London. If you're keen on applying, the job pays a very respectable £75 per day.

We've been hearing that the iPhone 5 would be appearing in September, but this could mean Apple is planning to surprise us with an August launch.
