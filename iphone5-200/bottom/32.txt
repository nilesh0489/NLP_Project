Basically, it goes as follows.

1) Newspapers as well as other media outlets are looking to make money online.

2) Apple introduces the iPad, which presents these media in new and exciting ways (Seriously, all the iPad hate aside, think about how you would've envisioned the future of mobile computing, say, 20 years ago. Probably something like the iPad: a Device that contains all your books, movies, music, and maps with an extremely simple interface).

3) In this new ecosystem, there are no preconceptions of everything being free like there is on the internet, so publications like the NYT can start making money again.

4) Another issue with the regular internet is that even if you put your stuff behind a paywall, some blog can just post "So and so reports that such and such happened" and there goes your exclusive. Well somebody could just do that on the iPad, right? All they'd have to do is submit it to the App Store, and... oh.

5) The same is true to a lesser extent for the iPhone. Again, people are used to paying for Apps, creating a market where before free content used to dominate.

6) It also applies to music and movies: computer-savvy people will probably still torrent things, but most people prefer Apple's simplicity.

tl;dr Apple created the only feasible online economy by getting people to pay for what was once free.
