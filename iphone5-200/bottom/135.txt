We're just a few hours away from Apple's event, but it looks like iPhone 5 will be the name of the company's new flagship phone. 9to5Mac discovered that a search on Apple.com clearly reveals PR and product pages for the iPhone 5, though the links themselves are still dead. While it's not exactly surprising to see the iPhone 5 name after Apple tipped it on its event announcement last week, it's still a bit of a shock to see a company that's so focused on secrecy let these details leak out ahead of time.

Additionally, search results also reveal a press release for a new iPod touch and iPod nano, though again there aren't any details on what specifically will be changed in these devices. We'll find out for sure what has changed in just a few hours — follow along with our live blog right here for all the news.

Update: Apple's search results have also tipped the forthcoming release of iTunes 11.

Update 2: The leaks keep on coming — search results now show LTE connectivity as a feature of the iPhone 5.
