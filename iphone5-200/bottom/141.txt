Today in San Francisco, Apple introduced a new, completely redesigned iPod touch. In addition to its new 4-inch, 16:9 Retina display, the 2012 model measures at just 6.1mm thin and trades the tapered chrome backing of last year's model for a flat aluminum panel. It weighs just 88 grams (3.1 ounces), down from the 101 grams (3.5 ounces) of the previous iteration. The front-facing camera has been improved and now supports 720p video and facial recognition, though the exact megapixel specification has yet to be revealed. On the back, Apple has dropped a new 5-megapixel camera with LED flash that supports 1080p video capture. Under the hood, Apple has swapped the A4 processor for the dual-core A5, which is less powerful than the new iPad's A5X and iPhone 5's A6 chips. What's most immediately recognizable, however, is the array of new colors it is is offered in, such as blue, pink, silver, and others. Check out our hands-on video and pictures below.
