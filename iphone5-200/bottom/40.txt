My AT&T Bill is consistently over $225 per month. We have 3 phones, a first gen iphone, a 3GS, and a "free" LG phone. I am on the plan for $89.99 per month for 1400 minutes. The fees break down like this:

89.99 first line 9.99.second line 9.99 third line 20 data for old iphone 30 data for new iphone 30 unlimited family text (we are avid texters) 5 international thing on my phone (reduces call rates for overseas calls, 1 call per month justifies the expense)

So, right there is 195, and I think the rest is made up of taxes and random fees.

Anyone have any ideas on how to reduce the cost?

I am almost considering just quitting paying, and signing up with T-mobile, and taking the hit on my credit. In another 22 months (the remaining term) I'll have spent over 4000 on cell phones, which I find highly ridiculous.

I'm afraid to reduce the minutes, as we've gone into the rollover minutes several times, and I think this is the lowest plan that allows them. I tried going with less text messages, but they have some crazy method of charging for MMS texts that my kid has figured out how to send. A single sound clip he sent to a friend for instance was $12 one month.

Any experiences or insights are welcome.
