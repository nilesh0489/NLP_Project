Apple's spec page for the iPhone 5 has been posted, revealing that the phone will come in three different radio configurations, each offered in three different storage capacities - 16, 32, and 64 GB - for a total of nine variants. One model will be exclusive to AT&T, supporting 4G LTE in their 700 and 1700 bands. The model for Verizon and Sprint will support CDMA and both carriers' 4G LTE bands, plus three other LTE bands used overseas. The CDMA model will also support EVDO Rev. B. A third model will support European and Asian LTE bands. This global version is similar to the Sprint/Verizon version, but with US-specific modes disabled. All three versions will support quad-band GSM and quad-band WCDMA/HSPA+ (850/900/1900/2100). None of the versions will support T-Mobile's USA's HSPA+ network in the 1700 (AWS) band. Nor will any version support band 12, the lower-700 MHz band used by regional carriers such as U.S. Cellular for 4G LTE service.
