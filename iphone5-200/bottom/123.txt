Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer may have unintentionally given away plans for an eight-megapixel camera in the iPhone 5. During an interview with the WSJ's Walt Mossberg, he claimed that the company's camera sensor plant in Sendai had seen hit by the Japanese earthquake and that shipments of sensors to Apple would be delayed. Apple has so far only sourced cameras from OmniVision, suggesting that Sony was shipping for a future model.

The same February rumor attaching an eight-megapixel sensor to the iPhone 5 had Sony taking over from OmniVision after possible chip yield issues prevented the sensor from arriving on time. Sony's current eight-megapixel sensor from phones like the Xperia Neo may be an ideal fit as it has a CMOS sensor suited to low light with little noise. Apple has often insisted on overall quality over megapixel count and would get its needs met while still seeing a sensor upgrade. A delay may help talk of the iPhone 5 missing WWDC. Although most have blamed the delay on iOS 5, it may also help Sony get enough sensors to Apple to accommodate demand. [via 9to5]
