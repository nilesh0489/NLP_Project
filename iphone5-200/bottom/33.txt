These other companies you've named haven't had frequent stories about their assembly lines. Worker mass suicides, anti suicide contracts forced upon their employees, etc. Quit trying to make up some moral equivalency bulls***. If we heard an equivalent amount of stories on Motorola's assembly lines, or HTC's assembly lines I'd label you something other than an Apple Apologist. But in the mean time "Apple is reaping a mind-blowing 93% margin on iPhone 5 memory." Read the story on Phone Arena. Just because all phone companies hire subcontractors to make phones does not make all manufacturers demands equivalent. Especially when a company is so hugely profitable that they don't need to demand such work from their employees to stay in the black. If an ailing manufacturer hired a sub and said "We need these phones to be churned out in X time or our company will not turn a profit..." I can see asking your workers to work through a holiday because if they don't there will be no work for them later on because the company will fail. However if you're the most profitable company in the world you have room in your profit margins to be selective about your subcontractors and find one that treats their employees fairly to not kill you in the media over mistreatment violations, or at least negotiate a contract with them that they get paid enough to treat their employees fairly. If you want Quality AND Speed you have to pay a premium.Â You cant have Quality, Speed, and pay nothing at the same time. Your whole mentality about rationalizing why it's okay is just plain nieve, I hate sounding like a hippy because I hate hippies. But at this point I need to sound like a grown up. I understand that I won't get through to you, because your eyes are closed to the Chinese workers plight. But at least maybe I can turn around some brainwashing you might trick the other Phone Arena kids into thinking.
