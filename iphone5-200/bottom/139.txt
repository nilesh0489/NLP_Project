Dock lovers, get ready to be disappointed. Apple Senior VP of Marketing Phil Schiller has reportedly said that the company has no plans to release a standalone dock for the upcoming iPhone 5, making it the first of its kind without such an accessory from Apple.

We learned about this after Schiller apparently responded to an e-mail from a concerned iPhone buyer. (Apple executives occasionally respond to e-mails from "the people," though not every e-mail gets a response.) Published at 9to5Mac, the original message asked Schiller about the noticeable absence of an iPhone 5 dock and wanted to know if one was in the works. Schiller appears to have responded (in part): "We do not plan on making a dock for the iPhone 5. Most people who use docks use them with speaker or clock systems."

I, myself, am a dock fanâ€”I've always liked having a dock plugged into my computer so I can drop my iPhone into it easily when I sit down in the morning. But since the release of the iPhone 4 in 2010, and my apparent inability to keep my iPhone from flying through the air onto the floor anywhere I go, I've resigned myself to using a case to protect my glass from shattering. (I've shattered both the front and back at this point.)

Because cases and docks don't mix, I've given up on docks, and I suspect many other iPhone users have done the same. Still, I'm disappointed in Apple's decision to not offer a dock for the iPhone 5, but this might open up an opportunity for third parties to fill the gap.
