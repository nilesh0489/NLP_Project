I was expecting a tablet Mac computer, not an oversized iPhone.

No Flash? Are you freaking kidding me? Why would I pay $400+ dollars for a web device that doesn't play flash when I can get a $250 netbook that does so? Even the Wii web browser has flash. WTF!

No USB ports? I have to pay $30 for a USB adapter? That is a big fucking tablet PC for gods sake! Not some pocket iPhone. For a computing device of that size, USB should be mandatory. What the fuck kind of shit is that? So now, I have to buy a $30 dollar adapter just to plug in a $5 thumb drive? Fuck you Apple!

$70 for a keyboard? Obviously, Apple doesn't have a high opinion of its userbase. Obviously, Apple thinks that we are retarded.

And Apple has to fucking nerve to talk badly about Netbooks? I would pick a Netbook any day of the week over an iPad. Seriously, Apple must be smoking crack to come out with bullshit like that.
