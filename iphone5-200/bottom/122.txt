Turns out politicians aren't the only ones putting out attack ads this time of year.

Days after Samsung debuted its latest fanboy-mocking advertisement, Nokia has joined the fray by releasing a new animated television commercial contrasting the iPhone 5 with its forthcoming Lumia 920. The ad, posted to Nokia's YouTube account, slams the iPhone for being boring and assails Apple for offering only two colors (black and white) on its new iPhone. (The Lumia 920 comes in bright yellow, red , gray, white and black.)

The "boring" thread is an attack, one imagines, not just on color options, but on the homogeneity Nokia wants the viewer to associate with buying and owning an iPhone. Nokia hit the same note in one of its Smartphone Beta Test ads from earlier this year, you might remember.

You can watch Nokia's -- ahem -- colorful ad below:

Nokia has yet to divulge pricing information or a release date for its Lumia 920, though the Finnish manufacturer has said it will be available by the end of 2012. That will put the Lumia 920 -- which most view as the flagship device for Microsoft's flagging Windows Phone operating system -- into direct competition with the iPhone 5, which is still in short supply nearly a week after its initial release.

The Lumia 920 will also be going up against new phones from Samsung (the Galaxy Note II) and Motorola (the Razr Maxx HD); though Nokia is, at least for now, focusing on Apple's market-leading smartphone.

If you want to see how the Lumia 920 compares against the iPhone 5 (aside from color availability and what it says about you as a person), CNET has a good comparison of the specs of each phone. And if you want to see how the much-vaunted Lumia 920's camera stacks up against the equally-vaunted iPhone 5's, our friends at Engadget recently ran a few tests, which you van view here.
