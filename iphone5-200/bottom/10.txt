Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 5 launches on Friday but we have been sent photos of the world’s first iPhone 5 unboxing. Apple has changed its packaging slightly with the iPhone 5, and as it announced last week, the company’s new EarPod headphones are bundled with the iPhone including a plastic travel case. Also included is a new power adapter that supplies more power to the phone when charging, and of course the Lightning to USB cable. Apple’s iPhone 5 goes on sale this Friday at 8:00 a.m. local time and in the meantime, be sure to check out a couple additional unboxing photos in the gallery below. Thanks to JDazzle for the photos!
