The Verge has learned that Google's Android event scheduled for Monday in New York Cityhas been canceled due to Hurricane Sandy. On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in response to the incoming storm, and Google's event was set to take place on a waterfront pier, which is now in an evacuation zone. Monday won't be a total loss, though: we'll be in San Francisco to cover Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 launch,which should be able to evade Sandy's wrath. It's the second time Google has postponed a launch event in recent memory â€” last year it moved its Ice Cream Sandwich event after the death of Steve Jobs. We'll keep you updated on Google's plans to reschedule, but in the meantime, grab your jackets and head somewhere dry.

Update: Google provided the following statement about the event tomorrow:

We are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more.
