One year ago, EFF rang alarm bells about SOPA and PIPA — Internet censorship bills threatening online freedom and the very structure of the Internet. Not long after, our members and the Internet community stood up to misguided politicians and deep-pocketed lobbyists and won, sinking SOPA and PIPA forever. It was revolutionary.

You have the power to shape this world, and EFF stands with you. For 22 years, donating members have enabled EFF to bring legal and technological expertise into crucial battles about online rights, from defending free speech online to challenging unconstitutional surveillance.
