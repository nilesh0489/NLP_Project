 Post-WWDC Keynote, it’s obvious these are not pictures of the (slightly disappointing) 3G iPhone. What can we say? It seemed like a good idea at the time. And Matt was drunk.

It wasn’t long ago that my inbox was full of screen caps from an image editing program of a new iPod, it was a fat yet small iPod that we now know as the 3rd gen Nano. We posted the photos and were later told by Apple’s legal team to take them down.

A similar tipster tonight has very generously given us these pics of the iPhone 2, or iPhone 3G as some are calling it. Like the Fat Nano from last summer, the images come from Apple or AT&T promotional material that shows not just the new iPhone, but also gives away a couple secrets.

It’s thinner than the current model, for sure, with a more MacBook Air-like bezeling. It’s got stereo speakers on the back and what appears to be the same screen as the current generation. But the real news here isn’t the Exchange support, but the front facing camera for iChat AV.

Oh yes, it’s there. Not only is the new iPhone smaller and more capable, but it also comes in red as part of the Product (Red) campaign, like many iPods do.

Buy a 3G, video-chatting iPhone and fight AIDS. We like it. Hit the jump for the rest of the pics.


[UPDATE] After some painstaking image manipulation, the text of the iChat blurb reads as below:

Video just became a little more fun. Start a real time video chat with other AT&T subscribers via 3G networking, or with iChat buddies via WiFi. The video calling revolution has begun.

So you can do video chat with your iChat buddies, but only via WiFi. Otherwise it’s phone to phone. Interesting.

[UPDATE] 2 See that part about about Windows XP or Vista being needed? Many people are saying it’s proof these are fake. No, we think Apple’s launching iChat for Windows, just like they did Safari. You heard us.
