Apple, never one to tolerate much controversial content in its precious app store, has joined the long list of companies cutting ties with WikiLeaks. An application that offered iPhone users access to WikiLeaks’ daily trickle of formerly-secret diplomatic cables has been removed from the app store with little explanation, as TechCrunch first reported.

Igor Barinov, the developer of the app, confirmed to TechCrunch that his $1.99 program had been pulled from the store, though whether that banishment was due to WikiLeaks’ political controversy or some other element of the app still isn’t clear. I’ve contacted the company for comment and will update if I hear back from them.

Update: Trudy Muller, an Apple spokesperson, says that Apple  “removed the Wikileaks App from the App Store because it violated our developer guidelines. Apps must comply with all local laws and may not put an individual or targeted group in harms way.”

You can still see a cached version of the banned app here.

Android, meanwhile, continues to allow half a dozen apps that offer access to WikiLeaks’ content, some for free. I’ve written to Google to ask whether it plans to take any action to block those apps. If it does, it can expect a serious backlash from users who expect a more liberal approach to their content and will no doubt cry foul over any censorship.

It’s no surprise that Apple, with its restrictive policies on content, wouldn’t tolerate the hosting of content that the U.S. government has declared stolen goods. Amazon Web Services, a far more tolerant platform, exiled WikiLeaks from its data centers two weeks ago, and financial firms have moved to choke the company too, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and most recently, Bank of America.

The ability to scroll on your phone through thousands of raw cables written in stuffy diplomatic language is hardly a privilege most users will miss–after all, they can still access the Guardian and the New York Times apps, where the same information is being parsed and delivered in a much more consumable form. But WikiLeaks will serve as a free speech litmus test for every company in its orbit. And it’s already shown just how little the likes of Apple and Amazon care about users’ access to information.
