AT&T will begin revoking unlimited data plans from customers who jailbreak their iPhones to use unauthorized tethering services, the company confirmed to Boy Genius Report today.

AT&T’s action applies to all customers tethering on the sly, whose monthly bills will automatically have AT&T’s 4GB tethering-approved plan added to them if they continue to tether past a certain date.
