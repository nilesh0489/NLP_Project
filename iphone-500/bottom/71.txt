According to research carried out by app store analytics company Distimo, the majority of sales taking place in the App Store are for games, while Android users are buying more tools and applications.

Studying the top 15 paid applications  for the iPhone, the report found nine of them were games, while not even one game made the top 15 on the Android chart. To balance that, not one productivity or utilities app appeared in Apple’s top 15.

This pattern continues for free games as well. One important point from the report is Classic games on Android Market are more popular than in the Apple App Store, with even 3 out of the 15 most popular games for Android being emulators. These types of emulators are not allowed in the Apple App Store.
