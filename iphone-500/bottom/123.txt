The Zoomback team has come out with a small gps gadget that you can place on anything and track it through your iPhone.  All you have to do is to get hold of the Zoomback device as you can see in the picture below and keep it in the backpack of your children or attach to your suitcase and download and install the iPhone app on your iPhone. Start the iPhone app and use your online username and password to log in and click on “Find Now” to track your items.

If you want to keep a continuous track of your items, switch to continuous mode and you will be able to track the movement of anything that you want to track at an interval of five minutes.

While Zoombak modules retail for $99 to $149 (USD) each, but I managed to find many modules for as little as $38 over at Amazon, which is a steal. You can grab the iPhone app here.
