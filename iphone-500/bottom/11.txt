We’ve put together a list of over 30 applications for jailbroken iPhones and the iPod Touch that let you connect with friends, play games, stream media, and more.

The iPhone and iPod Touch are great gadgets, but there are a lot of ways to make them better. Luckily there is a large application community out there that agrees, and they are turning out a seemingly endless supply of new apps that keep extending the usefulness of these devices.

Mind you, you do need to “jailbreak” your gadgets to make these work, and we didn’t tell you to do it :)
