SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19 (UPI) --Some iPhone owners have begun reporting a bug that has their handsets showing the wrong date and time, a U.S. tech website reports.

The majority of complaints appear to be coming from Verizon iPhone subscribers, Tom's Hardware Guide reported Friday.

Some iPhone owners are complaining about the date and time being off by a day, while others report dates off by as much as two weeks.

"Mine isn't just off by 30 min," one iPhone owner wrote on the Apple Support Communities website. "Today the black one was off by 15 days plus 6 hours and 12 minutes when I pulled it off the charger. The white one is my wife's and she complained yesterday evening that she had to fix the time four times throughout the day."

"I've had the phone for about two weeks and have noticed the time drifting slowly off by 3-5 minutes," another user wrote. "Tonight [Tuesday] at 10:40 p.m. it changed itself to September 28th 4:35pm."

Many of the complaining owners say the issue is occurring at their home, suggesting inconsistent WiFi or LTE coverage.

Several purported fixes have been suggested by users, including changing the date and time updating from automatic to manual, turning off LTE, resetting the device or toggling the Airplane mode.
