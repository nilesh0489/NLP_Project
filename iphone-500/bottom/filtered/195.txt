Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile Architecture

Apple’s iPhone 4 hasn’t even hit its one-month anniversary yet, but the company has already issued a software update that might fix the death grip problem affecting the device’s antenna.

However, despite the fact that iOS 4.1 was made available to developers late yesterday, the Cupertino outfit is keeping quiet until Friday, when it will hold a press conference about the iPhone 4.

The update itself has reportedly magnified the phone’s signal bars by making them taller. Whether this actually resolves what many have described as purely a hardware problem remains to be seen.



Two weeks ago Apple coughed to a glitch with the way the signal bars are displayed on various iterations of its iPhone that can lead to dramatic drops in reception and bandwidth.

The company said it was gobsmacked to have discovered the software flaw, and confirmed it would issue an update within a few weeks.

Apparently, by lengthening the signal bars this almighty glitch ought to vanish, but perhaps iPhone 4 owners should sprinkle a little bit of angel dust on the slinky beast too, just for good measure.

Meanwhile, until tomorrow (maybe) iPhone punters will be none the wiser about whether iOS 4.1 has saved the device from the evil death grip. That’s because developers sign a non-disclosure agreement with Apple that means details about what’s baked into the update will remain out of the public domain.

So, iPhone 4 users, have your signal bars sprouted? Tell us all about it in comments. ®
