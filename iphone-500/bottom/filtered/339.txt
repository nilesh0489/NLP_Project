I sent out an email to Apple asking if 3.3.1 meant that middleware such has Unity would not be allowed and I got this: "Thank you for contacting the Apple Developer Support regarding the iPhone Developer Program. Please know that we are unable to provide interpretation of the terms and conditions outlined in the License Agreement. You may wish to contact your legal counsel in order to clarify the terms. I hope that this information is useful to you. Please let me know if you have any questions." Talk about a canned answer...
