The new iPhone 4 uses Apple's FaceTime video calling application to allow users to see each while on the phone. The resolution and streaming seems to be top notch, and using Face Time doesn't count as billable minutes. But STILL, somehow, there are some drawbacks.Face Time uses Wi-Fi so you have to be connected to a network in order to use it.Also Face Time only works from one iPhone 4 to another. Users that want video calling with non-iPhone 4 users will be forced to either find other applications or buy all their friends new iPhones.(Negative)BONUS: Even if you COULD get onto this easily and anywhere you want, if you weren't near a charger your conversation probably wouldn't last very long anyway, as apparently the battery on the iPhone 4, even though it's supposedly more powerful by about 40%, really isn't that much better than the one on the 3GS.FaceTime IS great technology, though, and really where phones have been moving towards for the last few years. There's nothing like actually SEEING the people you're speaking for a whole 13 minutes before your battery gives out in the middle of the day.
