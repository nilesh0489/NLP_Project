Apple announced an iPhone event today where they'll be giving "a sneak peek at the iPhone OS 3.0 software."

Gizmodo suggests this might coincide with the unveiling of a rumored touchscreen tablet based on the iPhone, but we'll see for sure on March 17th. Got a feature you'd love to see added to iPhone 3.0 (*cough, copy and paste, cough*)? Let's hear about it in the comments. [Gizmodo]
