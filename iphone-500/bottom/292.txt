AT&T plans to soon begin unlocking off-contract iPhones for customers with accounts in good standing who request that their devices be unlocked. Unlocking a handset allows the device to operate on any GSM network rather than just the network for which it was purchased, and AT&T does not currently provide customers customers with unlock codes for Apple’s iPhone. Engadget reported on Friday that the carrier was planning to amend its policy beginning this Sunday, and BGR was able to confirm the news with an AT&T spokesperson. ”Beginning Sunday, April 8, we will offer qualifying customers the ability to unlock their AT&T iPhones,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “The only requirements are that a customer’s account must be in good standing, their device cannot be associated with a current and active term commitment on an AT&T customer account, and they need to have fulfilled their contract term, upgraded under one of our upgrade policies or paid an early termination fee.”
