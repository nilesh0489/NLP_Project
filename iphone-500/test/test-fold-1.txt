A Microsoft executive on Wednesday took a dig at Apple and his own company, quipping that the new iPhone 4 might be as problematic for Cupertino as Vista was for Microsoft."It looks like that iPhone 4 might be their Vista, and I'm OK with that," Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner said during a keynote speech at the company's Worldwide Partner Conference, a video of which was posted online. "That's another mantle [Apple is] welcome to take. I actually read that headline last week and I just sort of had to smile after I did cartwheels, again."Vista is of course, the previous version of Microsoft's Windows operating system before Windows 7, which was plagued by bugs and generally viewed as a poor upgrade from XP.Turner made his comments while talking about Microsoft's efforts in the mobile space, and the company's upcoming launch of Windows Phone 7."One of the things that I want to make sure you know today is that you're going to be able to use a Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you're holding it to make a phone call," Turner said, referring to the iPhone 4 "death grip" issues.Turner acknowledged, however, that mobile has been a challenge for Microsoft. His speech comes just one week after the company killed its line of Kin social phones."This has been tough," Turner said about mobile.With the expected launch of Windows Phone 7 in late 2010, however, "we're back in the game," he said."When you look at this phone ? it's not like any phone you've ever seen from Microsoft, and I think that's a good thing," Turner continued. "We're re-booting ourselves in this area."Turner also discussed Apple's iPad. The tablet, he said, is "fabulous at content consumption, [but] lousy at content creation."As a result, most people are not going to dump their laptops in favor of an iPad at this point."They're generally a third device for most people. That's a fact and that's not going to change," Turner said. "Productivity matters and you can't maximize productivity if all you're doing is consuming content."

As the end of the epic soap opera that is the Apple (AAPL) v. Samsung (005930) trial draws near, Samsung’s turn at the plate kicked off on Monday evening with some interesting events. Apple had gone straight for the jugular with its arguments, stating that Samsung knowingly stole its technology and designs by meticulously examining each key element of the iPhone’s UI and ripping it off in its own products. Rather than get right to denying any wrongdoing, Samsung on Monday decided to take a different approach — prove Apple’s technology patents are not valid because they’re stolen to begin with.To start things off, Samsung targeted Apple’s pinch-to-zoom patent, which the Cupertino, California-based company claims is being infringed upon by a number of Samsung smartphones and tablets. Via Fortune, live coverage of the trial from San Jose Mercury News describes the courtroom events surrounding one of Samsung’s first key pieces of evidence: A giant table.Dubbed “Diamond Touch,” Samsung’s legal team presented a massive touchscreen table built by Mitsubishi to the jury in an effort to show that Apple’s patent on pinch-to-zoom technology should not be valid because it already existed for years before the first iPhone launched. What’s more, Samsung suggested that Apple knowingly stole the technology when its witness, Mitsubishi engineer Adam Bogue, testified that he showed the Diamond Touch to Apple engineers back in 2003.The Diamond Touch consists of a projector and a massive touch-sensitive surface with multi-touch support, on which users can draw and perform a variety of other functions. The device also supports technology that is strikingly similar to the pinch-to-zoom function in iOS, allowing Diamond Touch users to manipulate objects by grabbing the corners of an image or window and dragging.Since Samsung says technology similar to Apple’s pinch-to-zoom function already existed when Apple was granted its patent, the company is arguing that Prior Art should render Apple’s patent invalid.

Apple continued to be on the losing end of a public relations battle Tuesday over a "Not Recommended" rating from Consumer Reports for its iPhone 4. Some industry watchers have gone as far as to suggest a recall is something the company may need to consider.The latest round of bad news was courtesy of Wayne State University Professor Matthew Seeger, who told Cult of Mac that the brand image of Apple could be at risk and said the company will be forced to issue a recall.Others told the Apple enthusiast site that the company needs to act with more urgency, calling Apple's response so far lackluster and even irresponsible. While there seems to be general agreement that Apple has responded poorly, some see a recall as too harsh a step.Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner said in a note to clients that he saw the risk of recall as low, saying the antenna issue was not serious enough to warrant such an action. He argued that Apple should be giving out free "bumpers" to those with problems, and wouldn't affect overall profit margins more than 1 or 2 percentage points.Apple charges $30 for these bumpers, which cover up the metal stripe. This keeps users from touching the lower-left hand corner with their hand, which seems to set off the reception problems.The company is also attempting to control the debate: Apple blog TUAW noted that it had found evidence the company was deleting threads in its support forum that referenced the Consumer Reports ratings at least a half dozen times."It's hard to imagine what Apple hopes to gain by doing this," TJ Luoma wrote.Either way, Consumer Reports' words are having a chilling effect on Apple's stock. In intraday trading Tuesday, the stock had fallen as much as 4 percent over the recall worries. Apple's typical silence on issues like this is probably not making the situation any better.

Apple may have come out on top when a jury ruled that dozens of Samsung phones infringed on Apple patents and trade dress, but that doesn’t mean Samsung and other Android OEMs will simply let the new iPhone 5 hit the market without a bit or resistance. There are at least a dozen Android powered devices being prepped to battle the iPhone 5 in the marketplace, but HTC and Samsung may be holding trump cards that could give them a legal edge to block the iPhone 5 from ever hitting store shelves.It turns out that the iPhone 5 will be using the LTE radio standard for high-speed data transfer – a standard based on hundreds of different patents, some of which are held by HTC and Samsung. According to an industry source, “Samsung Electronics has decided to take immediate legal action against the Cupertino-based Apple. Countries in Europe and even the United States ? Apple’s home-turf ? are our primary targets.” Samsung has not taken any legal action yet, but we expect a patent infringement lawsuit to be filed in the following weeks.On the HTC side, the legal battle is already under way. HTC has presented its patent claims before a US International Trade Commission Judge. The legal battle is still playing out, but Judge Thomas Pender has let Apple know that “Clear and convincing means something to me; I have to be pretty darn certain a US patent is invalid,” when Apple lawyers disputed the validity of HTC’s LTE patents. HTC has been on the forefront of LTE since it launched the HTC Thunderbolt on Verizon’s LTE network in 2011 and has supplied LTE-enabled devices for all major LTE networks across the globe.We doubt that the courts will move fast enough to issue a preliminary injunction against Apple, which would hinder the initial launch of the iPhone 5, but it does look like Apple will be on the defensive this time around. Apple has 434 LTE patents of its own, but all Samsung and HTC need is for Apple to infringe on one of their patents to justify a court ordered injunction against the iPhone 5.While many of you would be thrilled to see Apple suffer at the hands of Samsung and HTC, we hope the parties involved will use this as an opportunity to settle their legal differences once and for all and set up cross-licensing agreements, so they can all compete with their products rather than spend millions of dollars on lawyers. We can all agree that the patent wars within the mobile space have gotten completely out of hand.What do you think will happen if iPhone 5 sales are banned from the US and Europe?Looking for more Android vs Apple news? Did you know that last week it was announced that the Galaxy S III has beat out iPhone 4S as top selling device in US? You do now. Curious how the new iPhone 5 compares to Android? We’ve got that too.

Web browser maker Opera topped the iPhone application download chart within 24 hours of releasing its free browser app.It has been downloaded 1,023,380 times since its launch on 14 April.It took three weeks for Apple to approve the program, which has already been developed for other mobile phone platforms.Opera Mini is not the first alternative to Apple's Safari to be developed for the iPhone.German developer Alexander Clauss launched an iPhone browser application called iCab in May 2009."It is probably the first well known PC browser to become available on the iPhone," said Forrester analyst Ian Fogg."There's no Firefox, no Internet Explorer - and there's not likely to be because of the development environment," he added."An app has to be written especially for a particular phone to offer a high quality experience. On many mobiles the browser provided with the phone is the only choice someone has."Opera has not developed a separate app for the iPad but says the iPhone program will also work on Apple's new device.Chief development officer Christen Krogh told the BBC that Opera's business model is similar to that of a traditional search engine, with revenue coming from affiliate deals and advertising rather than from the user."The web is still a place to make big bucks," he said. "Online ads are lucrative and that's growing on mobiles. The mobile ecosystem is becoming more like the web system."

Google's Motorola division claims Apple is infringing on seven of its patents and wants to block iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers from being imported to the U.S.Since Google’s acquisition of Motorola back in February, the Droid expert has stayed quiet about its previous grievances with Apple. But now, according to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola division has filed a new patent lawsuit against Apple (following Samsung’s lead), opening some old wounds leftover from Motorola and Apple’s long-standing legal disputes. The complaint, submitted to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), names features like location reminders, email notifications, along phone and video players as possible infringements.The complaints target Apple features used extensively in its product line up and given Google’s desire to block U.S. imports of Apple products (Apple manufactures its product line in Asia), a win would strike a major blow. Google seems to have its sights set on Apple destruction. The original patent dispute between Motorola Mobility and Apple was eventually dismissed in court, but Google’s Motorola division isn’t willing to lay it to rest.“We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple’s unwillingness to work out a license leaves us little choice but to defend ourselves and our engineers’ innovations,” wrote Motorola Mobility in an emailed statement.The official document pertaining to this specific case won’t be available until Monday, so we will have to wait until the weekend’s over to learn the full details. The inevitable battle between Apple and Google may be a whole lot closer than we thought. And it’s nice to know we’ll have more legal battles to obsess over since Apple and Samsung’s recent disputes will soon reach a verdict.FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes that an ITC judge already made a preliminary judgement in the previous Motorola vs. Apple case, arguing that Apple did infringe on one of Motorola’s patent. The final ruling in the original case is expected to be released sometime next week. It’s also important to recognize, as Mueller points out, that if Motorola does achieve a ban on Apple products in the previous lawsuit, the iPad 4G and iPhone 4S would be exempt. Both use a Qualcomm chipset falling outside Motorola’s patent claims.For mobile fans, Monday can’t come soon enough. Do you think Google and Motorola stand a chance against Apple?

This story was published in several major Canadian papers today. Atif Shamim, a Carleton engineering student has created an amazing new invention to prolong battery life in iPhones and blackberries. Read all about it.  An Ottawa inventor has pulled off something the titans of innovation behind the iPhone couldn’t — find a way to reduce power consumption of the “power-sucking” device to increase battery life.Atif Shamim, an electronics PhD student at Carleton University, has built a prototype that extends the battery life of portable gadgets such as the iPhone and BlackBerry, by getting rid of all the wires used to connect the electronic circuits with the antenna.Research on the invention, to be published in the upcoming edition of Microwave Journal, has already received international accolades.Last month, the article about the invention, co-authored by Muhammad Arsalan and adviser Langis Roy of Carleton’s department of electronics, was named the best paper at the European Wireless Technology Conference.The invention involves a packaging technique to connect the antenna with the circuits via a wireless connection between a micro-antenna embedded within the circuits on the chip.“This has not been tried before — that the circuits are connected to the antenna wirelessly. They’ve been connected through wires and a bunch of other components. That’s where the power gets lost,” Mr. Shamim said.He estimates his module consumes 12 times less power than the traditional, wired-transmitter module. It is also much simpler in design, lowering the overall cost of any hand-held device, he said.The judges at the European wireless conference lauded Carleton students’ paper for the “excellent integration of system design, material sciences and electromagnetic antenna design.” They also said the innovation is “highly relevant, with large potential for commercialization.”Mr. Shamim has filed patent applications in the U.S. and in Canada, in the knowledge consumers continue to gripe about the short lifespan of the iPhone battery.“It’s a common problem. There are so many applications in the iPhone, it’s like a power-sucking machine,” said Shamim.In June, 2007, Apple tried to answer critics who had given the iPhone low marks for its short battery life. Five months after unveiling the new product, the company announced the iPhone could now get up to eight hours of talk time, up from the five hours of talk time and 16 hours of audio playback at the launch.If an iPhone battery needs repairing, Apple will service it for $89, plus $10.77 for shipping for Canadian customers. All data on the iPhone is lost during the service, which normally takes three business days.Earlier this year, the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation honoured Mr. Shamim and Mr. Arsalan as student researchers of the year for their work in the field of wireless biomedical sensors. Also honoured was University of Ottawa student David Nadeau, for his contribution to the “more intelligent online search engine,” yooname.com

For the tech world, this has been the summer of patents. Oneto purchase Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion is to grab its 24,000 active and pending patents. This will help Google compete with Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, who recently banded together to buy their own batch of patents. Meanwhile, “patent squatters” who buy patents to extract cash from people who actually make things are suing independent software developers and, in the process, threatening their ability to innovate without fear of litigation.These stories about tech patents don’t just fascinate people who are techies, patent lawyers or clerks at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. When, you know they have attained the status of the Culturally Important.Meanwhile, a notorious filing from Apple has many concerned about what these companies actuallywith their patents. A few months ago, we discovered that Cupertinofor technology that would allow concert promoters to remotely disable concertgoers’ iPhone cameras. “So what?,” you ask.Imagine if police or repressive governments used the same technology to stop citizens from documenting abuses. Want to capture police brutality on your phone? The police could disable your camera and continue their crimes. Want to share scenes from a democratic protest in the Middle East with the rest of the world? Ditto.Cellphone cameras have become ubiquitous, and they’re already indispensable tools for free expression and democratic action. If Apple moves forward with this technology, you can bet anti-democratic forces will be quick to adapt it to their ends.That’s why we at Free Press and SavetheInternet.comfor even proposing such destructive technology.This week, I met up with an Apple representative to hand off the signatures of more than 25,000 activists who urged Apple CEO Steve Jobs to pull the plug on any project that would enable corporate or government censorship.Just for fun, we delivered the signatures in a Macbook Pro box.The Apple representative said he was happy to take these letters up the chain of command. That’s a start. But our members made it clear that such an idea -- even if it’s just one of thousands of patents filed every month -- runs counter to our democratic ideals, and that the public will  hold Apple accountable So as Big Company A fights with Big Company B over expensive patent portfolios, remember that individual patents are often the seeds of real technology that has real consequences. It’s our job to call these patent-hungry companies to task when they overreach.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, plans to slash the price of Apple's 16GB 3GS iPhone to $97 beginning Tuesday.Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) is widely expected to unveil a brand-new iPhone next month, and could be working with retailers to clear out its remaining inventory of the about-to-be-outdated model.FacebookDiggTwitterBuzz Up!EmailPrintComment on this storyAt the new price, customers will save $100 on Apple's smart phone, which currently sells for $199. The deal requires that the phone be purchased with a two-year contract from AT&T, the iPhone's exclusive service provider."It is our commitment to always lead on price," Mehrdad Akbar, Wal-Mart's (WMT, Fortune 500) senior category director for wireless, in a prepared statement about the price change.Apple sold 8.3 million iPhones last quarter, more than twice the amount sold during the same period a year ago.Wal-Mart's pre-Memorial Day price whack comes as technology giants such as Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), Research in Motion (RIM) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ, Fortune 500), which recently snapped up Palm, vie for top dog status in the smart phone market. Industry analysts say that worldwide smart phone sales topped 54 million units in the first quarter, up nearly 49% from a year ago.At $97, Wal-Mart's price slightly undercuts the $99 price tag several analysts anticipated for the remaining iPhone 3GS stock. When consumers get sight of a new iPhone model on the horizon, sales of the existing model typically falls off sharply.In the furor surrounding last month's theft of a new iPhone prototype, Apple filed legal documents claiming that leaked details of the new model would be "immensely damaging" to the company because "people that would have otherwise purchased a currently existing Apple product would wait for the next item to be released."

Another day, another Apple (AAPL) vs. Samsung (005930) trial. The two consumer electronics companies are preparing to do battle in San Jose, California next week, and now-public court documents shed light on the positions each firm is taking. On Tuesday, Apple told Samsung exactly what it thinks its technology patents are worth (spoiler: barely anything at all), and subsequent filings from Samsung reveal that the South Korea-based company has a few choice words for Apple as well.As highlighted by The Wall Street Journal, Samsung’s trial brief pulls no punches in telling the court exactly where it stands regarding Apple’s repeated patent-related accusations. In short, Apple is the thief here, not Samsung. A few key excerpts (emphasis is ours):Samsung has been researching and developing mobile telecommunications technology since at least as early as 1991 and invented much of the technology for today‘s smartphones. Indeed, Apple, which sold its first iPhone nearly twenty years after Samsung started developing mobile phone technology, could not have sold a single iPhone without the benefit of Samsung‘s patented technology.For good measure, Apple seeks to exclude Samsung from the market, based on its complaints that Samsung has used the very same public domain design concepts that Apple borrowed from other competitors, including Sony, to develop the iPhone. Apple‘s own internal documents show this. In February 2006, before the claimed iPhone design was conceived of, Apple executive Tony Fadell circulated a news article that contained an interview of a Sony designer to Steve Jobs, Jonathan Ive and others. In the article, the Sony designer discussed Sony portable electronic device designs that lacked “excessive ornamentation” such as buttons, fit in the hand, were “square with a screen” and had “corners [which] have been rounded out.”Contrary to the image it has cultivated in the popular press, Apple has admitted in internal documents that its strength is not in developing new technologies first, but in successfully commercializing them. . . . Also contrary to Apple‘s accusations, Samsung does not need or want to copy; rather, it strives to best the competition by developing multiple, unique products. Samsung internal documents from 2006, well before the iPhone was announced, show rectangular phones with rounded corners, large displays, flat front faces, and graphic interfaces with icons with grid layouts.Apple relied heavily on Samsung‘s technology to enter the telecommunications space, and it continues to use Samsung‘s technology to this day in its iPhone and iPad products. For example, Samsung supplies the flash memory, main memory, and application processor for the iPhone. . . .  But Apple also uses patented Samsung technology that it has not paid for. This includes standards-essential technology required for Apple‘s products to interact with products from other manufacturers, and several device features that Samsung developed for use in its products.It’s clear that we’re in for yet another action-packed adventure when the trial kicks off next week.

Historically, research suggests that web search on mobile phones has been limited when compared to the diverse set of queries which comprise computer-based search. Researchers attribute the homogeneous mobile search behavior in part to the phone's form factor and browsing capabilities. However, our new logs-based study indicates that high-end phones, like the iPhone, are changing the landscape of mobile search. We found that search from these phones has evolved not only to mimic computer web search patterns, but to exceed the expectations set by conventional web search in some cases.We see iPhone searches mimicking computer-based search behavior in terms of query length (~3 words per query for computer and iPhone queries, as opposed to 2.5 words per query for conventional mobile queries) and query classification (notably the percentage of Adult and Entertainment searches have decreased on the iPhone relative to conventional mobile phones). But what is most surprising to us is that frequent searchers on iPhone surpass frequent searchers on computers in terms of the diversity of queries they issue. In other words, people are using high-end phones to search for a more diverse set of information needs than computers are used for; we jokingly refer to this as the "bar-bet" phenomenon -- or the "pub-quiz" phenomenon for those of you in the UK.We devised a metric for quantifying the variability of a user’s search intentions across time. This variability metric, entro-percent, is a normalized entropy metric which compares the number of search tasks issued by a user to the number of categories those search tasks fall under. This user-variability for conventional mobile web search is much lower than for computer-based search, confirming the hypothesis that mobile web users query over a much less diverse set of topics. The surprising news is that iPhone users, on the other hand, had a higher variability than computer based users, indicating their information needs are more diverse! This shows that the challenges posed by a phone's form factor can be outweighed by its "always on, always in your pocket" benefits.To understand the meaning of the entro-percent equation, read our full paper summarizing the findings of our logs-based study of search patterns on conventional mobile phones, iPhones and conventional computers and get all the juicy details.

The patent brawl between Samsung and Apple marches on. Samsung on Tuesday filed amendment documents requesting to add the iPhone 5 to its existing suit against the Cupertino company.Samsung accuses Apple’s latest smartphone of infringing eight of its patents, the same ones it claims Apple’s new iPad, iPad 2, iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, and iPod touch also infringe. In its filing, Samsung states, “The iPhone 5 has the same accused functionality as the previously accused versions of the iPhone, so the proof of infringement of the patents-in-suit by the iPhone 5 is the same as for other Apple devices already accused of infringement in this litigation.”To justify adding the iPhone 5 to the previous filing, Samsung states in its amendment that it “could not have known whether the rumored iPhone 5 would practice its patented technologies when it filed its infringement contentions on June 15. The product was not on the market at that time and could not have been included in the contentions.”Nonetheless, Samsung had already threatened to sue Apple over the iPhone 5 this month. And earlier reports indicated that Samsung had planned to add the iPhone 5 to its list of infringing Apple devices once it confirmed that the smartphone had 4G LTE capability.The news comes just over month after a U.S. jury found Samsung guilty of violating many of Apple’s design patents. The jury decided Samsung owed Apple close to $1.05 billion in damages.

Jed Stremel, Director of Mobile at Facebook, just announced at our Mobile Web Wars Roundtable that Facebook’s iPhone/iPod app has reached 1 million users.Facebook is currently ranked as the 6th most popular free application on Apple’s App Store, and has been among the store’s top applications since the store’s launch on July 10. We posted initial download numbers for the apps soon after the store’s launch (Facebook had around 9,000 downloads at the time). Since then, Apple has changed its policy and no longer posts the number of downloads for each app, so we need to rely on developers to report their figures.We’ve asked MySpace for their corresponding numbers. Off hand, John Faith, GM and VP of Mobile for MySpace was able to tell us that their mobile WAP site sees 1.7 million uniques a day (users can access the MySpace WAP site without using the native application). This is certainly a large figure, but it doesn’t provide a direct comparison. We’ll update the post when we can get more comparable numbers.At Facebook’s f8 conference this week, the company announced that it would soon be open sourcing its iPhone application, so we can expect to see a number of copy cats in the near future.

Oh, Nick Lee, you clever boy you. See, Nick here tricked Apple with a very simple iPhone application: Handy Light. On the surface it looked just like any other $0.99 flashlight application. But, secretly, it was a lot more useful.Handy Light allowed you to make your iPhone's screen go blank with a color of your choice. You opened it, clicked a swatch from a simple palette, and that was it: Life in technicolor. Another stupid flashlight application like a hundred others. Or so the App Store team thought.Inside, the app contained hidden code that made it a full tethering application—a program that allows you to use your iPhone as a 3G modem. Using this ability you can surf the web from your computer, using the iPhone as a bridge to the internet. You can do this using your iPhone's preferences too, but that way you will have to pay the additional $20 per month that AT&T wants you to pay for this kind of service. That is $20 extra on top of whatever you are paying for your iPhone data plan. With Handy Light, the tethering service was completely free.It worked beautifully: You just needed to set up a Wi-Fi network in your laptop, connect your iPhone to it, change a few parameters in your computer's Wi-Fi settings, and that was it. Within seconds, your notebook was able to surf the web. And yes, I say was. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. The app was pulled from iTunes as soon as news of its true nature appeared online. Those who downloaded it, however, can keep enjoying its benefits.Click to viewA great story with a sad ending. Hopefully, they will keep republishing similar apps as they take them down. Developers: Let's try this again. [App Shopper, MacRumors, Forbes, AppStore HQ]

Do you remember the GooPhone i5? It sounded like something you’d buy at a joke shop that would spurt some odious fluid down the inner cochlea of an unsuspecting victim who held it up to his ear, but it was actually a wonderfully brazen knock-off of the upcoming sixth-generation iPhone.And hilariously, this pre-emptive copycat is already threatening to sue Apple over the iPhone 5, claiming to have patented the design.The GooPhone i5 is pretty much your stock Chinese clone device of the most current iPhone. At first blush, it kind of looks similar to the iPhone, but it has inferior internals and runs Android 4.1 Jellybean instead of iOS.The difference, though, is that unlike most Chinese knock-offs, the makers of the GooPhone i5 managed to announce their device before Apple announced the new iPhone. They managed to do this because, compared to past iPhones, the appearance and design of the 2012 iPhone has been leaked months ahead of time all across the interne, giving the company ample time to swipe.In other words, just because they got out a working product first doesn’t mean they didn’t steal the GooPhone’s design from Apple. But tricksy, tricksy GooPhone is claiming that the opposite is true, and that they’ve already patented the GooPhone’s design in China, giving them the right to block the next iPhone from being sold in the country once it’s released.This seems like promotional bluster, but they may actually have a case: Chinese company Proview was able to successfully blackmail Apple out of $60 million over the “iPad” trademark.Even so, it’s hard to imagine how the GooPhone’s design could be patented, and if it is patented, how it could be applied successfully against the next iPhone. For one, although both have similar shapes, Apple owns patents on the iPhone’s general shape going back years, and that patent is enforceable at least in the United States, as Samsung recently discovered to their peril. In addition, the GooPhone i5 has completely different dimensions than the next iPhone, and the two-toned back on the GooPhone is just for show, where as on the next iPhone it’s most likely an integrated part of the handset’s antenna designRead more at http://www.cultofmac.com/188571/goophone-claims-to-have-already-patented-the-next-iphones-design-will-ban-sales-in-china/#0jg1WrcqTmJWgkZ2.99

Court in Seoul rules that both technology giants infringed on each other's patents in battle for smartphone supremacy.Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple in Seoul in April last year regarding infringement of patents [Reuters]Apple and Samsung have been banned from selling some of their products in South Korea, after a court ruled that they both infringed on each other's patents on mobile devices. The court ruling on Friday comes as the two firms are locked in a bitter patent battle that could determine their fight for supremacy in the global smartphone market. The Seoul Central District Court ordered Apple to remove the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad 1 and iPad 2 from store shelves in South Korea, ruling that the products infringed on two of Samsung's telecommunications patents. The court also ruled that Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung had infringed on one of Apple's patents related to the screen's bounce-back ability and banned sales of the Galaxy S2 and other products in South Korea. Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple in Seoul in April last year regarding infringement of patents related to telecommunications standards. Apple responded in June by filing a counter suit claiming Samsung copied the design and user interface of its iPhone and iPad. The split ruling is not expected to make any impact on the broader dispute which involves legal action in several nations including the US and Australia. The South Korean decision comes ahead of a high-stakes US jury verdict that is expected to signal the future course of the rival firms' tussle for smartphone supremacy. In the US court, Apple is seeking more than $2.5bn after accusing the Korean firm of infringing designs and other patents. Samsung says Apple infringed its patents for wireless communication. It is one of several legal cases around the world involving the two electronics giants in the hottest part of the tech sector - tablet computers and smartphones. While the results so far have been mixed in courts in Europe and Australia, Samsung has a lot at stake in the US case, which could result in large damages or injunctions against its products in the American market. A recent survey by research firm IDC showed Samsung extended its lead over Apple in the smartphone market in the second quarter despite slowing demand for mobile phones. Samsung shipped 50.2 million smartphones globally in the April-June period, while Apple sold 26 million iPhones. IDC said Samsung held 32.6 per cent of the market to 16.9 per cent for Apple. Samsung has steadfastly denied abusing Apple patents and countered in court that Apple has been taking advantage of some of the South Korean company's patented technology for wireless connections. The battle is all the more complex as Apple and Samsung are not only competitors in the fast-growing global market for smartphones and tablet computers, but also have a close business relationship. Samsung, the world's biggest manufacturer of memory chips and liquid crystal displays, supplies some of the key components that go into Apple products.

A new security hole has opened up in Apple Inc.'s iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, raising alarms about the susceptibility of some of the world's hottest tech gadgets to hacker attacks.Flaws in the software running those devices came to light after a German security agency warned that criminals could use them to steal confidential data off the devices. Apple, the world's largest technology company by market value, said Thursday that it is working on a fix that will be distributed in an upcoming software upgrade.With the security hole, an attacker can get malicious software onto a device by tricking its owner into clicking an infected PDF file. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security called the flaws "critical weaknesses" in Apple's iOS operating system.Internet-connected mobile devices are still subject to fewer attacks than personal computer, but they could eventually prove a juicy target for hackers because they are warehouses of confidential banking, e-mail, calendar, contact and other data.Software vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. What makes the latest discovery alarming is that the weaknesses are already being actively exploited - albeit in a consensual way.The latest concerns were prompted by the emergence of a new version of a program to allow Apple devices to run any software and circumvent the restrictions that Apple notoriously retains over software distributed through its online store. There are security risks of doing so, but many people find it liberating to install their own software.Although this program is something people would seek out, the weaknesses that its authors discovered could easily be used for malice, security experts say.There is an irony in the controversy: The site distributing the program offers a fix for the problem, but to get the fix, a user has to first install the program in question. So a user must defy Apple's restrictions to get the protection until Apple comes up with a fix of its own.Charlie Miller, a prominent hacker of Apple products, said it likely took months to develop the program to break Apple's restrictions, but a criminal might need only a day or two to modify it for nefarious purposes.Apple Inc. spokeswoman Bethan Lloyd said Thursday the company is "aware of this reported issue and developing a fix." She would not say when the update will be available.One reason for gadget owners to take heart: Attacks on smartphones and other Internet gadgets are still relatively rare. One reason is PC-based attacks are still highly lucrative. Still, vulnerabilities such as the ones Apple is confronting show that consumers should take care of securing their mobile devices as they would their home computer."These things are computers - they're just small, portable computers that happen to have a phone tacked onto them," said Marc Fossi, manager of research and development for Symantec Security Response. "You've got to treat them more like a computer than a phone. You have to be aware of what's going on with these devices."©2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A 25-year-old Best Buy employee who posted a snarky cartoon spoof of iPhone zealots online has been suspended and may soon be out of a job.Brian Maupin, who worked at a Best Buy branch in Independence, Mo., since 2007, was suspended from his job Thursday, according to the Associated Press, and now expects to be fired by Monday for posting the two YouTube videos that slam fans of the iPhone 4 and HTC Evo 4G. Those videos don't mention Best Buy, which sells both phones.The AP quoted an e-mail from Best Buy spokesman Justin Barber, who said Friday that the consumer electronics chain was still deciding how to proceed with Maupin, whom he called an "aspiring filmmaker."Although Maupin's bosses failed to see the humor in the videos, a lot of other people have, apparently. At last look, more than 1.7 million people have viewed the iPhone video on YouTube. It features a 3.28-minute conversation between an increasingly exasperated electronics store salesman trying to talk a shopper into considering a smartphone other than the Apple smartphone. The video targeting Evo buyers (following the jump) had racked up more than 357,000 views."They felt it disparaged a brand they carried (iPhone/Apple) as well as the store itself and were fearful of stockholders and customers being turned off to Best Buy Mobile," Maupin said in an interview with TechCrunch.Maupin told TechCrunch he was asked to quit but refused the request. At that point, Maupin says he was told of his suspension in advance of a review of the matter by the company's human resources department. "I issued a statement to them explaining that the video was intended to be comedic and hence, not taken seriously by them or all these stockholders and customers they are worried about [being] turned off to buying from them due to the video,' Maupin said.(Reader advisory: the language in the videos gets a bit spicy in parts.)

A TV ad for Apple's iPhone has been banned by the UK's advertising watchdog for misleading consumers after it over-hyped the internet capabilities of the smart phone.The ad showed the internet navigation prowess of the iPhone, with images zooming in on a weather forecast for Cape Town and a map of how to get to Heathrow airport."You never know which part of the internet you'll need ... which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iPhone," ran a voiceover.The Advertising Standards Authority received two complaints that the claim was misleading because the iPhone did not support Flash or Java, which are both integral to many web pages.Apple said the aim of the ad was to highlight how the iPhone can offer access to all websites, while many other handsets only offer lower-level access to WAP versions of sites or those selected by service providers.The US technology giant said that Safari, the web browser the iPhone uses, was built to open internet standards.Flash and Java technology were not open source, said Apple, adding that it could not ensure compatibility with "every third-party technology in the marketplace".The company said none of the content in the ad was Java or Flash-based and that the line "all parts of the internet" meant website availability, "not every aspect of functionality".Advertising pre-vetting service Clearcast said the ad had been given the green light for broadcast after a "demonstration and the advertiser's assurances".However, the Advertising Standards Authority said that claims made by Apple implied that "users would be able to access all websites and see them in their entirety".Because the ad had not explained the limitations of the iPhone, the ASA concluded that "the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iPhone".The ASA ordered that the TV ad must not be broadcast again in the same form.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

A pair of workers who claim to have been poisoned by toxins in a Suzhou, China factory while assembling touchscreens for Apple’s iPhone have written an open letter begging consumers to demand reform. SumOfUs, the organization behind the Ethical iPhone Campaign, released the letter in an email to the media on Wednesday afternoon. The letter was written by Guo Rui-qiang and Jia Jing-chuan, two former factory workers who urge consumers to sign SumOfUs’s petition and demand that Apple force its suppliers and manufacturing partners to improve working conditions at their Chinese factories. Both workers claim to have been poisoned by a chemical cleaner called N-hexane, and they have suffered neurological damage as a result. The Fair Labor Association is currently conduction inspections of two Foxconn factories, prompted by Apple, and while only preliminary inspections have been made at this point, the organization says it has already found “tons of issues.” The workers’ letter follows below in its entirety.You don’t know us but you have seen our work. Until recently, we worked long hours assembling Apple’s iPhone touch screens in Suzhou, China.In early 2010, it was independently confirmed that 137 workers, including us, were poisoned by a chemical called n-hexane which was used to clean iPhone screens. N-hexane is known to cause eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and leads to persistant nerve damage. Apple admitted to gross labour rights violations more than a year later.If more people know about what we went through, Apple will feel pressured to change so other workers don’t have to suffer like we did.Can you share this letter with your friends, and ask them to join you in signing our petition calling for a reform of working conditions at their factories?We have been pressuring Apple, and its new CEO Tim Cook, for years to compensate those of us who were injured working for them, and demanding reform of working conditions at their Chinese factories so that their workers don’t suffer like we do. Now we need your help as customers or potential customers of Apple.We need your help to send a message to Apple before their shareholder meeting on Thursday, Feb. 23rd. We want to see a strict corporate social responsibility and reform of the audit system to prevent similar tragedies in the future. He will listen to you as current or potential consumers.You’ve already signed the petition, and 82,000 others have too — for that, we thank you. We believe it’d be symbolicly powerful if 100,000 people signed the petition before SumOfUs delivers it to Tim Cook on Thursday at their shareholder meeting. We’re really close to that goal, but we need you to share our request with your friends to get over the edge.Can you share our letter with your friends, and ask them to sign the petition too?It has been over two years since many of us were hospitalized and treated but our debilitating symptoms continue. Rui-Qiang still can’t find work because he can no longer stand for the long hours most jobs require. Jing-Chuan has to spend nearly $100 a month on health supplements.But with all of us working together to pressure Apple to change, we can make sure what happened to us doesn’t happen to others too.

If you can’t be bothered to wait for the iPhone 5, then how about this?A German engineer has created a 10 times scale version of the iPhone 4 with a 40 inch screen which offers iPhone-esque computer functions - but also doubles up as a table.The ‘iTableous’ has exactly the same design as the Apple mobile right down to the on and off buttons, the camera and the accelerometer.It is covered by 8mm strong plexiglass and can flip onto its side to make using it more easy.But before you start placing your order, be aware that the iTableous isn't quite as hi-tech as it might appear. It does not have a touchscreen and can’t even be used to make phone calls.Its creator Benjamin Bachmeier has admitted that it functions more like a desktop computer, although it can connect to the Internet via wireless 3G.The iTableous is 118cm long and 58.9cm wide, around 10 times larger than the iPhone 4, which is 11.5cm long and 5.8cm wide.It uses a 40inch 920 x 1080 Toyota LCD monitor instead of a touch screen - so while you can't control it with a finger-swipe, it is at least satisfyingly large.Users operate the computer using a keyboard and a mouse sitting on or next to the screen.Just like a real iPhone the speakers are at the bottom of the case, only these ones are powered with a subwoofer, two mid range tweeters and two other speakers.The Home button does not work but lifts up to hide a 30-pin connector - so you can connect devices, including, oddly, a real iPhone.The iTableous runs off Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6.7 and has a 500GB hard disk and 4GB of RAM being powered by a GHz Zotac Ionitx processor.At the top just where the camera should be Mr Bachmeier has installed a 5.7-megapixel HD camera right which allows video conferencing when connected to the Internet.He has also converted what is normally the sleep button to a giant power switch.Other parts include a flap which appears to be a giant SIM card cover, but actually opens up to let you look at the circuitry inside.The connections include a line-in port, one USB 2.0 port as per an Apple computer, a SuperDrive, two HDMI ports and a DVB-T antenna cable.The swinging function flips the entire device 90 degrees on its side so the user can sit on the floor whilst using it.The other alterations include four internal fans plus an additional one Mr Bachmeier has fashioned himself to reduce the noise of the computer.

Over the last two weeks countless blog posts and articles have been written about the Gizmodo/iPhone leak and the subsequent police investigation. Few have been as scathing toward Apple as a segment that aired on tonight’s Daily Show. And while Apple has long made a habit of mostly ignoring what the press and media says about it, you can be sure this will get their attention.In the segment, host Jon Stewart lambasts Apple for the police raid on Gizmodo editor Jason Chen’s house, and the fact that Apple employees showed up on the doorstep of the guy who originally found the phone. Stewart’s report glosses over some important points in the case and gets a few details wrong. But ultimately that doesn’t really matter — Stewart’s audience probably doesn’t care if there’s a chance a crime was committed here. To them, a guy found a phone in the bar, photos of it were posted on the Internet, and A
