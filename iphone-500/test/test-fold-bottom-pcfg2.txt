After all the hubbub and controversy caused by the release of SingPlayer for iPhone back in May, we knew it would take a serious change of heart for AT&T to reverse course on the issue of 3G streaming . The app's super-conspicuous lack of 3G was one of the clearest statements around that the iPhone represented a level of data consumption that AT&T was fairly unprepared for, and that certain uses like VoIP over 3G and live video streams were just not going to fly. Well, we've just now gotten over that VoIP hump , and now AT&T has given in to SlingPlayer demand at last. AT&T says it has been testing an "optimized" version of the app on its 3G network since December, and Sling says the dynamic bandwidth adjustment should keep the app from bringing the network to grinding halt -- in not so many words. The 3G-friendly version will be a free upgrade to the $30 application, and should be available as soon as the revised software makes its way through the App Store approval process.

Digg's Kevin Rose has a solid (but far from perfect ) track record when it comes to Apple rumors, and he just drove the nerds of SXSWi crazy with his latest gaze into the crystal ball: he says the iPhone 3.0 will have copy and paste. Kev says that the interface is much like the magnifying glass -- you use two fingers to select the text you want, and then you can cut or copy. Sure, that's great, but we think the bigger news is that Rose says 3.0 won't have support for background apps -- which makes his claim that that 3.0 will bring the iPhone "up to speed with the Palm Pre" a little suspect. We'll find out what's what in just a few days , but in the meantime check the video of Rose after the break.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureiPhone users expecting their Passcode Lock to prevent thieves running up their bill will be disappointed, as it emerges that the "Emergency Call" button actually allows any number to be dialled.While most users are happy to keylock their iPhone with the sliding finger, some opt to configure a passcode to lock the device more effectively - suffering the inconvenience of entering their PIN every time they use the phone. But while that process will protect data on the device (unlike last time) it won't stop a pickpocket running up your phone bill by making calls to any number.But it neglects to define what numbers constitute an emergency, and it turns out that, in the UK at least, the user is permitted to call anyone they wish.This could be described as a feature - one man's emergency is another's routine call - but we can't help wondering if the typical user is really aware of this particular feature, or if the manual could have been a bit more explicit in stating that someone experiencing an emergency is free to call on support from anywhere. ®

The iPhone 4 's massive launch hasn't been blemish free, with reports of spotty displays (which seem to have disappeared) and antenna woes being rather widely reported. Well -- it looks like it's possible there's another issue too -- this time with the proximity sensor. Now, we're no strangers to spontaneously turning on speakerphone with our faces (though admittedly our cheeks are pretty round), so it's hard to say if this is an iPhone 4-specific issue, but the mounting reports would suggest that it's possible the new handsets sensor is a little bit... over sensitive. Reported issues include accidentally disconnecting calls, throwing the speakerphone switch, and putting people on hold accidentally. What about you? Are you having problems with your iPhone 4's proximity sensor? Let us know in the comments.

AT&T is circulating a survey among some of its longer-term iPhone users with a checklist of features they'd like to see. It's a follow-up to a similar survey a few months back, and apparently also serves to judge reactions to the 2.1 firmware. Some of the most regular complaints make the list, including picture messaging through MMS, landscape mode for email, a user-replaceable battery, and the all-mighty cut and paste. The survey probably doesn't imply any kind of imminent changes, but it's nice to hear that AT&T is trying to listen to what we've all been screaming for so long. [ AppleInsider

When Steve Jobs first dreamed up the iPhone with his team at Apple, he didn't want it to run on AT&T's network. He wanted to create his own network.So says Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Stanton, who spent a good deal of time with the late Apple CEO during the phone's development period. Jobs wanted to replace carriers completely, Stanton says, instead using the unlicensed spectrum that WiFi operates on for his phone."He and I spent a lot of time talking about whether synthetically you could create a carrier using WiFi spectrum," Stanton said on Monday at the Law Seminar International Event in Seattle. "That was part of his vision."Both WiFi and cellular frequencies belong on the ultra-high-frequency level of the radio frequency spectrum. WiFi takes up five channels of the 2.4 GHz band. Other frequency bands are allotted to various purposes and cellular providers by the FCC.Jobs gave up his plans to create his own network in 2007, ultimately settling on a deal with AT&T.When Jobs debuted the iPhone, it marked a huge change in the way phone makers and carriers developed a device. Jobs sold AT&T Apple's iPhone sight unseen. Previously, carriers were an integral part of device development, adding tweaks, features and software throughout the process. Not so with the iPhone. Apple orchestrated the entire phone experience, while AT&T was simply afforded the opportunity to sell it. Android and other major mobile phone platforms followed this model with their smartphones later on, though to a lesser degree.It's not outrageous to think Jobs and Stanton spoke candidly about network matters, given Stanton's long history with wireless carriers. He was the first employee at McCaw Cellular, the national wireless provider that later became AT&T Wireless. He started another firm called Western Wireless, which birthed an operator called Voicestream that was bought out by Deutsche Telekom and became T-Mobile.I'd be interested to find out what sort of challenges Apple encountered trying to develop and get a phone to work properly just on the WiFi spectrum. The company certainly could have just bought out an existing carrier with its billions in the bank. Either option must have been too costly or provided too little pay-off to make it worthwhile.

Xbox SmartGlass for Android and iPhone will be coming in early 2013, Microsoft has told us, following a demo of the innovative service on Windows 8. SmartGlass was first demonstrated back at E3 in June 2012.Xbox SmartGlass will give you expanded control and integration with your Xbox 360 from your smart device. It's going to be available across Microsoft's platforms (Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT) from launch, before landing on other platforms in early 2013.UPDATE: It looks like the Android app has already arrived, you can read about it here.SmartGlass will give you the ability to use your phone as a controller as long as you are on the same network as your console, a function already available through the My Xbox Live companion app on iPhone (pictured above).Although Microsoft is yet to show SmartGlass on all these platforms, we do have some screens from Xbox SmartGlass for Android, iPhone and iPad in the gallery below. We've included a screen from the Android and iPhone apps just below, so you know what to expect.SmartGlass will allow control over movies and music, moving playback from one device to another, so you can pause on your tablet and resume on your Xbox, back on the big screen. It will also allow your mobile device to act as a second screen for things like movies and music, providing information on actors or artists.This second-screen experience extends to supported games: for example, it will provide a GPS map for Forza Horizon or let you line up the next track for Dance Central 3, we have been told.It will act as a remote for the new Xbox Internet Explorer browser, so you can zoom using pinch on your display.Xbox SmartGlass will be available in Windows 8, which launches on 26 October and Windows Phone 8, launching 29 October, initially. You will need an Xbox Live Gold subscription for some SmartGlass features to work and we're not certain exactly which features Android and iOS users will get.Once we've got firm dates for SmartGlass on other platforms, we'll bring you all the details.

Nielsen's just released a study confirming what some other studies have already concluded -- that Android devices account for the single largest swath of smartphone users in the US, with 39 percent OS share as of the second quarter. That compares with 28 percent for iOS, although Apple still reigns as the country's top-selling device maker. Simply put, that's a reflection of the fact that Apple is the only outfit churning out iOS devices, whereas a bevy of companies led by HTC, Motorola, and Samsung have helped make Android the dominant OS in the states. And let's not forget about RIM, another hardware / software shop, which still commands a 20 percent chunk of the market. Rounding out the list, Windows Phone and Windows Mobile account for nine percent, largely thanks to sales of HTC handsets, while webOS and Symbian each eked out two percent. At this point we don't doubt that Android is the most ubiquitous mobile operating system this side of the Atlantic, although it's worth noting that Nielsen based its results on a sample of roughly 20,000 people -- all of whom are postpaid subscribers.

The Quip app promised to let people send pictures to each other for free — like sending a multimedia message but without any fees.What it didn't say was that anyone with a few web skills could see them as well.Quip stored the private images on a publicly accessible web server without any encryption, making them easy prey for savvy internet users.Now some of the most intimate moments of thousands of people are being circulated on web forums.Many photos show people posing nude or having sex. Others show a day at the baseball or baby shots.One image shows a man naked from the waist up and seemingly covered in cuts and blood. Another seems to have been taken inside the White House.Some internet users have also allegedly matched up nude photos with real names and Facebook profiles.On one web forum, a user identifying as one of the makers of the Quip app said the system had been shut down."Hello, this is Ish, the founder of Addy Mobile, makers of the Quip app," said "ish_addy" on Reddit."As soon as this post came to our attention, we immediately shut down our servers. We have also now disabled all S3 access and have started to systematically secure all files in the system."We will not bring the system back up until we have adequate security around all files shared over Quip."However many of the photos, saved by people before the servers were shut down, are still being circulated.

News of a successful attack that almost instantly gives full access to an iPhone's password keychain made its way around the Web on Thursday after Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology revealed the exploit to IDG News Service. While the fact that hackers could access a device's keychain in such a short time certainly sounds alarming, the attack isn't entirely new, and is actually a product of Apple's "DRM approach" to security, one iOS security expert told Ars.Fraunhofer SIT's exploit first relies on physical access to an iPhone, so an attacker has to get your iPhone away from you before digging in. In most cases like this, you would likely want to use Apple's (now free) remote wipe feature in order to protect your data, but remote wipe is easily thwarted by removing the device's SIM card. Any attacker sophisticated enough to decrypt the keychain will know this trick.Once an attacker has your phone, he could use any of the commonly available jailbreaks to install an SSH server, install a keychain hacking script, and collect the decrypted password information.Part of what makes the attack relatively trivial is that the cryptographic key used for the keychain is stored on the iPhone. Once a device is jailbroken, hackers can use iOS's built-in APIs to access and decrypt certain passwords—including those for network access and e-mail accounts—stored in the keychain. From there, passwords from VPN access or e-mail accounts can be further used to gain more passwords, or e-mail accounts can be used to request password resets for a number of online services.But while Fraunhofer SIT's particular methods may be new, accessing the keychain and other encrypted information on a jailbroken iPhone has been possible for some time. iPhone forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski told Ars that similar exploits have been around since about the time of the introduction of the iPhone 3G."Several dev teams have been able to easily deduce Apple's encryption keys for the keychain; it just hasn't been widely advertised," Zdziarski said. The "new" part of Fraunhofer SIT's attack, however, leverages Apple's APIs to access the keychain instead of other methods.The real problem, according to Zdziarski, is that Apple hasn't yet fully implemented a truly secure environment for iOS. "Apple has—since introducing encryption—been relying on their DRM know-how, and just erasing the label that says 'DRM' and calling it 'security,'" he explained. "The problem with this is that DRM only makes things a little more difficult for hackers.""Real security relies on the strength of the key, and the secrecy of the key," Zdziarski continued. "And as long as the keys are all stored on the iPhone and don't rely on a user password, they can easily be compromised."In other words, even while Apple has continually improved the security of information on iPhones and other iDevices, the same types of flaws that enable moderately skilled hackers to access an entire unencrypted disk image of an iPhone still exist. And while Apple offers APIs for developers to add an additional layer of encryption for user data, it's up to developers to implement it independently.Zdziarski said that he believes Apple is pushing to make the iPhone compliant with security standards set forth in Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). When that happens, government and enterprise users can be less wary about iPhone security issues. "But at the end of the day," he said, "Apple will need to abandon their DRM approach if they want true security, as opposed to just some fancy marketing strategies."

Sizes go up, prices fall. These are the two hallmark rules of the TV land. Just a few years ago, $800 couldn’t buy you a screen much larger ... Read moreMost folks have accepted that they'll buy new cases almost every time they upgrade their iPhones, thanks to subtle — and occasionally rather bold — design changes. But repurchasing all their accessories, including charger cables and speaker docks? That is a tougher, pricier pill to swallow.According to TechCrunch's John Biggs, we should get our credit cards ready as that shopping spree is inevitable. At the very least you'll be looking at buying an extra cable or two (currently priced at $19) and, unless there are some third-party adapters out there to ease the pain, you may also have to kiss your current speaker dock goodbye.Biggs writes that "three independent manufacturers" told him that the next-generation iPhone will use a 19-pin port, rather than the wider 30-pin port found on current iPhones, iPads and iPods. If true, this news will make life a bit difficult for third-party accessory manufacturers, who have accepted Apple's 30-pin port design as a standard "since Apple released the third-generation iPod" in 2003, writes Biggs.As skeptical as I normally am regarding reports like this one, it's actually not all that unlikely that Apple would redesign the iPhone — and subsequently iPod and iPad — ports. The 19-pin design would save valuable space, after all, and interface technology has made major advancements in 10 years.Let's not forget, the Cupertino-based company recently redesigned the MagSafe, its proprietary magnetically-attached power connector, too, and that was only around since 2006.Want more tech news, silly puns, or amusing links? You'll get plenty of all three if you keep up with Rosa Golijan, the writer of this post, by following her on Twitter, subscribing to her Facebook posts, or circling her on Google+.

The iPhone has been hacked in the past to use modified external keyboards, but new mods promise much more general interaction. Now, iPhone expert Ralf Ackermann has succeeded in supporting a standard Bluetooth keyboard using an external Bluetooth approach and is working on supporting an internal one.For the external approach, Ackermann modified a Robotech Bluetooth module, which he placed in an iPhone battery sleeve and connected to the iPhone (serial) connector port at the bottom of the unit. This allowed the the phone to communicate directly with the the module using the Bluetooth serial port profile.The whole thing works courtesy of Jay "saurik" Freeman's Veency application. Ackermann used a tiny libvncclient to generate keyboard events, which were then passed to Veency. Veency then provided the keyboard event injection using the iPhone's private Graphics Services framework.You can find out more about this external module project over at Ackermann's blog. He'll be posting schematics and code as he gets his site set up.Ars readers may be more excited, though, by his work on a completely internal solution. Here, Ackermann discovered BlueSn0w, part of the iBluetooth project. BlueSn0w (yes, its name is apparently inspired by the iPhone dev team's yellowsn0w) will scan for discoverable Bluetooth devices. According to this Flickr page, the module seems to enable the Bluetooth UART interface to communicateThe internal solution depends on gaining access to the Bluetooth module stack. "User space BT stacks are not common—nevertheless, of course they can be done," Ackermann told Ars. "In the past, I had a look at an adaptation of the Linux Bluez stack for ATMEL uCs for instance—and this seems similar." Once the stack becomes available, Ackermann believes a fully internal solution will be quickly usable. There is no time estimate on this due to the complete volunteer nature of the BlueSn0w project but it looks like hobbyists are drawing close to the goal.Allowing the iPhone to accept keyboard input from an external Bluetooth keyboard will move the iPhone forward in opening new opportunities for general computing and on-the-go note taking. Taking into account the iPhone's newly realized video out support, the entire platform looks like it's at the brink of a transformative revolution.

As more and more businesses are switching to Apple products, Jobs is trying to make the move on two of the biggest U.S banks to become iPhone supporters. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are considering whether to let employees use the Apple iPhone as an alternative to RIM’s Blackberry for corporate e-mail. The banks are currently testing software for the iPhone that is designed to make it secure enough for company messages. The tests are the latest sign that RIM may be losing its tight grip on the corporate smartphone market. Companies are experimenting with alternatives such as Apple’s iPhone or devices that use Google’s Android software. “People are delighted with their iPhones and Android phones and they want to use them for work,” said Roger Entner, head of telecom research at Nielsen Co. “The result is RIM now has real competition for corporate customers.”RIM is already losing out on the battle, losing 15 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading this year before today, while Apple had climbed 51 percent. Apple led by Jobs, reported last month that 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone, including Procter & Gamble Co., General Electric Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. is exploring whether to let works use Androids or iPhones for corporate e-mail.Currently Bank of America, which has about 284,000 employees and Citigroup, which has about 258,000 employees are deploying or testing the new smartphones out. The efforts are intended to widen the choice of devices employees can use, rather than replace the Blackberry. The trials at the two companies involve more than 1,000 employees, which typically takes four to six weeks, and will be followed by a pilot project before potentially wider implementation. Laura Hunter, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina- based Bank of America, declined to comment on any specific trials, adding that “we continuously evaluate new and innovative technologies.”Apple is taking steps to make its products more appealing to businesses and challenge the Blackberry, which won over Wall Street banks and corporations with is security and reliability. Apple is working to improve the iPhone’s security by strengthening encryption tools and adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with server computers that can wipeout or lock an iPhone if it’s lost. The company even enlisted computer-services provide Unisys Corp. to help it sell more devices to corporate customers. While both RIM and Apple’s share of the global mobile-phone market rose last quarter from a year earlier as more consumers upgraded to smartphones, Apple moved into fourth position, knocking RIM into fifth, according to research firm IDC. The popularity of Apple’s latest model, the iPhone 4, helped the company sell more handsets than its Canadian rival.What do you think of the iPhone moving to Corporate America?

AT&T is raising the fees it charges buyers of the iPhone and other smartphones if they break their two-year contracts, while lowering them for "dumb" phones to better align the fees with their real costs.Starting June 1, smartphone buyers will have to pay $325 for breaking their contract, up from $175 currently. For buyers of regular phones, the fee is being decreased by $25 to $150.The early termination fee goes down for every month customers stay in their contract — by $10 for smart phones and $4 for regular phones. So if a smart phone contract is broken after two months, the termination fee is reduced by $20 to $305.The changes only apply to new contracts and renewals.AT&T charges customers $199 for the latest model of the iPhone, but pays Apple far more than that. AT&T makes the subsidy back through the customer's service fees over the two-year contract period. AT&T likely loses money for every customer that breaks a contract and pays a $175 termination fee, but may break even with the new, higher fee. A new iPhone model is expected to be announced next month.Meanwhile, simpler phones may cost AT&T only $125 to buy, meaning that a $175 termination fee is excessive.Following the same logic, Verizon Wireless doubled its smartphone termination fees in November, from $175 to $350. Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile still charge the same termination fees for all types of phones: $200. All three also pro-rate the fees for customers who leave later in their contracts.The Federal Communications Commission has questioned Verizon Wireless about the higher termination fees for smartphone users, but hasn't taken any action.The pro-rating of the fees came about after the carriers settled several class-action lawsuits by customers who found it unfair that they paid the full termination fee when breaking a contract after nearly two years.

Thomas Suarez is in the 6th grade at a middle school in the South Bay. And while most of his peers are probably fussing over new soccer kleets or watching the Disney channel, he’s creating iOS apps and giving TED Talks.Suarez, who’s not even old enough to have a Facebook account, has been fascinated by computers and technology since before kindergarten. He’s established his own company, CarrotCorp and has made two iOS apps that are currently in the App Store: Earth Fortune, which displays different colors of Earth depending on what your fortune is and his most successful- Bustin Jieber, a Whac-a-Mole for Justin Bieber.“A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them,” he says. “And it’s difficult because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program…And not many parents have written apps.” Suarez, inspired by Steve Jobs, started an App Club at school where any student can come to learn to design an app. In the future, Suarez wants to create more apps, more games and get into Android programming and development. He plans on continuing his app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.Knowing that human beings such as Suarez exist makes me really hopeful and excited for the future.

Motorola and Verizon invited comparisons, and that's what they gotThe Droid lands in stores Friday, and on Thursday the heavyweight reviewers -- which is to say the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg and the New York Times' David Pogue -- weighed in.Given that Motorola (MOT) and Verizon (VZ) pitched the Droid in its first TV ad as everything Apple's (AAPL) and AT&T's (T) iPhone was not, it was perhaps inevitable that every reviewer so far, including these two, treated its arrival as a grudge match.Mossberg's review is positive but tepid -- especially the video version. He plods through the comparisons item by item like a slightly boring homework assignment. His top-line summary:"While it has some significant drawbacks, I regard it as a success overall. It's the best super-smart phone Verizon offers, the best Motorola phone I've tested and the best hardware so far to run [Google's (GOOG)] Android. I can recommend the Droid to Verizon loyalists who have lusted for a better smart phone, but don't want to switch networks." (link)Pogue being Pogue has more fun with the assignment, even running a Twitter contest to come up with a new term for these newfangled gizmos. (He's going with "app phones"; Mossberg calls them "super-smart phones.") Pogue's bottom line:Since Verizon seems to want a Droid-iPhone faceoff, here it is: the Droid wins on phone network, customizability, GPS navigation, speaker, physical keyboard, removable battery and openness (free operating system, mostly uncensored app store). The iPhone wins on simplicity, refinement, thinness, design, Web browsing, music/video synching with your computer, accessory ecosystem and quality/quantity of the app store." (link)For a more thorough comparison, written by someone who actually seems to care, check out developer Greg Kumparak's 2,500 word review in TechCrunch. His conclusion: "At this point, I honestly feel that either choice would make any sane person incredibly happy."

In late March, four US Senators banded together and wrote a letter to Apple asking that they remove apps that alert users as to the whereabouts of DUI checkpoints.“With more than 10,000 Americans dying in drunk-driving crashes every year,” the letter stated, “providing access to iPhone and iPad applications that alert users to DUI checkpoints is harmful to public safety. We know that your company shares our desire to end the scourge of drunk driving and we therefore would ask you to remove these applications from your store.”While some of these apps make use of information housed in publicly accessible databases, many of them rely on crowdsourcing. Indeed, one app singled out by the letter is alleged to have had approximately 10 million users actively alerting “each other to DUI checkpoints in real time.”In a separate letter sent concurrently by US Sentator Charles Schumer, Schumer also called out apps like Trapster and PhantomAlert which work to alert users as to the whereabouts of police speed traps and red light cameras.Well, Apple took those letters to heart, partially.In revised app store guidelines discovered by Mac Rumors, Apple has updated Section 22.8 to now read:So one out of two ain’t bad, and in all honesty, Apple made the right decision here.DUI checkpoint apps do nothing more than tell potentially intoxicated drivers where not to go. They’re still driving drunk, just on the down low. Apps like Trapster, however, might effectively work to cut down on speeding when a police speed trap is noted. Though to be fair, it might encourage speeders to pick their spots more strategically.Either way, drunk driving is a lot more serious and contentious than speeders which is probably why Apple chose to only address DUI checkpoint apps.We should note, however, that DUI checkpoint apps already on the iTunes App Store haven’t been kicked out and we’ll have to wait and see if they’re grandfathered in or if they’ll eventually be removed. Take DUI Dodger, for example, which enables users to view and submit checkpoints in their area.

Developing applications for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is big business, and it's one that Novell (NASDAQ: NOVL) wants a piece of. Novell today released new software called MonoTouch that aims to bring .NET applications to the iPhone.MonoTouch is based on Novell's Mono project, which is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework. Unlike Mono, MonoTouch is neither free nor open source and is being sold as a commercial product by Novell. With MonoTouch, Novell is expanding the developer base for iPhone applications beyond just C to include .NET and its millions of global developers.Miguel de Icaza, vice president for developer platforms at Novell, explained that MonoTouch is built from the same source code base as Mono, but there are some differences."Mono is a traditional .NET implementation with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler," De Icaza told InternetNews.com. "The iPhone has both a legal and technical limitation for interpreters in general, so we had to modify it."He added that MonoTouch includes a static compiler, which means that there are some dynamic things that developers are used to doing with .NET that they won't be able to do with MonoTouch. In particular, he noted that the add-on IronPython and IronRuby languages do not currently work with MonoTouch.De Icaza added that there is no magic porting tool for traditional .NET applications to run on MonoTouch for the iPhone. The reason is due to the dynamic compiler issues, which can affect software libraries.The 1.0 launch of MonoTouch follows a relatively rapid development cycle from De Icaza and his team. He said the first MonoTouch prototype was completed in early May, and the limited beta program opened up in August. According to De Icaza, there were 600 people in the beta program.With 1.0 now available, the plan is to continue to evolve MonoTouch and add new features over time. Among the features for the MonoTouch 2.0 roadmap is support for Microsoft's Silverlight media framework. Novell has an effort known as Moonlight that provides an open source implementation."MonoTouch is not an open source effort, although the foundation with Mono is," De Icaza said.He added that many of the pieces that are necessary for MonoTouch are not open source. Among those pieces are all the API bindings to the Apple platform. Novell has been working on Mono since 2004 as an open source implementation of the .NET framework. The most recent release is Mono 2.4, which provides performance improvements."MonoTouch is proprietary and I don't feel guilty about that," De Icaza said. "Mono is open source, but on the iPhone we felt that it's a proprietary platform, a very locked down platform and we felt if you're targeting that platform, we might as well make it proprietary as well."

You can tell what version baseband you have by going to Settings->General->About->Modem Firmware. The unlock requires a jailbroken 3G iPhone.  It’ll be installable via Cydia, and so it doesn’t matter if you have a Mac or PC. Please refrain from updating your baseband, regardless of what version you’re at.  We’ll have complete directions on New Year’s Eve. We’ll stream a live demo of the unlock before Christmas (see the update at the end of this post).Softpedia doesn't condone jailbreaking / unlocking your iPhone / iPod touch or any other device. Using hacks may render your device unusable, or may considerably reduce the quality of your experience using the respective device. If you choose to download and install the PwnageTool, you do it at your own risk.The iPhone Dev Team, best known for its PwnageTool and QuickPwn hack software, has confirmed the completion of the iPhone 3G unlock. Those interested in jailbreaking their devices are advised not to upgrade to OS 2.2 using iTunes alone.“Over the Christmas break some of our members will be talking at the Chaos Computer Club’s 25C3 Congress,” a Dev-Team Blog post reads. “This talk will be a juicy technical talk relating to iPhone platform and our previous exploits.[...] We have been working hard on a few other things. The main one being the 3G unlock codenamed 'yellowsn0w.' This is now completed and is currently being packaged into a user-friendly application with the simplicity that you see in QuickPwn or BootNeuter.” Some facts for visitors of the blog are also listed. Readers are assumed to be OK with jailbreaks, hence the team's advice of refraining from updating the iPhone 3G's baseband. Read on for the details: It has been recently revealed that the newly-released Mac OS X 10.5.6 update keeps Macs from recognizing the iPhone in DFU mode , making it impossible to jailbreak / unlock it using PwnageTool or QuickPwn. Taking on the DFU Issues in OS X 10.5.6, the Dev Team explains that “Lots of users have been experiencing problems with the use of DFU mode after applying yesterday’s 10.5.6 system update. We believe this behavior is due to a kernel bug not a specific countermeasure by Apple.” The team offers some workarounds, but asks not to be held responsible should anything bad happen. It's probably best if you wait until New Year's Eve to jailbreak your device. Of course, it's probably even better to read the text in red and act accordingly.

Even though most don't expect the next iPhone to be called the "iPhone 5," it looks like Apple is still trying to secure rights to the name.According to Fusible, a blog that monitors domain name purchases, says Apple recently filed a dispute to gain ownership of iphone5.com.Right now, the site is a discussion board about the iPhone. It has no affiliation with Apple.If Apple wins the rights to iphone5.com, it's doubtful the company will use it. Fusible notes Apple owns many other domain names to protect its products.Now check out everything we know about the next iPhone >

Apple has found a new way to get people to agree to online tracking: withhold applications from them if they don't. This week Apple is launching a new iPhone. And with that comes a new operating system and the company's new advertising platform.According to Apple's new privacy policy, users can opt out if they don't want to be served targeted ads. But if they don't want to share their location information with the company, they also won't have access to new apps from the iTunes store.The launch of Apple's iAd advertising system this week comes with some new terms and conditions. Apple will be serving targeted advertising. Users can opt out of receiving such ads, but it won't be particularly easy. And the company thinks it would be cooler if people didn't opt out. According to the new T&Cs:"Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests."Apple customers who want to opt out of tracking have to use the above URL from an Apple device running iOS 4 to do so. And each of their devices using that operating system must be logged out individually.In addition, Apple is collecting "precise," "real-time geographic location" of its customers who use its new iOS software that runs on the new iPhone.Apple's wording assures customers that location data is “collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.” But it also doesn't give people a choice to opt out of location tracking. Users have to agree to the new terms and conditions before downloading new apps or any other data from the iTunes store.Meanwhile, the new T&Cs are light on details regarding what will happen with this location information. The company's privacy policy states:"To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work."Obviously, applications that rely on location will be among the “partners and licensees” who will access location data. But it would be nice to have details on what location-based services other than Find My iPhonewill utilize the data. Apple also insists that the data will be anonymous, but they are not divulging how long the data will be kept, which could irk privacy advocates.

Police have located and spoken to the man who found an iPhone prototype left behind by an Apple engineer at a San Francisco-area bar last month, according to media reports.Stephen Wagstaffe, a San Mateo County District Attorney spokesman, said police in Redwood City have spoken to the man but declined to disclose his name, according to reports by both CNET News and KCBS.In a recorded message on his work phone Wednesday, Wagstaffe said there was nothing new to report on the iPhone case and there was "nothing further to discuss concerning what has gone on so far."Wagstaffe also declined to say if the man is suspected of selling the prototype phone to Gizmodo, an online gadget guide site, the reports said.Last week, the New York Times reported Gizmodo paid the man $5,000 US for the prototype dubbed iPhone 4, 4G or HD in blogs, and posted photos and video of it on April 19 showing its new features, including a camera flash and a second camera for video chatting.Gizmodo editor Jason Chen said the phone had been left at a bar in Redwood City by one of Apple Inc.'s engineers.Chen arranged to return the iPhone when the company posted a letter by its lawyer asking for its return last week.Last Friday, a special computer-crime task force made up of different law enforcement agencies searched Chen's house and car in Fremont, Calif., and took computers, servers and accessories.The search warrant said the computer and other devices may have been used to commit a felony. Investigators also seized Chen's credit card bills and copies of his cheques.Chen's lawyers argue that California's shield law, which protects journalists from having to turn over anonymous sources or unpublished material to law enforcement during a search, should apply to him.

Electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn has denied earlier reports that thousands of workers went on strike on Friday at a plant that assembles Apple’s latest iPhone — reportedly causing production of the device to be “paralysed”. Today Foxconn said no such strike took place and claimed production of the iPhone 5 is on schedule, Reuters is reporting.Earlier reports had suggested 3,000 to 4,000 workers began striking at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou complex on Friday afternoon — with the disputes apparently triggered by “over-exacting quality controls” on iPhone 5 production, compounded by a lack of worker training to meet the new, higher standards. Demands that workers also work through a week-long national holiday also caused tensions to boil over into industrial action, according to reports.But Foxconn Technology Group sent Reuters a statement today denying there had been a strike. It said two brief and small disputes took place at the plant in question, several days earlier, but claimed these were “immediately addressed” and did not escalate into an “employee strike”. Additional staff were also provided for “the lines in question”, it added.“Any reports that there has been an employee strike are inaccurate,” Reuters quotes Foxconn in an emailed statement. Foxconn added that “there has been no workplace stoppage in that facility or any other Foxconn facility and production has continued on schedule”. Employees who worked over the national holiday did so voluntarily, it added.Also in the email, Foxconn said it received instructions from Apple to “strengthen quality inspections” for the iPhone 5 — “following multiple complaints from customers regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone”.We’ve asked Apple to confirm this claim and will update with any response.

Apple is selling the iPhone 3G on its Apple Store Web site in Hong Kong, promising the phones "can be activated with any wireless carrier."The Apple Store in Hong Kong is selling the 8GB and 16GB iPhone 3G models for HK$5,400 (US$695) and HK$6,200, respectively, with free shipping. The store advertises the compatibility of the phones with any carrier, saying, "Simply insert the SIM [subscriber identity module] from your current phone into iPhone 3G and connect to iTunes 8 to complete activation."On the Apple Store's main page for Hong Kong, the site says, "Buy directly from Apple. And choose your carrier.""Customer response to the iPhone 3G has been off the charts, and we are thrilled to offer our customers in Hong Kong another way to get their hands on this revolutionary device," an Apple spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to questions.The company did not comment on whether online iPhone 3G sales and activation will be extended to other markets.The iPhone 3G has been available in Hong Kong since July 11 through Hutchison Telecommunications. The cheapest monthly plan offered by the operator charges HK$2,938 for the 8GB version and HK$3,738 for the 16GB one, along with a two-year contract that costs HK$188 per month.Checks of the Apple Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Singapore, show the iPhone 3G is not available for sale online. Instead, the sites offer a link to a list of stores where the phone is on sale.

Apple's chief foe in the mobile sector and in the courtroom goes after the new iPhone, alleging that the device infringes on eight of its patents.Fresh off a courtroom victory against Apple today, Samsung filed another legal salvo against its chief foe.The Korean electronics giant submitted an amendment to a lawsuit originally filed in April against Apple, adding the iPhone 5 to a list of devices that includes the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the new iPad that Samsung accuses of infringing on several Samsung patents.Samsung reportedly threatened to sue Apple last month for patent infringement over its then rumored use of long-term evolution (LTE) connectivity in the next-generation smartphone. While the new iPhone's debut last month confirmed that Apple's new device featured access to the the speedier fourth-generation wireless networking -- for which Samsung holds numerous patents -- Samsung's latest lawsuit did not address the LTE patentsA Samsung representative told CNET this evening that the eight patents in question include six utility patents and two standard essential patents unrelated to its LTE patent portfolio (see filing below).Echoing previous statements made in the patent dispute, Samsung said, "we have little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights."CNET has contacted Apple for comment and will update this report when we learn more.In a bit of a one-two punch, Samsung added the iPhone 5 as a legal target after a federal judge issued an order dissolving a three-month-old ban on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the U.S. Samsung's once-flagship device was with stipulation that it could be reversed if Samsung was cleared of infringing on an Apple tablet design patent -- which happened during Apple's overwhelming patent victory over Samsung last month.Updated at 10:45 p.m. PT with more information from Samsung.

Smule has done it again. The company behind the ingenious lighter app that took the iPhone by storm a few months ago has launched Ocarina, a networked musical instrument that allows you to listen to songs being played around the world in real time. The app costs 99 cents, and you can grab it here.As an instrument Ocarina has been perfectly executed, and is much more suitable for the iPhone’s screen size than the virtual keyboards and guitars that litter the App Store. To play, you blow into the iPhone’s microphone while fingering notes using the 4 ‘holes’ on the ocarina. Smule says that the microphone can detect subtle variations in air flow, explaining that “unlike other iPhone audio apps, the sound is not pre-compiled but is generated by the notes, gestures and nuance of the individual performer”.And for the vast majority of the population that has no idea how to play an ocarina, the app has another awesome feature: you can listen in on the songs being played on any iPhone worldwide. After selecting the ‘globe’ view, the app presents you with a 3D world littered with a number of little dots presumably representing every active Ocarina. The app will automatically start playing one of these, highlighted by a series of green blobs rising from Earth, each of which corresponds to a note. If you don’t like what you’re listening to, you can hit the ‘next’ button to start playing a new song (you’ll probably be using this button often, as many of the people playing are awful).This is how an iPhone app should be done. As we pointed out in September, too few developers are leveraging the platform’s network effect to differentiate themselves, instead choosing to develop standalone apps that can be easily cloned. By being first to market with this app, Smule has safeguarded itself against the competition: even if another ocarina app comes along that is network compatible, Smule’s application will likely have the largest user base and will be very difficult to catch up with. And if Smule is smart, it’ll keep making these virtual instruments, allowing it to share the same network to create a worldwide orchestra that would be nearly impossible to replicate (and it sounds like it will – the company has developed an audio platform called ChucK that will likely be applied to other instruments).For another app that is trying to tap into the iPhone’s network effect, check out Chess With Friends, which we covered yesterday.

Update: The iPhone 2.0 software is now available. Update 2: Top apps by number of downloads is here.Apple’s iPhone App Store is now live, several hours ahead of its rumored 9 am PST launch. To access it, download iTunes 7.7 here. Once iTunes has upgraded, you can access the App Store here.You can “get apps” on iTunes now, but you’ll need the iPhone 2.0 software to actually use them on the iPhone, which isn’t yet available.There are 27 pages of applications currently available. We’ve updating our directory with the more interesting applications now. At first glance, there are very few non-English applications. Another interesting trend – a lot of books are listed as applications, most for $0.99 (I just bought Heart of Darkness, for example).According to Pinch Media, the App Store had 552 applications at launch. 135 of these apps are free, while the remaining 417 range in price from $0.99 to $69.99, with the vast majority ranging between $0.99 and $9.99.Some people are saying they can’t see the app store even after downloading v 7.7 of iTunes and clicking on the link above. Here’s a qik video I took of the store if you can’t access it yourself:Here are screen shots of the Facebook and MySpace App on iTunes, as well as one of the directory pages:

For those who don't know, Apple and AT&T removed an application that allowed your iPhone to interface with Google Voice. But, in removing GV Mobile from the app store, Apple has cut the application off from any future updates or bug fixes. The reality is that Apple took your money, and has interfered in your ability to get updates to a program you purchased.If you ask for a refund, Apple will happily refund your money, but, here's the stark reality of such a decision... The author, who received 70% of the purchase price when you bought the software, now has to refund 100% of the purchase price when you ask for a refund. In real numbers, The author made $2.09 on a $2.99 program. But, we has to give BACK $2.99--actually costing the author 90 cents for you to get a refund! Apple keeps the 90 cents profit no matter what.So, you want compensation, but you don't want to hurt the author? Here’s what I did.. This hurts APPLE and not the author! I called up apple corporate offices and told them that I want my money back as “compensation” — NOT as a refund. I was very specific that I did not want a refund on the app; that I wanted APPLE to cover my cost. They ended up crediting my account for 5-free song downloads, (Yes, it's a pathetic compensation, but, it’s something.. and it’s something that won’t hurt Sean, but DOES cost Apple money).I spoke to Robert Barger @ Apple Corporate care. You can reach him at 512-674-2500 x 40267. Give him a call and let him know how you feel about what happened.

While the Nokia Lumia 900 is the best Windows Phone currently available, and was formerly a gdgt Must-Have model, we've changed our stance on the phone for one simple reason: Microsoft has announced that current Windows Phone models won't be able to run the next version, Windows Phone 8. Based on this, we can't recommend locking yourself into a two-year contract for a phone that won't be able to take advantage of the latest software long before the end of that term. It's possible that, with deep discounts, you can get a good deal on the Lumia 900 (we've seen it on Amazon Wireless for about $50 with a two-year AT&T contract), and if you're content with the functionality available in Windows Phone 7 (the phone will be updated to at least WP 7.8), it could still be worth buying. But that doesn't make it a Must-Have smartphone.

Services like Ustream and Qik have long offered the promise of live streaming video from your mobile phone to the web — except if you had an iPhone. For those devices, that was only possible if you jailbroke your phone. Not anymore.The Ustream Live Broadcaster has just gone live in the App Store tonight and yes, it allows you to stream live video from the iPhone to the web. And yes, it even works over a 3G connection. And yes, it’s awesome.While one of the key features of the iPhone 3GS was video recording capabilities, that was limited to recordings that were captured on your device and could be uploaded to the web after they were done recording. With the Ustream Live Broadcaster, you can easily record videos right to the web, and allow others to watch them as they’re being recorded. These videos can also be archived so that people can watch them later, if they choose.Settings within the app also make it easy to automatically tweet out when you go live, as well as to do things like share the videos on Facebook and YouTube. The live broadcast can also send out your location, if you’re into that sort of thing. The app also allows for chatting with viewers, and yes/no polling.Ustream has long promised that it would be the first to allow for live video streaming on the iPhone, and it looks like they’ve finally come through — though almost a year after we first wrote about it. They’ve had an iPhone app out for a while, but it hasn’t had live capabilities until now. Qik has had a live-streaming app, but it was only an ad-hoc app, meaning it wasn’t available in the App Store.This Ustream app’s approval follows the approval of another live video streaming app, Knocking, after the developers emailed Steve Jobs personally about its rejection. But that app only does one-to-one streaming, this does one-to-many — full-on broadcast.Find the Ustream Live Broadcaster in the App Store here for free.

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

The CES 2010 did not officially start yet, but the Parrot AR.Drone already made it on my short list of CES 2010 coolest products. The Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter piloted with an iPhone or iPod touch that carries two cameras that deliver live video feed onto your iPhone. How bloody cool is that? (watch video below). Parrot is positioning the Parrot AR.Drone as a video game for the iPhone. It combines wireless, video and gaming technologies to allow real-world objects and conditions, like a tree or wind, to become a part of the video gaming experience.Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter that consists of a central cockpit surrounded by four propellers. One camera located underneath, connects to an Inertial Measurement Unit, which allows the AR.Drone to measure its speed and perform flawless stationary flight. Parrot Smart Piloting (PSP) technology compensates for wind and other environmental conditions during outside flights. For the first time, these technologies, used primarily for professional and military applications, have been adapted to the gaming universe. The second camera, at the front, broadcasts and streams to the iPhone or iPod touch screen, what the AR.Drone sees, as if you were sitting in the cockpit. This allows for the augmented reality gaming experience. The Parrot AR.Drone generates its own Wi-Fi network that simply connects to an iPhone or iPod touch and turns it into a true piloting station. I am not even sure if the U.S. Army has a better drone than this. Pricing has not been announced yet for Parrot AR.Drone. I hope it will be below $200. Parrot launches the iPhone Drone later this year. The company is more known for Bluetooth gear, but with the AR.Drone they could land a huge hit. I certainly want a AR.Drone when it is out for my iPhone. See also these hi-res photos. Game developers are invited to creating games for the Parrot AR.Drone on the open platform that Parrot provides for it. More details can be found on the Parrot AR.Drone site.

(CNN) -- Does a free case fix all the iPhone 4's problems?Not really, says Consumer Reports, the influential product watchdog.Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Friday announced that his company will give iPhone 4 owners free cases to address reception problems caused by the phone's external antenna, which is a metal band around the edge of the phone.Mike Gikas, senior editor for electronics and technology at Consumer Reports, said in an interview that such a patch is a good "first step." But it's still not enough for his group to recommend the phone to consumers."What we were hoping for was a concrete, this-is-it fix for the phone," Gikas said.Consumer Reports made headlines earlier this week for suggesting that iPhone 4 owners would get better phone reception if they put duct tape over the bottom left corner of the phone, where there was a "design flaw" in the antenna.In an effort to address widespread complaints, Apple said it will give a variety of iPhone 4 cases to consumers through September 30.Gikas said such a solution makes it difficult to review the phone, because everyone has a different case, and it's unclear if the solution is permanent; there's a chance the phone could still be recalled after September 30, or that a new version could be issued, he said."When we test a product we try to assume this product is just like all the others that came in boxes just like it," he said, "and we can't do that anymore [with the iPhone 4] because, with the case, this phone is different."During the press event in Cupertino, California, Jobs tried to spread the blame about reception issues across the smartphone industry as a whole.Gikas said that was a bit unfair."The human hand -- the body -- attenuates signal on all phones," he said. "But we haven't seen it happen to the degree that it's happened with the iPhone 4."Previously, Jobs had written an e-mail that said customers should hold the phone differently if they experienced poor reception.On Friday, Jobs skirted around saying there's a problem with the phone's hardware, Gikas said."The most important thing to remember is a problem was discovered with the phone and we can confirm it in a lab, and it was a significant problem," he said."And I don't think Apple fully admitted to it. They acknowledged it and they threw an interim solution at it. But everything spells fogginess about this thing."
