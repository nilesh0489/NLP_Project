Seventeen mobile phone manufacturers and operators have committed to develop standard for universal cell phone chargers by 2012.The initiative, led by the European mobile communications organization GSMA, seeks to adopt a universal connection and a common energy-efficient format that could result in an estimated 50 percent reduction in standby energy consumption and tens of thousands of tons of duplicate chargers.The group said phones would have a micro USB interface, currently used by some phones and by other devices such as digital cameras.Universal chargers would also make life easier for consumers, the GSMA said. Phones could be shipped cheaper, with no charger cord, since eventually most consumers would have one. And consumers would not be left with drawers of old chargers to sort through.Some of the industry’s biggest players are not included in the group, however, including Cupertino-based Apple Inc., whose popular iPhone uses a proprietary 30-pin cable; Sunnyvale-based Palm Inc.; and Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry smart phone tops the market.The companies that have joined the initiative are AT&T, KTF, LG, mobilkom austria, Motorola, Nokia, Orange, Qualcomm, Samsung3 Group, Sony Ericsson, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, T-Mobile and Vodafone.

The bizarre gathering, which morphed into a spirited Michael Jackson "Thriller" dance routine, marked the completion of its Windows Phone 7 software, and showed how badly Microsoft wants to resurrect itself in the viciously competitive phone market.The new software, which will be publicly unveiled on October 11 and expected on handsets in stores by November, is Microsoft's last chance, some analysts say, to catch up with Apple and Google Inc's Android smartphones, after squandering its strong market position in only a few years.A group of smartphone manufacturers including Samsung and HTC Corp are expected to roll out Microsoft-based phones for the holiday season.Whether they will be good enough to render the iPhone obsolete is the question."The product can't be an also-ran that just does everything that is already out in the marketplace," said Bryan Keane, an analyst for Alpine Mutual Funds, which holds Microsoft shares. "Right now, it isn't apparent that Windows 7 is better than anything that's out there, except that it might have a better tie-in to the actual Windows platform."By the admission of Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, the company "missed a generation" with Windows Mobile, its last phone operating system, which floundered while the iPhone and Android roared past with sumptuous touch screens and a host of new applications.Microsoft is now fourth in the fast-growing U.S. market for smartphone operating systems with a share of less than 12 percent, according to research firm comScore, behind BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd, Apple and Google.Microsoft's strange disappearance from the phone market, and its delayed response to the emergence of tablet devices like Apple's iPad, has been seen as a drag on Microsoft's shares, which are down 20 percent this year."The market is really fearful of their positioning in those two markets (phones and tablets)," said Ken Allen, Baltimore-based portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, which holds Microsoft shares. "Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock."Investors were not impressed with Microsoft's last attempt to launch a new phone, the Kin, which was dropped after fewer than three months on the market.Whether the new phones can make up for that error and lift concerns will depend on how the handsets measure up and how much the network carriers promote the phones.Prototypes of the new devices, which have been demonstrated by Microsoft employees over the past few months, look to be a huge improvement over the last version of Microsoft's phone software. They have a touch-screen interface resembling the company's Zune music player and movable 'tiles' that access various phone functions.But at first glance, they don't appear to offer radical new features that rivals lack.Launch phones are expected from Samsung, LG and HTC Corp, while AT&T Inc is expected to be the initial U.S. network provider, according to a person familiar with the launch plans. Microsoft and AT&T declined comment. None of the handset makers immediately replied to requests for details.All three of those phone makers already offer Android-based phones, while AT&T is currently the sole carrier for the iPhone, which means none has too much riding on the success of the new software, which could be a problem for Microsoft."We'll have to see how much vendor support (Microsoft) gets behind it -- that was partially what drove Android success," said Keane at Alpine. "But now, their problem is, 'We already have Android and the iPhone, do we need a third one?'."

It's always refreshing to hear the head of a major corporation cop to past mistakes -- particularly in front of a large crowd of on-lookers. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson admitted some misgivings about the way the carrier handled iPhone data, telling a crowd at the Milken Institute's Global Conference in Los Angeles, "My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat." Stephenson drove the point home by adding, "Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital."And, for the record, that certainly wasn't the only thing about the iPhone that kept the exec up at night. Stephenson again,You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model," he said. "Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you're using iMessage, you're not using one of our messaging services, right?No one ahead said it was easy being the chief.

A Scottish IP firm is suing Apple over the smooth zooming and scrolling featured on the iPhone.Glasgow-based patent licenser Picsel Technologies says the Cupertino iDevice maker illegally uses display technologies it developed. The firm sued Apple on Friday in Delaware District Court.Picsel claims Apple infringes on its US patent 7,009,626, titled "Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing."The patent describes using an approximate, intermediary rendering of what's displayed on a device while scrolling, zooming, or during other major screen transitions.For example, if a user zooms into a particular object on a device's web browser, the transition is done by showing an approximation of what the final display will look like using scaled data from the page before the zoom.Picsel claims it has spent millions of dollars developing the technology for the patent, which the USPTO approved on March 7, 2006.The company also alleges that Apple knowingly and deliberately infringes on patent '626 with devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, although the initial complaint doesn't provide evidence for this claim.Picsel says the IP has been baked into more than 200 million devices worldwide. Its website lists companies like Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, Panasonic, Palm, HP, Motorola, and Nokia as licensing partners.It appears many of the technologies the firm makes are produced in-house - not collected from other inventors.The complaint asks for a block on allegedly infringing Apple products, unspecified damages, that patent damages be increased to three times the amount awarded, and attorneys fees.A copy of the lawsuit is available here. ®

Several versions of Apple's iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have potentially serious security problems, a German government agency said in an official warning Wednesday.Apple's iOS operating system has "two critical weak points for which no patch exists," the Federal Office for Information Security said.Opening a manipulated website or a PDF file could allow criminals to spy on passwords, planners, photos, text messages, e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations, the agency said in a statement."This allows potential attackers access to the complete system, including administrator rights," it added, urging users not to open PDF files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until Apple Inc. publishes a software update.A spokesman for Apple in Germany, Georg Albrecht, told The Associated Press that the company is looking into the matter."We know these reports and are investigating them," he said, refusing to elaborate.Although no attacks have been observed yet they were likely to appear soon, the German agency said."It has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks," it said, noting that the devices' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world.The warning relates to iPhones using iOS versions 3.1.2-4.0.1., iPads using iOS 3.2-3.2.1 and iPods Touch using iOS 3.1.2.-4.0.The agency said it was possible but not clear whether older iOS or iPhone OS versions could also be affected.The federal agency, based in Bonn, said it was in contact with Apple on the issue.

So I have my Macbook (2008, white, running 10.5.8) set to lock when the lid is shut, prompting me for a password when the computer opens/wakes up. Great. No problem. But occasionally I'll plug my iPhone (3G) into the USB port while the lid is shut to charge overnight. When the phone is plugged in, the computer immediately wakes up - the apple logo glows and the phone begins charging. After a few moments, the light turns off, the comp falls back asleep, and the phone continues charging.Risk I noticed (and repeated to test) this morning.Can any of you test this to see if this is more widespread than a fluke in Austin, TX?

I updated my iPhone 4S earlier today (using the OTA method), and I discovered a nasty bug. My iPhone could no longer remember the names of any of my contacts! I opened up the contacts app on my phone and discovered that all of entries were still there but if I got a text or a call my iPhone would have a sudden bout of amnesia and forget the contacts name.It’s even more bizarre when you’re trying to create a new text. In the example above I texted Erin Hontz. After I selected her as the contact, I wrote my message and hit send. In the message pane (pictured on the right) it would forget my contact’s name and just show the number.I mentioned this on Twitter and many of my followers had similar experiences.• Use the Delta Update (The OTA version) • Be on an iPhone 4S (I haven’t had reports with the 4) • Be On VerizonDisabling (and re-enabling) iCloud contacts did not solve the issue.Have you had any issues upgrading to iOS 5.0.1?This method fixed my incoming calls but not incoming text messages. Your milage may vary. via TSF reader James Foster1) Open the Phone and dial *228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number. 2) When the system answer press 1 for “Program or activate your phone” 3) Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, “Settings updated.” 4) Open the Task Manager (double click the home button) and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications 5) Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe) 6) Open the Message App to verify the fix.If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.

Let’s step into a time machine and travel through the mists of chronos to an ancient yesteryear. It was a different era, Britney Spears shaved her head, Boris Yeltsin died, and people learned how to print images on toast from the comfort of their own workshops. Oh, and a lil’ thing called an iPhone came out. The year was 2007, and Verizon and Sprint were so scared that they issued these ridiculous sheets to their frontline reps with talking points for discouraging people from buying an iPhone:“Touch screen: It sounds cool, but if you’re a heavy text or email user, it could be challenging not being able to feel the keys as you press them. And how are you going to type without looking with a keyboard you can’t even feel.” “Sorry, iPhone can’t send picture or video message — only e-mail. No over-the-air downloads. You have to connect to a PC to load music.” “Wi-Fi is not a mobile technology. You have to be in a fixed location to use it — and that’s if you know where to find it. And some Wi-Fi hotspots make you pay to use them. There’re also those pesky concerns about security of Wi-Fi.”“The iPhone is an Apple product and has some nice features. It also has a nice price. Do you really need all those features in one device?” “Are you sure 4G or 8G is enough storage for you? To give you a comparison, most iPods/MP3 players hold 40 to 60Gigs or more.” “Using the iPhone on the GSM/EDGE network may be like having a really powerful computer on dial up.”Ok, that last one turned out to be true.

In an effort to get around Apple's ban on rival browsers for its iPhone, Mozilla plans to offer a Firefox application that will give users access to their browser bookmarks and history. The app will also let users open tabs from their most recent Firefox sessions.The Firefox Home app is a spin-off of the bookmark and tab synchronization technology Mozilla currently offers as an add-on for the Firefox desktop browser. Mozilla will submit the free application to the App Store within the next three weeks. Sadly, Mozilla has no way to know when or if the app will be approved and available to users, so it's hard to say when we'll be able to get our hands on this app.Firefox Home Coming Soon to the iPhoneWe have been working on an application for the iPhone based on the Firefox Sync (formerly Weave Sync) technology. The app is called Firefox Home, and it gives iPhone users instant access to their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks and the set of tabs from their most recent browser session. What’s more, it provides Firefox “Awesome Bar” capability that enables people to get to their favorite web sites with minimal typing.Firefox Home provides an amazing “get up and go” experience. It’s encrypted end-to-end. It’s your home on the Web, wherever you are. And, of course, it’s free.Firefox Home for iPhone is part of a broader Mozilla effort to provide a more personal Web experience with more user control. For devices or platforms where we’re unable to provide the “full” Firefox browser (either technically or due to policy), we aim to provide users with “on the go” instant access to their personal Firefox history, bookmarks and open tabs on their iPhones, giving them another reason to keep loving Firefox on their desktops.Why is this useful?

Apple could be just days away from becoming the subject of an unpleasant antitrust inquiry into a recent decision to restrict software development on the iPhone and iPad. Nevermind Apple’s moral policing which always ignites the heated debate among our readers, this is a much more serious issue than app rejections, the one with potentially far-reaching implications for the Californian firm.From Apple’s perspective, they are entitled to define user experience on the iPhone platform which is – mind you – neither open-sourced nor open in the Android sense. Apple’s unmatched ability to create gadgets that “just work” stems from their tight control of the entire widget, including software, hardware, apps, services, and user interfaces. Take this control away from Apple and you have just another gadget vendor that builds dull products.The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is thinking different about such a closed ecosystem. According to New York Post, Apple could be “in the eye of regulatory storm” and might even face an antitrust probe over its lock out on iPad and iPhone. A source “familiar with the matter” told the publication that:The inquiry could pave the way for a fully-fledged investigation if the agencies conclude that Apple’s controversial decision to prohibit app development does in fact stifle competition. According to Steve Jobs’ widely publicized rambling titled “Thoughts on Flash,” Apple sees third party cross-development tools as a big no-no because they lead to “sub-standard apps and hinder the enhancement and progress” of the platform. It’s a fight for developers’ resources because programmers must choose between “developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously,” New York Post noted.Developers with limited budgets are hurt the most because their focus on iPhone inevitably comes at the expense of other platforms. Jobs has a point, too, because cross-development tools do enable only the lowest common denominator set of features, as he summed it up nicely:If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers. This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor’s platforms.Apple’s our-way-or-the-highway approach makes sense from their way of doing things.  By the way, Adobe’s shares dipped two percent the day Apple published that piece. We’ll find out soon if the DoJ and FTC can establish the case against Apple, but we can help but wonder who’s next?Probe Microsoft because Windows doesn’t run Linux apps? Go after Sony because it only sells Sony Pictures movies on Playstation Network? Bring movie studios to justice because we aren’t allowed to watch FairPlay-DRM’d iTunes movies on non-Apple devices? Hit Adobe because its Flash is killing the prospect of open videos? Meet us in comments.Read more at New York Post

Apple on Monday rested its case that Samsung ripped off the design of the iPhone and iPad while building its own mobile products. Meanwhile, three of the Samsung phones that Apple labeled as infringing were tossed from the trial.It was a minor victory for Samsung. The Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S i9000, and Galaxy S II i9100 were thrown out of the case by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh after questions about whether the phones were even sold in the US. The devices were dropped from the case because they are “world phones that could be purchased in the US., but that weren't sold by Samsung's telecommunications and electronics divisions in the US,” according to CNET.All Things D points out, however, that the ruling does not affect the US-specific versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S and Galaxy SII phones, which are among roughly 20 devices Apple has identified as infringing its intellectual property. Moreover, the three phones were essentially worthless in Apple's case from a financial perspective. Apple's damages report assigned the three phones a worth of $0, the only phones in the case with such a distinction.Samsung tried to get a larger victory today, asking for a Judgment as a Matter of Law that Apple hasn’t proven its case, and that no reasonable jury could possibly side with Apple. Koh rejected Samsung’s request, meaning the case will, as expected, move forward to the next phase. Earlier on Monday, Apple’s expert witness on financial matters testified regarding the damages Apple is seeking, a number that recently grew from $2.5 billion to $2.88 billion.With Apple resting its case, Samsung was able to start its defense late this afternoon. Samsung's first witness was Benjamin Bederson, chief scientist and co-founder of a mobile company called Zumobi. Bederson is testifying on Samsung's behalf because he helped create a user interface for mobile touchscreen devices called LaunchTile, which was apparently used in conjunction with Microsoft's Pocket PC software and the HP iPAQ device starting in November 2004. Samsung believes LaunchTile should count as prior art, making some of Apple's patents invalid because the technology already existed, according to a Forbes liveblog of the trial. After Bederson, one of the people behind a 2001 touchscreen tabletop computer called DiamondTouch also testified on the prior art issue.We’ll hear much more about why Samsung doesn't think it infringed Apple’s patents as the week goes on. Judge Koh is reportedly aiming to move to closing arguments by Tuesday of next week before handing the case off to the jury.

Although previous versions of Windows Mobile have long supported a clipboard to move content around, the Windows Phone 7 Series devices due out this year won't have that ability.LAS VEGAS--The new Windows Phones have a lot of things that prior versions of Windows Mobile haven't had, most notably a cool factor.But one thing that the 7 Series devices won't have--at least not this year's crop--is the ability to broadly copy and paste items. As earlier noted by Engadget, Microsoft confirmed on Tuesday that developers shouldn't expect to have access to a clipboard to allow users to copy and paste. Nor will Microsoft's own Office applications have copy and paste. That's despite the fact that it has been a staple of past versions of Windows Mobile for as long as I can recall."We don't enable copy and paste and we do that very intentionally," Windows Phone executive Todd Brix said in an interview.Brix said many times when a user copies something on a phone, what they really are looking to do is take a specific action, such as calling a phone number or e-mailing an address. For those specific tasks, Microsoft has what it calls "smart linking," which lets a user double click on a phone number and either call it or add it to the phone book. For an address, one can get a map without having to copy and paste the address."It's actually an intentional design decision," he said. "We try to anticipate what the user wants so copy and paste isn't necessary."But, particularly for a device that is going to include Word and other mobile Office applications, the concept of intelligent links doesn't seem sufficient. The BlackBerry for example, offers both intelligent links and a copy-and-paste system, which seems to me to be ideal.Brix insists that most users won't miss copy and paste and said that it was a matter of focus; Microsoft said it wanted to really do well the tasks that 80 percent of users wanted."We tried to focus on what the core use cases were," Brix said. "Certainly there will be some people that wont be happy with some of those decisions."If this feels like deja vu, a similar limitation hampered the initial iPhone, with Apple later going back and adding the feature.As my colleague Jessica Dolcourt noted recently, it's not like users don't want copy and paste. We just take it for granted unless some one boldy chooses to omit it.With the 7 Series taking so many cues from the iPhone, I'm surprised Microsoft didn't learn that lesson.

Its seems like the financial crisis over the world really has not affected to the Austrian jeweler Peter Aloisson,because he created a record for himself by designing the world’s most expensive phone Apple iPhone 3G Kings Button.The Apple iPhone 3G Kings Button’s main operating button is integrated with high quality 6.6 carat diamonds, this impression itself of the phone is very attractive. This exquisite phone is made of solid 18-carat yellow gold, white gold and rose gold. It e flaunts a white gold line encrusted with a total of 138 brilliant cut diamonds of the best quality.The new Apple iPhone 3G ‘Kings Button’ is the most luxurious phone to date. The phone is definitely for those who dare to defy the current credit crunch.

We knew this day would eventually come, but somehow we're still misting up a little -- Linux has been ported to the iPhone and iPod touch. Dev Team member planetbeing is the mastermind in charge of bringing everyone's favorite open-source OS to Apple's handhelds, and while it's a little rough around the edges (read: no touchscreen drivers, sound, or WiFi / cell radio support), it's definitely the first step on the road to hacking nirvana. The team is hard at work, and it even sounds like they're thinking about porting Android in the near future (!), so hit the read link to try it out and lend a hand if you can -- or just head on past the break for a quick vid of the port in all its text-scrolling glory.[Via iphone-dev.org ; thanks to everyone who sent this in]

Ever wanted to unlock your iPhone simply by having it look at you and recognize who you are? A jailbreak mod called RecognizeMe will be hitting Cydia soon and promises to bring biometric facial recognition security to the iPhone 4. The mod will allow you to unlock your iPhone by scanning your facial features with the front-facing camera and verifying who you are before giving you access.The tweak offers settings for dialing up the level of security (facial matching), which we're assuming requires a bit more processing time, but the app definitely appears to deliver on its promise of facial recognition security for the iPhone 4. The mod looks a little slow at the moment, but hopefully the developers are able to optimize the code before an official release.Check out the video after the jump, and let us know what you think in the comments!

XBMC is a free media player that began life on the Xbox but has since grown to be a multi-platform solution. The XBMC software, which already runs on the previous Mac OS X-based, Intel x86 Apple TV, has now been released to work on the ARM Architecture A4 chip used in the new iOS version, offering the ability to install apps and play content formats Apple doesn't natively support on its $99 box, according to AppleInsider. Furthermore it will be able to be played on the iPad and iPhone.With regard to jailbreaking and Apple TV, MacRumors.com says:The software is not available through the App Store, and requires a jailbroken Apple TV or iOS device. While jailbreaking has been a known way to load third party apps onto the iPad and iPhone, it's not been a very common procedure for the Apple TV. Due to similarities of the underlying iOS firmware on the new Apple TV, it's been widely expected that these unauthorized apps would become available for the device. Apple presently offers no authorized way to install apps on the Apple TV.

Nokia's Lumia 920 packs the industry's best image stabilization -- there's no questioning that -- thanks to a camera module that pairs both sensor and lens-based optical IS. The iPhone 5 also offers a notable improvement over its Apple-made predecessor on the video front, but considering that its stabilization is of the digital variety, we wouldn't expect it to top Nokia's new flagship. We had an opportunity to test both smartphones in a head-to-head demo at Nokia's research and development facility in Tampere, Finland, about two hours north of the company's Espoo headquarters. In fact, we're told that this is the very first such comparison shoot in the world, considering that the iPhone made it to market just last week and the only opportunity to shoot with a Lumia 920 is currently in the European country where the device was born.As expected, the Nokia phone was able to capture far smoother video than what we snapped with the iPhone, with both devices secured side-by-side in a homemade foam holster. Unlike our handheld interview shoot earlier today, we pushed the limits a bit further this time, running through Nokia's parking lot and turning every which way as well. It's important to note that the Lumia 920 we used was a prototype, but its performance was still quite solid. You'll find the side-by-side video just past the break -- the Lumia 920 is on the left, with the iPhone clip on the right.Update: We also had an opportunity to test the Samsung Galaxy S III (just below) and the HTC One X (following) against the Lumia 920. Both smartphones lack OIS, so we weren't surprised to see poor stabilization performance. Check out the videos for the head-to-head.

Free image-browsing app is intended to show what is possible on the mobile platform, but where is the Windows Mobile version?Is it possible some at Microsoft find the iPhone a more attractive platform than the software giant's own Windows Mobile?Engineers in the company's Live Labs have released the company's first application for Apple's popular smartphone--even before making it available on Microsoft's own mobile platform. Seadragon Mobile, which was added to Apple's App Store on Saturday, is a free image-browsing app that allows users to quickly "deep zoom" images while online and is intended to demonstrate what is possible with a mobile platform.Seadragon is the backbone for Microsoft's Photosynth, which allows users to take a grouping of photographs and stitch them together into a faux 3D environment.Other iPhone apps are reportedly in development in Redmond; Microsoft's Tellme unit was expected to release the company's first iPhone app in the form of a voice-activated search for a variety of phones, including iPhone and BlackBerry. A Microsoft representative told my colleague Ina Fried in September that a public version of that program would likely be released in a few months.So where's the Windows Mobile version of Seadragon?"The iPhone is the most widely distributed phone with a (graphics processing unit)," Alex Daley, group product manager for Microsoft Live Labs, told TechFlash. "Most phones out today don't have accelerated graphics in them. The iPhone does and so it enabled us to do something that has been previously difficult to do."

Alright folks, this is the single biggest news in iPhone hacking ever since the jailbreak. iPhone hacker and Dev-Team member Planetbeing apparently just managed to port Google’s Android Mobile OS to the iPhone.I repeat, he took the Android OS, the system that runs on the Android phones, and installed it on an iPhone. I believe this is the very first time someone managed to install a non-Apple OS on the iPhone and the implications of this are absolutely huge.It’s still in alpha version for now, but with some improvements, this would allow anybody to use both iPhone and Android OS on their iPhone. Just like you can do Bootcamp on your Mac to access PC apps, you’ll be able to go on Android to try all these apps that don’t exist, or were not allowed on the iPhone. Imagine for a second that Adobe manages to puts flash on there, well, you’ll get to have it too.Check it out, it’s just sick:To get more late breaking news as it happens, download the AppAdvice iPhone/iPad app!

Porissa sattui maanantaina aamulla jotain varsin kummallista matkapuhelimen kanssa. Nuori mies sai epämukavan kuuman herätyksen maanantaihin. - Aamusta heräilin ja piti mennä yhdeksäksi töihin, mutta meninkin kahdeksaksi isäni kyydillä, aloittaa Helminen. Perillä työpaikan pihalla nuori mies laittoi autossa iPhonen takataskuunsa ja nousi autosta ulos maanantaisesta aamuherätyksestä vielä hieman väsyneenä. Pian kuitenkin takataskussa alkoi tapahtua kummia. - Kävelin autosta ulos kaksi metriä, kun alkoi kuulua outoa suhinaa. Kohta paikat kuumenivat. - Ihmettelin sitä suhinaa ja yhtäkkiä rupesi polttamaan. Katsoin taaksepäin ja savua tuli aivan järkyttävästi. En yhtään osannut ajatella, että se olisi puhelin! Lopulta nuori mies nappaa kännykän takataskusta ja heittää maahan. - Puhelin oli ihan liekeissä ja savusi oikein kunnolla. Housutkin olivat vähän liekeissä. Kyllä siinä kädet tärisivät! Pian isä Juho Helminenkin huomasi, että jotain kummaa tapahtui. Koko tapahtumaketjun tallensi firman valvontakamera. - Siinä se ihan selkeästi näkyy, että poika kävelee autosta vähän maanantaiaamun tyyliin, ja yhtäkkiä savua tulee aivan kamalasti, isä sanoo. - Housuihin paloi kiinni sulaa muovia ja kännykkä paloi huonoon kuntoon, poika kertoo. - Jos olisin mennyt yhdeksäksi, kuten aluksi pitikin, niin kännykkähän olisi syttynyt kotona. Siinä olisi sänky syttynyt palamaan ja olisi voinut käydä pahemminkin. Pidän puhelinta aina sängyssä ja olen tässä miettinyt, mitä kaikkea olisi voinut tapahtua. Isä on ollut yhteydessä Appleen. - Ensin yhdistettiin Yhdysvaltoihin, sitten Ruotsiin ja sitten jollekin suomea puhuvalle, katsotaan nyt miten tämä tästä. Nuori on nyt ilman puhelinta ja uusi pitäisi hankkia. iPhone ei ole joutunut mustalle listalle. - Tässä on nyt selvittelyä, että mitä Apple ja vakuutus tähän sanoo. Eiköjän tässä nyt kuitenkin ole jonkinlaisesta yksittäistapauksesta kyse, poika sanoo. iPhone on ostettu maaliskuun 22. päivä ja se toimi ennen tätä moitteettomasti.

The new iPhone 3G and the iPhone 2.0 software update can best be described as the most successful failure I can remember. Apple has sold an astounding number of phones and applications, and yet is failing in so many different ways:And yet, Apple can chalk this release up as yet another major success. I love my iPhone and other Apple products, but so far my expectations are not being met with the iPhone 2.0 software and the 3G iPhone experience. I fully understand why existing iPhone users are not as excited as new buyers.

Samsung (005930) isn’t even waiting for Apple (AAPL) to launch the iPhone 5 before taking aim at the new smartphone in a new run of attack ads. The first such advertisement appeared in newspapers on Sunday, comparing a sampling of iPhone 5 specs to a significantly larger list of Galaxy S III features. Under the heading “It doesn’t take a genius,” Samsung’s aim is to communicate that its flagship Android smartphone outclasses the iPhone 5 in a number of key areas including display size and quality, RAM, available storage and battery life. Apple’s iPhone 5 launches this coming Friday at 8:00 a.m. local time and the Samsung Galaxy S III went on sale in the U.S. in early July. Samsung’s full ad can be seen below.

The launch of Apple’s latest smartphone has come and gone, sending millions of users home with the latest in mobile tech from Apple. Everything about the iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, and smaller, right down to the SIM card.For the second time since the original iPhone, Apple has opted for a smaller SIM to go in their phone. Micro-SIM cards are now the standard for many carriers, just in time for Apple to adopt the smaller nano-SIM for their devices. This means that every iPhone 5 user, even the ones that are moving from the iPhone 4S, need to move to a new SIM card and throw their old ones away. On an individual scale this is no big deal, but what does such a small change mean on a global scale?Within the first day of pre-orders, Apple had sold more than two million iPhone 5 handsets. This doesn’t include any of the hordes of people that waited outside of an Apple Store on the release day for the phone (which took that figure up to 5 million). This launch was the biggest one Apple has ever had, and the largest pre-order event any smartphone has ever had. More than five million people, most of whom already had a smartphone, now need a new SIM card.Despite the nano-SIM being much smaller than previous cards, the plastic tray that every user is given is the exact same size. This credit card sized piece of plastic has a small rectangle notched out where you punch through and pop out your nano-SIM. The previous SIM and the plastic holder for the new SIM are then tossed in the garbage.The previous SIM and the casing to the new SIM together will weigh about 5.6 grams. If you look at the five million users that managed to secure an iPhone 5 already, that is roughly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated just by forcing every user to replace their SIM card. Nearly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated in a single weekend, and the knowledge that if any of those users move away from the iPhone 5 to another device any time soon, that user will need to change SIM cards all over again.Apple maintains a page on their own website that describes all of the environmental practices, including the things they have done to improve their packaging and manufacturing process along the way. That page has not yet been updated to the iPhone 5, and so does not include any information on what Apple feels the footprint of their latest smartphone is.If you are someone who has just picked up the iPhone 5 and changed SIM, please recyle the plastic.

An Apple logo is seen at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California June 11, 2012.The ruling came from Judge Richard Posner in Chicago federal court. He dismissed the litigation between Apple and Motorola Mobility with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled.The ruling is a blow for Apple, which had hoped a decisive ruling against Motorola would help it gain an upper hand in the smartphone market against Android."Apple is complaining that Motorola's phones as a whole ripped off the iPhone as a whole," Posner wrote. "But Motorola's desire to sell products that compete with the iPhone is a separate harm -— and a perfectly legal one -— from any harm caused by patent infringement."Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment on the ruling. Motorola Mobility spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said the company was pleased that Posner dismissed Apple's case.Both parties have the option to appeal Posner's ruling.Motorola sued Apple in October 2010, a move that was widely seen as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent Apple lawsuit. Apple filed its own claims against Motorola the same month.Posner issued a series of pre-trial rulings that eliminated nearly all of Motorola's patent claims against Apple from the prospective trial, while maintaining more of Apple's claims against Motorola. That meant Apple had more to gain in the trial, which had been set to start last week.However, Posner canceled the trial earlier this month.Apple had sought an injunction barring the sale of Motorola products using Apple's patented technology. But in Friday's ruling, Posner wrote that neither party is entitled to an injunction.Since Motorola could design around the minor technological features covered by Apple's patents, an injunction would be an inappropriate windfall for Apple, Posner wrote.Posner also said that Apple had not clearly demonstrated that Motorola phones caused a loss of consumer goodwill significant enough for an injunction."To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture," Posner wrote.In a bright spot for the iPhone maker, Posner also ruled that Motorola could not seek an injunction based on the one patent in the case that it was still asserting against Apple.Motorola had pledged to license that patent - which covers an aspect of wireless communication - on fair and reasonable terms to other companies in exchange for having the technology adopted as an industry standard."How could it be permitted to enjoin Apple from using an invention that it contends Apple must use if it wants to make a cell phone," Posner wrote.At a hearing earlier this week, Apple had argued that it would be satisfied with an injunction forcing Motorola to remove Apple's patented features within three months. But Posner found that proposal unworkable, in part because of the hardship in administering such an order."Because of the potential costs to Motorola and the federal judiciary I could not responsibly order injunctive relief in favor of Apple," he wrote in his ruling.The case is Apple Inc. and NeXT Software Inc. V. Motorola Inc. and Motorola Mobility Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, no. 11-08540.(Reporting by Dan Levine in Oakland, California and Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and Jeremy Laurence)

Apple announced an iPhone event today where they'll be giving "a sneak peek at the iPhone OS 3.0 software."Gizmodo suggests this might coincide with the unveiling of a rumored touchscreen tablet based on the iPhone, but we'll see for sure on March 17th. Got a feature you'd love to see added to iPhone 3.0 (*cough, copy and paste, cough*)? Let's hear about it in the comments. [Gizmodo]

The new iPhone 4 uses Apple's FaceTime video calling application to allow users to see each while on the phone. The resolution and streaming seems to be top notch, and using Face Time doesn't count as billable minutes. But STILL, somehow, there are some drawbacks.Face Time uses Wi-Fi so you have to be connected to a network in order to use it.Also Face Time only works from one iPhone 4 to another. Users that want video calling with non-iPhone 4 users will be forced to either find other applications or buy all their friends new iPhones.(Negative)BONUS: Even if you COULD get onto this easily and anywhere you want, if you weren't near a charger your conversation probably wouldn't last very long anyway, as apparently the battery on the iPhone 4, even though it's supposedly more powerful by about 40%, really isn't that much better than the one on the 3GS.FaceTime IS great technology, though, and really where phones have been moving towards for the last few years. There's nothing like actually SEEING the people you're speaking for a whole 13 minutes before your battery gives out in the middle of the day.

Google has denied the latest rumors that the search giant will bring free turn-by-turn GPS navigation on the Apple iPhone, although the features could come in the future to other (unspecified) mobile platforms.Reports surfaced on Thursday quoting a Google executive speaking about plans to bring free turn-by-turn navigation to other mobile platforms, including the iPhone, during a London press conference launching Maps Navigation for Android phones in the U.K.."We did not say we would bring it to iPhone, we said to date we've had it on Android and that in the future it may come to other platforms but did not confIn Android 2.0, Google introduced Maps Navigation, which includes 3D maps, turn-by-turn voice guidance, and automatic rerouting -- all at no cost for the user. Available initially only in the U.S., the software does not store the maps on your phone, but uses the Internet connection to display routes.However, Google clarified on Thursday a few unknowns about its free navigation software for Android. Maps Navigation pre-caches an entire route, and it needs a data connection only when it calculates the directions. So, while driving to your destination, if you lose the connection temporarily, the route progress will still be displayed as long as you stay on the initial route.Free turn-by-turn navigation for mobile phones is getting increasingly popular with customers, to the detriment of traditional GPS device makerslike TomTomor Garmin. Next to Google's Maps Navigation, now available in both U.S. and U.K., Nokia introduced in January its own free GPS software for several of its devices, and by now has been downloaded more than 10 million times.

Oh, you knew this was going to happen. Samsung is not taking the release of the iPhone 5 lying down. A new ad declares Apple's phone isn't genius.I don't think they've kissed and made up yet.When one party embarrasses another so badly -- and in public -- you don't expect the hurt one to just take it, do you?And so Samsung is greeting the arrival of the iPhone 5 with an ad that will run tomorrow in certain national and local newspapers (how modern). It is not a flattering ad. It suggests that the iPhone 5 isn't even good enough to be, well, a copy of the Galaxy S3.Clearly, it's been hastily put together, but its headline -- "It doesn't take a genius" -- rather prepares you for what follows.Yes, it's a list of all the fine, rational reasons why the Galaxy S3 is vintage port compared to the iPhone 5's wine-in-a-box.Oh, the Galaxy S3 is full of things the iPhone doesn't have: Palm Swipe Capture, Shake to Update, oh, and NFC -- to name but three.And though there's no doubt that the S3 is a fine phone -- especially for those with hands handed down by gorillas -- there is one small element that Samsung might be overlooking.People don't buy the iPhone for all the features. They buy it for all those quirky, irrational, emotional, maddening reasons that make people's eyes glaze over and their minds work like a blancmange clock.Samsung's biggest problem isn't that its phone doesn't have some fine rational attributes. It's that the brand hasn't captured hearts.There are no lists nor self-help books that can tell you how to do that. That does, sometimes, take a little genius.

Palm wasn’t kidding around when they said they wanted more PDK apps to be submitted. As such, the good folks at Mobile 1UP submitted their entire catalog of mobile games, including the complete GW series, for consideration. And now you too can play their game on your Pre. That, and the Twitter app that beta testers have been raving about has finally arrived - that's right, TweetMe is here, and it’s got some introductory pricing action going to boot. Head on past the break to see it all happen in listacular form.

DALLAS (AP) — An iPhone application helped a Dallas man, while visiting relatives hundreds of miles away in suburban Hartford, Conn., watch as two burglars broke into his home.Vincent Hunter told WFAA-TV that he called 911 at the same time his home security system also contacted authorities.Hunter says "we could see it unfolding."Hunter says an iCam app, which he bought for less than $5, sent him a text message Friday afternoon alerting him that motion detectors sensed movement in his supposedly empty residence.

Samsung has recently been at the courts against Apple in the US. Unfortunately, as we all know, Apple has had one major win against Samsung – resulting in a $1.05 billion fine for the South Korean tech giant.So, when Apple went on to announce (and soon release) the iPhone 5, Samsung wasn’t going to take this lying down. Samsung have made a quite hilarious poster which displays the similarities and differences of the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III.It’s probably worth mentioning too that we don’t know the exact differences between the A6 and Exynos 4 chips found inside – but we do know that the Galaxy S III’s Exynos is quite a powerful chip set. Most of the differences come in the form of design and software additions, but it’s good to see that the iPhone 5 is on-par (or slightly worse off) then a device that was launched 3 months ago. Feast your eyes on this:

iUsers with unmeddled tech must wait for Apple patchThe latest jailbreak for iPhones, published on Wednesday, exploits a zero-day bug in iOS that only users of jailbroken devices will be able to fix, security experts warn.Version 3 of jailbreakme.com, which also works on iPad fondleslabs, takes advantage of a PDF-related vulnerability in iOS. Users of jailbroken devices can use PDF Patcher 2 to guard against the underlying flaw while users of regular devices will have to wait for a patch from Apple. Jailbroken devices allow the installing of apps besides those approved by the official Apple App Store."It's as serious as last time when jailbreakme.com was using a zeroday," notes Mikko Hyponnen of Finnish security firm F-Secure. "Last time nothing bad happened, as Apple patched fast."Apple does not allow anti-virus software to be listed in the official iPhone AppStore, so there's no protection via this route until a patch for the underlying vulnerability is published by Apple.The "temporary" vulnerability of unaltered iPhones and fondleslabs illustrates one security shortfall of the locked-down walled-garden approach practised by Apple. The more laissez-faire approach followed by Google with Android has seen an upswing in malicious code targeted against Droid phones, however. iPhone malware remains even rarer than the low levels of Droid Trojans in circulation but, even so, the potential for badness is still there. ®

Like us on Facebook.com/TrendingNow and follow Trending Now on Twitter: @Knowlesitall and @YahooTrending.Just the other day, we were hearing about Samsung getting in legal trouble over patent violations with Apple. A federal court decision ruled that Samsung owes Apple more than $1 billion in restitution. Samsung plans to appeal the decision, saying it never attempted to steal anything from Apple's iPhone.Next week, on September 12, Apple is expected to introduce its highly anticipated iPhone 5, but the company may find itself on the receiving end of a patent-infringement battle. Chinese tech company Goophone is launching the Goophone I5, which looks suspiciously like an iPhone in the company's video on YouTube.In recent months, tech blogs all over the world have released leaked photos and videos of what is rumored to be Apple's iPhone 5. The pictures show what appears to be a longer, thinner, but altogether similar version of previous models of the best-selling smartphone in the world. The Goophone I5 will run a version of the Android operating system that mimics the look of Apple's IOS. Goophone claims to have already patented its phone in China and vows to sue for patent infringement should Apple try to release the iPhone 5 in China as well.One commenter on Goophone's YouTube account wrote, "the clone wants to sue the original...THIS IS THE FUTURE!" Of course, since the new iPhone 5 does not technically exist for the public yet, we'll just have to wait and see.

Better known for its automobiles, Nissan has shifted gears to the realm of electronics accessories with a new scratchproof iPhone case. More accurately, the cover is susceptible to scratches, but it can automatically "heal" them courtesy of a special paint the Japanese automaker developed in 2005.Dubbed Scratch Shield, the polyrotaxane-based paint has been used on the company's Murano, 370Z, X-Trail and Infiniti vehicles. When gashed, the chemical structure reacts by changing back to its original shape, thus mending the damage. Here's a quick demo from 2008 showing the solution in action:The clip shows a minor abrasion healing over a brief period (the video is only a minute long, but the description sounds as if it's elapsed over half an hour -- impressive regardless). Nissan's press release says Scratch Shield can heal small nicks in as little as an hour, while deeper cuts can take up to a week.Compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, the Scratch Shield case is constructed from ABS plastic and was developed in conjunction with the University of Tokyo and Advanced Softmaterials. In addition to its self-repairing properties, the gel-like paint offers a grippy surface instead of a slick glossy coating.The product currently exists in prototype form and is being tested by select journalists and customers. There's no word on pricing, but if there appears to be enough demand, Nissan will ship the finished product later this year. It's also partnering with other companies interested in using Scratch Shield, such as NTT DoCoMo."We're really excited about the possibilities provided by this technology. In Japan, we've already linked up with world-leading mobile operator NTT DoCoMo to allow them to use the Scratch Shield technology on its Style Series N-03B mobile phones, and we think this technology has real scope beyond the automotive world."

Popular blog, iFixit, which says it takes apart tech gadgets in order to examine and fix them, says the latest version of Apple's iPhone 4 comes with tamper-resistant screws. The non-standard torx screw is a pentalobe IFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a blog post. He said Apple has used the pentalobular shaped screw for versions of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. The screws are so rare, he said he couldn't find a single supplier that made it.Wiens says the screw, which he says is roughly a millimeter across in size, is an effort by Apple to make the iPhone 4 impossible dissemble and keep its repair in their hands. Apple has traditionally has liked to maintain complete control over its products.The iPhone 4 is an easy device to work on. Because it's an easy device, that's why they are locking it out, Wiens said. He compared device hardware to a car, and his blog to a third-party auto repair shop.  If you buy a car, you can do what you want with it. It's the same thing with your phone. It's not Apple's phone, it's your phone.To solve the problem, iFixit says it's offering a $10 iPhone 4 Liberation Kit. The kit comes with a pentalobe screwdriver, replacement Phillips screws and a Phillips screwdriver. Wiens does not recommend repeated use of the pentalobe screwdriver, saying it's a hack to get the screws out and then replace them with standard screws. He says the screwdrivers were custom made.iFix is not the only one to have noticed the problem.Another pentalobe screwdriver is being offered by Silverhill Tools on Amazon, for seven dollars.iFixit says the iPhone 4 originally shipped with easy to disassemble Phillips #00 screws. However, the company is now shipping production of new U.S. units with the pentalobe screws. He also says when people take their iPhone in for service, Apple employees will switch the Phillips screw with the pentalobe screw.This is a design to decrease the life of these devices, which increases Apple's revenue cause you have to buy a replacement, Wiens said.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
