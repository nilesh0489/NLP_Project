A security researcher has discovered that any wireless network can pretend to be an AT&T Wi-Fi hot spot and thus lure unsuspecting iPhone users to an untrusted network connection.Samy Kamkar, who created a worm that garnered him a million friends on MySpace overnight in 2005, said in an interview this week that he can hijack any iPhone within Wi-Fi range in what is often dubbed a "man-in-the-middle" attack because of the way the devices are configured to recognize AT&T Wi-Fi connections merely by the name "attwifi."Typically, an iPhone will look for a specific MAC address--the unique identifier for the router--to verify that the wireless network is a device a user agreed to join previously, according to Kamkar. However, if the iPhone has previously connected to any one of the numerous free AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots (offered at virtually every Starbucks in the U.S., for example) the device will ignore what the MAC address says and simply connect to the network if it has "AT&T Wifi" attached, he said."The iPhone joins the network by name with no other form of authentication," he said.Kamkar said he made this discovery recently when he was at a Starbucks and disconnected from the AT&T Wi-Fi network."I went into the settings to disconnect and the prompt was different from normal," he said. "I went home and had my computer pretend to be an AT&T hot spot just by the name and my iPhone continued to connect to it. I saw one or two other iPhones hop onto the network, too, going through my laptop computer. I could redirect them, steal credentials as they go to Web sites," among other stealth moves, if he had wanted to.To prove that a hijack is possible, Kamkar wrote a program that displays messages and can make other modifications when someone is attempting to use the Google Maps program on an iPhone that has been intercepted. He will be releasing his hijacking program via his Twitter account: http://twitter.com/samykamkar.Kamkar hasn't attempted the hijack on an iPod Touch, but plans to determine whether it has the same vulnerability.iPhone users can protect themselves by disabling their Wi-Fi, or they can turn off the automatic joining of the AT&T Wi-Fi network, but only if the device is within range of an existing AT&T hot spot, Kamkar said.Asked for comment an Apple spokeswoman said: "iPhone performs properly as a Wi-Fi device to automatically join known networks. Customers can also choose to select to 'Forget This Network' after using a hot spot so the iPhone doesn't join another network of the same name automatically."Kamkar, an independent researcher based in Los Angeles, first made a name for himself by launching what was called the "Samy" worm on MySpace in order to see how quickly he could get friends on the social-networking site. The cross-site scripting (XSS) worm displayed the words "Samy is my hero" on a victim's profile and when others viewed the page they were infected.He served three years of probation under a plea agreement reached in early 2007 for releasing the worm.

Seventeen mobile phone manufacturers and operators have committed to develop standard for universal cell phone chargers by 2012.The initiative, led by the European mobile communications organization GSMA, seeks to adopt a universal connection and a common energy-efficient format that could result in an estimated 50 percent reduction in standby energy consumption and tens of thousands of tons of duplicate chargers.The group said phones would have a micro USB interface, currently used by some phones and by other devices such as digital cameras.Universal chargers would also make life easier for consumers, the GSMA said. Phones could be shipped cheaper, with no charger cord, since eventually most consumers would have one. And consumers would not be left with drawers of old chargers to sort through.Some of the industry’s biggest players are not included in the group, however, including Cupertino-based Apple Inc., whose popular iPhone uses a proprietary 30-pin cable; Sunnyvale-based Palm Inc.; and Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry smart phone tops the market.The companies that have joined the initiative are AT&T, KTF, LG, mobilkom austria, Motorola, Nokia, Orange, Qualcomm, Samsung3 Group, Sony Ericsson, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, T-Mobile and Vodafone.

Pre-orders for the iPhone 5 went live at midnight and, true to form, they went like hotcakes. You may remember that it took 22 hours for the iPhone 4S and about 20 hours for the iPhone 4 to sell out of its pre-order, launch-day stock.The iPhone 5 took just about 60 minutes. Yep. One hour after pre-orders went live, Apple.com adjusted shipping expectations from one to two weeks due to the overwhelming demand.Demand for the phone caused problems on Apple’s website and several of the wireless carriers’ sites, as many users were met with error messages when they attempted to pre-order the new iPhone. There’s always plenty of hubbub around Apple product launches, though the pre-order launch of the iPhone 4S came and went without problems on Apple.com or carrier sites. It wouldn’t be surprising if this turns out to be an indication of what’s to come.All summer we were subjected to seemingly endless speculation and rumors regarding every last detail of the new, new iPhone. But, when it was finally unveiled this week, the reviews — which, while still characterized by the usual fanboi excitement — seemed more lukewarm than in years past. Even compared to the recent iPad/Mac event.As is so often the case with Apple, the new phone looks great, with the bigger screen and improved speed ranking as my personal favorites. Yet, that being said, I haven’t yet seen the kind of mind-melting innovation and improvement that would justify pre-orders 20 times faster than the 4 and 4S.Nonetheless, people are still ready to buy it in what will no doubt be massive numbers.“Available to ship: 2 weeks”… man that last week it’s gonna feel like you have an old cement block in your pocket.I guess I shouldn’t be surprised anymore that Apple product launches somehow continue to exceed expectations, the machine reliably churning out another hit. But I am. Mostly because of how rampant the obsession is to buy the next generation of iPhone as soon as possible.MG Siegler wrote yesterday about the way Apple showcases these events, discussing the turn and the prestige. But a couple of sentences really jumped out at me beyond the presentation of the phone.That’s what really matters. The bottom line sits atop everything else. And the bottom line is that, despite the phone not having any of those drastic changes some hoped for (NFC?) and a lack of an overwhelming “wow” factor, so many people went online at midnight or past — on a work night no less — to shell out hundreds of dollars for a pre-order jubilee that had sites crashing and the first batch selling out in 60 minutes.That’s why Apple is the most valuable company in the world.The question is: The iPhone 4S had Siri, which captured our attention in full, even if she’s been a disappointment since … so what feature or tool will be that for the 5?Update: The ship time on Apple’s site is now 2-3 weeks:And Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told AllThingsD: “Pre-orders for iPhone 5 have been incredible. We’ve been completely blown away by the customer response.”

The bizarre gathering, which morphed into a spirited Michael Jackson "Thriller" dance routine, marked the completion of its Windows Phone 7 software, and showed how badly Microsoft wants to resurrect itself in the viciously competitive phone market.The new software, which will be publicly unveiled on October 11 and expected on handsets in stores by November, is Microsoft's last chance, some analysts say, to catch up with Apple and Google Inc's Android smartphones, after squandering its strong market position in only a few years.A group of smartphone manufacturers including Samsung and HTC Corp are expected to roll out Microsoft-based phones for the holiday season.Whether they will be good enough to render the iPhone obsolete is the question."The product can't be an also-ran that just does everything that is already out in the marketplace," said Bryan Keane, an analyst for Alpine Mutual Funds, which holds Microsoft shares. "Right now, it isn't apparent that Windows 7 is better than anything that's out there, except that it might have a better tie-in to the actual Windows platform."By the admission of Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, the company "missed a generation" with Windows Mobile, its last phone operating system, which floundered while the iPhone and Android roared past with sumptuous touch screens and a host of new applications.Microsoft is now fourth in the fast-growing U.S. market for smartphone operating systems with a share of less than 12 percent, according to research firm comScore, behind BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd, Apple and Google.Microsoft's strange disappearance from the phone market, and its delayed response to the emergence of tablet devices like Apple's iPad, has been seen as a drag on Microsoft's shares, which are down 20 percent this year."The market is really fearful of their positioning in those two markets (phones and tablets)," said Ken Allen, Baltimore-based portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, which holds Microsoft shares. "Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock."Investors were not impressed with Microsoft's last attempt to launch a new phone, the Kin, which was dropped after fewer than three months on the market.Whether the new phones can make up for that error and lift concerns will depend on how the handsets measure up and how much the network carriers promote the phones.Prototypes of the new devices, which have been demonstrated by Microsoft employees over the past few months, look to be a huge improvement over the last version of Microsoft's phone software. They have a touch-screen interface resembling the company's Zune music player and movable 'tiles' that access various phone functions.But at first glance, they don't appear to offer radical new features that rivals lack.Launch phones are expected from Samsung, LG and HTC Corp, while AT&T Inc is expected to be the initial U.S. network provider, according to a person familiar with the launch plans. Microsoft and AT&T declined comment. None of the handset makers immediately replied to requests for details.All three of those phone makers already offer Android-based phones, while AT&T is currently the sole carrier for the iPhone, which means none has too much riding on the success of the new software, which could be a problem for Microsoft."We'll have to see how much vendor support (Microsoft) gets behind it -- that was partially what drove Android success," said Keane at Alpine. "But now, their problem is, 'We already have Android and the iPhone, do we need a third one?'."

In the last five weeks, Apple has revamped its entire product lineup with new iPods, iPhones and computers. But on Thursday it said those products would be more expensive to make, nibbling into its ample profits.That forecast for the holiday quarter was the main blemish on an otherwise solid financial report. Apple said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 24 percent, largely because of a surge in sales of the iPhone, a product that now accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales.The quarter ended Sept. 29 was the first to reflect sales of the iPhone 5, which was introduced Sept. 21. Apple has struggled to deliver enough of the devices to meet customer demand, making them tough to find in many retail stores. The company’s shares have fallen 9 percent since the product hit the market, in part because of investor concerns about short supply.In a conference call with analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said that demand for the new iPhone was “extremely robust” and that the company had a significant number of back orders for it. He said production had picked up substantially since earlier this month.The profit report was slightly below analysts’ expectations, and Apple’s stock was largely unchanged in after-hours trading. It fell 1.2 percent to $609.54 in regular trading.Underscoring how drastically Apple’s business has been transformed by mobile products, revenue from the iPhone rose 56 percent to $17.13 billion, making up 48 percent of the company’s total revenue. It sold 26.9 million iPhones, 58 percent more than a year earlier.Apple said its net income was $8.22 billion, or $8.67 a share, compared with $6.62 billion, or $7.05 a share, a year ago. Revenue for the period rose 27 percent to $35.97 billion, and revenue for the full fiscal year was $156.5 billion. To put that in perspective, Apple’s revenue for the year exceeded that of Microsoft, Google and Facebook combined.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Apple to report earnings of $8.75 a share and revenue of $35.8 billion. The results were well ahead of Apple’s own forecast of $7.65 a share in earnings and $34 billion in revenue for the period.It was the company’s projections for its current holiday quarter that raised eyebrows among investors. The company forecast earnings of $11.75 a share and revenue of $52 billion for the period, typically its biggest of the year. That implied a gross profit margin of 36 percent, lower than the 40 percent margin Apple reported in the fourth quarter, said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Apple executives attributed the decline to higher costs associated with building its new products, which tend to get less expensive over time as Apple gets better at manufacturing them. While this pattern is familiar, the company said the sheer magnitude of its product-line overhaul made the decline in gross margin more severe. In addition to the new iPhone and iPods, Apple has announced new Macs and a smaller version of the iPad, called the iPad Mini.Mr. Cihra said the company might be lowballing its estimates. “They have a history of beating their guidance,” he said.Apple said its revenue from the iPad rose 9 percent to $7.51 billion.As with most Apple products, the iPad Mini’s arrival was widely anticipated after months of rumors and leaks about the product in the news media. Mr. Cook said the rumors led people to postpone tablet purchases.At the iPad Mini event, Apple hinted that sales of the iPad had been slower than expected when it revealed that the company had sold 100 million of the devices since their introduction two years ago, causing some analysts to trim their forecasts for the quarter.“I think on balance it was pretty in line with reduced expectations,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.At a starting price of $329, the iPad Mini is more expensive than many people were hoping, and well above the sub-$200 bar for smaller tablets set by Amazon and Google. But the device could still open the iPad to a new swath of customers who were put off by the larger size of the original.

It's always refreshing to hear the head of a major corporation cop to past mistakes -- particularly in front of a large crowd of on-lookers. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson admitted some misgivings about the way the carrier handled iPhone data, telling a crowd at the Milken Institute's Global Conference in Los Angeles, "My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat." Stephenson drove the point home by adding, "Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital."And, for the record, that certainly wasn't the only thing about the iPhone that kept the exec up at night. Stephenson again,You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model," he said. "Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you're using iMessage, you're not using one of our messaging services, right?No one ahead said it was easy being the chief.

Private information stored in Apple's iPhone and protected by a lock code can be accessed by anyone with just a few button presses.The iPhone, like most mobile phones, can be locked with a four-digit code, but where other phones in their locked state only permit calls to emergency service numbers such as 911 (in the U.S.), 999 (in the U.K.) and 112 (throughout Europe), a locked iPhone can be used to make a call to any number.[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes' Security Adviser blog and newsletter, both from InfoWorld. ]However, that's not all you can do with a locked iPhone running the latest version of Apple's software, 2.0.2.Pressing the emergency call button at the unlock screen, followed by two taps on the home button, takes you to the iPhone's private 'favorites' page without the need to enter the unlock code. If the owner of the phone has favorite entries in their address book containing URLs, e-mail addresses or mobile phone numbers, then those entries can be used to launch the browser, mail application or SMS (Short Message Service) software, and gain access to private Web favorites, e-mail messages, and text messages stored in the phone, again without entering the unlock code.The security flaw, revealed by a member of the MacRumors.com forum, came as a surprise to an Apple spokeswoman in London, who said she would look into the matter.One way to avoid such unauthorized access to e-mail messages or Web favorites would be not to add e-mail addresses or URLs to favorite address book entries.Apple pushed version 2.0 of its iPhone software as being more enterprise-friendly: some businesses had been reluctant to adopt the first version of the iPhone because it did not adequately protect corporate information stored in the device.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — A federal judge says a monopoly abuse lawsuit against Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc.'s mobile phone unit can move forward as a class action.The lawsuit consolidates several filed by iPhone buyers starting in late 2007, a few months after the first generation of Apple's smart phone went on sale.An amended complaint filed in June 2008 takes issue with Apple's practice of "locking" iPhones so they can only be used on AT&T's network, and its absolute control over what applications iPhone owners can and cannot install on the gadgets.The lawsuit also says Apple secretly made AT&T its exclusive iPhone partner in the U.S. for five years. Consumers agreed to two-year contracts with the Dallas-based wireless carrier when they purchased their phones, but were in effect locked into a five-year relationship with AT&T, the lawsuit argued.The actions hurt competition and drove up prices for consumers, the lawsuit claims.Apple and AT&T have not commented on the terms of their deal. In its response to the complaint, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it did not hurt competition.In court documents filed July 8, Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said parts of the lawsuit that deal with violations to antitrust law can continue as a class action. The class includes anyone who bought an iPhone with a two-year AT&T agreement since the device first went on sale in June 2007.Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones in the last three years. The company does not specify how many have gone to U.S. customers.Ware dismissed other claims against Apple, among them allegations that the company broke laws when an update to the iPhone's operating software caused some phones to stop working and deleted programs that users had purchased.The lawsuit seeks an injunction to keep Apple from selling locked iPhones in the U.S. and from determining what iPhone programs people can install. It also seeks damages to cover legal fees and other costs.

A Scottish IP firm is suing Apple over the smooth zooming and scrolling featured on the iPhone.Glasgow-based patent licenser Picsel Technologies says the Cupertino iDevice maker illegally uses display technologies it developed. The firm sued Apple on Friday in Delaware District Court.Picsel claims Apple infringes on its US patent 7,009,626, titled "Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing."The patent describes using an approximate, intermediary rendering of what's displayed on a device while scrolling, zooming, or during other major screen transitions.For example, if a user zooms into a particular object on a device's web browser, the transition is done by showing an approximation of what the final display will look like using scaled data from the page before the zoom.Picsel claims it has spent millions of dollars developing the technology for the patent, which the USPTO approved on March 7, 2006.The company also alleges that Apple knowingly and deliberately infringes on patent '626 with devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, although the initial complaint doesn't provide evidence for this claim.Picsel says the IP has been baked into more than 200 million devices worldwide. Its website lists companies like Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, Panasonic, Palm, HP, Motorola, and Nokia as licensing partners.It appears many of the technologies the firm makes are produced in-house - not collected from other inventors.The complaint asks for a block on allegedly infringing Apple products, unspecified damages, that patent damages be increased to three times the amount awarded, and attorneys fees.A copy of the lawsuit is available here. ®

FRUIT THEMED FIRM Apple's Iphone and Ipad could be banned in Germany after Motorola won a temporary injunction in the Mannheim Regional Court.The case, which relates to Motorola's wireless technology patents, represents a huge loss for Apple in its tit for tat patent battles taking place around the world.However, in typical fashion, Apple immediately said it would appeal the ruling. It said, "We're going to appeal the court's ruling right away. Holiday shoppers in Germany should have no problem finding the iPad or iPhone they want."According to patent gadfly Florian Mueller, the ruling includes an injunction that is preliminarily enforceable against Ireland-based Apple Sales International in exchange for a €100mn (£85.4mn or $134m) bond unless Apple wins a stay.He said on his blog, "Apple is certainly going to appeal this ruling to the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court and to request a stay for the duration of the appellate proceedings. Such a suspension may or may not be granted."Apple suffered another loss today when an Australian court lifted a ban on the Samsung Galaxy Tab in Australia. µ

Several versions of Apple's iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have potentially serious security problems, a German government agency said in an official warning Wednesday.Apple's iOS operating system has "two critical weak points for which no patch exists," the Federal Office for Information Security said.Opening a manipulated website or a PDF file could allow criminals to spy on passwords, planners, photos, text messages, e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations, the agency said in a statement."This allows potential attackers access to the complete system, including administrator rights," it added, urging users not to open PDF files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until Apple Inc. publishes a software update.A spokesman for Apple in Germany, Georg Albrecht, told The Associated Press that the company is looking into the matter."We know these reports and are investigating them," he said, refusing to elaborate.Although no attacks have been observed yet they were likely to appear soon, the German agency said."It has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks," it said, noting that the devices' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world.The warning relates to iPhones using iOS versions 3.1.2-4.0.1., iPads using iOS 3.2-3.2.1 and iPods Touch using iOS 3.1.2.-4.0.The agency said it was possible but not clear whether older iOS or iPhone OS versions could also be affected.The federal agency, based in Bonn, said it was in contact with Apple on the issue.

Responding to a string of complaints, Apple said that the error overstated the phone's signal strength, causing it to appear to lose more reception than it actually does when gripped a certain way.Angry owners said that when they grip it via its lower left-hand corner, the phone drops several bars of signal."We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising," the company wrote in a letter."Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength."Apple's CEO Steve Jobs last week told people complaining about the issue to simply hold their phone a different way.Earlier this week, the company stated that "gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas".It now says the combination of the effect of gripping the phone, plus the error in the way signal is displayed on the iPhone 4, is what is causing some users to report a drop of several bars."Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars."Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place," Apple said Friday.The company said that it wouldl issue a software update within a few weeks to fix the issue, adding: "We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same - the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped."Several users have filed lawsuits over the reception issue.

So I have my Macbook (2008, white, running 10.5.8) set to lock when the lid is shut, prompting me for a password when the computer opens/wakes up. Great. No problem. But occasionally I'll plug my iPhone (3G) into the USB port while the lid is shut to charge overnight. When the phone is plugged in, the computer immediately wakes up - the apple logo glows and the phone begins charging. After a few moments, the light turns off, the comp falls back asleep, and the phone continues charging.Risk I noticed (and repeated to test) this morning.Can any of you test this to see if this is more widespread than a fluke in Austin, TX?

Microsoft and Apple are said to be discussing a deal that would see Microsoft Bing become the default search engine on Apple's iPhone.The move, according to a published report, would result in the ouster of Google as the main search portal on the iPhone.Apple may be looking to ditch Google from its devices in response to Google's launch of an iPhone competitor, dubbed Nexus One, earlier this month, according to BusinessWeek. The story said Microsoft might also be looking to make Bing the default search tool on Apple's Safari Web browser.Like the iPhone, the Nexus One features downloadable apps and an interactive touch screen. But unlike Apple, Google plans to sell an open version of the $529 phone that's not linked to a specific carrier."Apple and Google know the other is their primary enemy," said an anonymous source quoted by BusinessWeek in a story published Wednesday. The magazine said the source had knowledge of Apple's plans.It was not immediately clear how much traffic the iPhone generates for Google, but the number could be significant as the iPhone dominates the North American mobile device market.Microsoft and Apple officials didn't comment for the story.If such a deal plays out, it could provide a marked boost for Microsoft's search business. Bing captured just 10.7% of all U.S. search traffic in December, according to market watcher Comscore, while Google, the number one player, took 65.7% of all traffic. Second place Yahoo grabbed 17.3%.Microsoft already has a deal in place to add Bing to Yahoo's Web pages.Microsoft shares were off 2.03%, to $30.47, in morning trading Wednesday. Apple was down 1.65%, to $211.49, while Google was off by 1.41%, to $579.35, as the markets opened lower on concerns about bank earnings.Still shackling your workers to a standard company PC?

I updated my iPhone 4S earlier today (using the OTA method), and I discovered a nasty bug. My iPhone could no longer remember the names of any of my contacts! I opened up the contacts app on my phone and discovered that all of entries were still there but if I got a text or a call my iPhone would have a sudden bout of amnesia and forget the contacts name.It’s even more bizarre when you’re trying to create a new text. In the example above I texted Erin Hontz. After I selected her as the contact, I wrote my message and hit send. In the message pane (pictured on the right) it would forget my contact’s name and just show the number.I mentioned this on Twitter and many of my followers had similar experiences.• Use the Delta Update (The OTA version) • Be on an iPhone 4S (I haven’t had reports with the 4) • Be On VerizonDisabling (and re-enabling) iCloud contacts did not solve the issue.Have you had any issues upgrading to iOS 5.0.1?This method fixed my incoming calls but not incoming text messages. Your milage may vary. via TSF reader James Foster1) Open the Phone and dial *228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number. 2) When the system answer press 1 for “Program or activate your phone” 3) Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, “Settings updated.” 4) Open the Task Manager (double click the home button) and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications 5) Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe) 6) Open the Message App to verify the fix.If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.

AT&T captivity is the single biggest reason foks who don't buy iPhones don't buy them, so this would be big. It would also be unexpectedly early--most analysts aren't expecting Apple to open up to other carriers until the middle of the year.(We'd be surprised to see Apple actually end the exclusivity on Wednesday, but it seems plausible that they would announce the end...)According to an inside source close to the going-ons involved in all of this, a new tablet of some sort may not be the only thing on deck for next Wednesday though. We have been led to believe by an inside source that AT&T will lose their iPhone exclusivity on the same day, though it's not yet clear what other carrier (or carriers) will be stepping in to also carry the phone.Bonus: 20 guesses about what the Apple tablet will look like >

Let’s step into a time machine and travel through the mists of chronos to an ancient yesteryear. It was a different era, Britney Spears shaved her head, Boris Yeltsin died, and people learned how to print images on toast from the comfort of their own workshops. Oh, and a lil’ thing called an iPhone came out. The year was 2007, and Verizon and Sprint were so scared that they issued these ridiculous sheets to their frontline reps with talking points for discouraging people from buying an iPhone:“Touch screen: It sounds cool, but if you’re a heavy text or email user, it could be challenging not being able to feel the keys as you press them. And how are you going to type without looking with a keyboard you can’t even feel.” “Sorry, iPhone can’t send picture or video message — only e-mail. No over-the-air downloads. You have to connect to a PC to load music.” “Wi-Fi is not a mobile technology. You have to be in a fixed location to use it — and that’s if you know where to find it. And some Wi-Fi hotspots make you pay to use them. There’re also those pesky concerns about security of Wi-Fi.”“The iPhone is an Apple product and has some nice features. It also has a nice price. Do you really need all those features in one device?” “Are you sure 4G or 8G is enough storage for you? To give you a comparison, most iPods/MP3 players hold 40 to 60Gigs or more.” “Using the iPhone on the GSM/EDGE network may be like having a really powerful computer on dial up.”Ok, that last one turned out to be true.

One of the world’s largest oilfield companies, Halliburton, publicly acknowledged its decision to stop giving workers BlackBerrys and start equipping them with iPhones. This is a gigantic blow to Research in Motion because the BlackBerry has for a very long time been widely considered the best phone for enterprise users. Halliburton obviously disagrees and so will many other companies if RIM doesn’t step its game up in time.Spokesperson for Halliburton, Tara Mullee Agard, said to Reuters in an email, “We are making this transition in order to better support our mobile applications initiatives.” The transition she speaks of is the movement from BlackBerry to iPhone over the next two years for 4,500 employees. She also pointed out Apple is helping the company with the process.Apple didn’t just steal a large amount of candy from RIM, it’s getting the dirty pleasure of chewing slowly right in front of RIM.BlackBerry advocates, you are now presented with a challenge: come up with a better excuse than “BlackBerry devices are for business users.” I’m afraid that argument is no longer valid. Oh, and since BlackBerry isn’t so hot with consumers either, what exactly is the target market? Please hurry. The BlackBerry Bold Team is waiting for its next mission.George has followed technology news for quite some time, but he only started writing about it a few years ago. He particularly enjoys covering Apple, but that doesn't stop him from reporting on a wide range of topics in the mobile area. When he's not reporting for IntoMobile, you can usually find George listening to a wide array of music, trying to be funny and sarcastic, eating, or voicing his opinions about all things tech on his personal blog, GT Daily.

In an effort to get around Apple's ban on rival browsers for its iPhone, Mozilla plans to offer a Firefox application that will give users access to their browser bookmarks and history. The app will also let users open tabs from their most recent Firefox sessions.The Firefox Home app is a spin-off of the bookmark and tab synchronization technology Mozilla currently offers as an add-on for the Firefox desktop browser. Mozilla will submit the free application to the App Store within the next three weeks. Sadly, Mozilla has no way to know when or if the app will be approved and available to users, so it's hard to say when we'll be able to get our hands on this app.Firefox Home Coming Soon to the iPhoneWe have been working on an application for the iPhone based on the Firefox Sync (formerly Weave Sync) technology. The app is called Firefox Home, and it gives iPhone users instant access to their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks and the set of tabs from their most recent browser session.

We always knew the Apple / Samsung lawsuit would produce some major fireworks, and Samsung just lit off a corker: the company filed a motion Friday night asking Apple to turn over the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 as part of the discovery process. Seriously! Samsung claims that it needs to see Apple's future products because devices like the Droid Charge and Galaxy Tab 10.1 will presumably be in the market at the same time as the iPhone 5 and iPad 3, and Samsung's lawyers want to evaluate any possible similarities so they can prepare for further potential legal action from Apple. It's ballsy, but it's not totally out of the blue: the move comes just a few days after the judge ordered Samsung to hand over pre-production samples of the Droid Charge, Infuse 4G, Galaxy S II, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 so Apple could determine if those products should also be part of the lawsuit and potentially file a motion to block them from the market.Now, the key difference between the two requests is that Samsung had already announced its products, while Apple has maintained its traditional iron silence about future devices. But there's some additional nuance involved as well, as well as some bigger-picture implications -- let's walk through the entire situation, shall we?Now, given that most of the Samsung products on the list were already either available or fully disclosed, it wasn't surprising that Apple won -- in fact, it's more interesting that Samsung had chose to fight back on such a minor issue in the first place, since it had so little at stake. (And it's also somewhat interesting that Apple even asked for Samsung's products in discovery instead of just filing for an injunction from the get-go, since they had all been announced already.) It's a tell: no little compromises means no big compromises are in the works. So now let's step through Samsung's motion to see the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 and try to get a sense of what's actually happening in context.So that's Samsung's motion. It's pretty strange, if you think about it: Samsung is arguing that Apple might file for a preliminary injunction, and that it might happen sometime after Apple might release a new iPhone and iPad. That's a lot of assumptions -- and Apple can basically kill this entire line of argument dead by filing for that injunction Monday morning and saying that Samsung's already-announced products should be blocked from market because they'll cause confusion with the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 for however many months remain before the new versions are released. Neither the court nor Samsung really need to see Apple's unreleased products to deal with that. And even if Samsung wins, Apple will definitely appeal the decision, putting the entire case on hold while things get sorted out... a process that will almost certainly stretch past the iPhone 5's expected release in the fall, rendering this entire argument somewhat moot. And what happens if Samsung eventually gets the iPhone 5 and determines that the Droid Charge infringes Apple's patents and trademarks? Is it going to change the Droid Charge? The potential outcomes aren't entirely favorable here.So why is Samsung even pursuing this? I think it's a calculated gamble for additional leverage. Apple and Samsung held negotiations for a year before giving up and heading to the courts, and I'm reliably informed that there haven't been any substantive settlement discussions since Apple first filed its complaint. That means talks have been at a standstill for a long time now, and I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung was trying to put some additional heat on Apple to try and kick negotiations back into gear. It's an interesting and aggressive move in its own right, but it also highlights the fact that neither Apple nor Samsung have addressed the actual merits of their complaints in formal replies -- this is a minor skirmish before the real battle begins. We'll see if this sideshow accomplishes anything beyond clever lawyerly maneuvering, but for right now it's clear that Apple and Samsung aren't planning to back down anytime soon.

Android has officially hit the big time now that sales of its devices exceeded the Apple iPhoneover the past quarter.Briefly, a look at the numbers: Over the span of a mere quarter last year, Android saw its share of the U.S. smartphone market more than double, as the platform was used on more than 7% of all U.S. smartphones at the end of 2009. The most recent research released by the NPD Group showed that Android-based phonesin the first quarter of 2010 accounted for 28% of all smartphone shipments, trailing only Research in Motion's BlackBerry operating system, which accounted for 36% of all smartphone shipments in the quarter. And finally, Android-based phones are now available on all four major U.S. wireless carriers, with the million-selling Motorola Droid so far serving as the platform's flagship device.So how did this all come together so quickly? Looking back over the past three years, it seems that Google had a very simple but effective plan to push its way into a crowded market. Using a combination of free software, design simplicity and brand clout, Google has succeeded in making an operating system that, in just a couple of years, has grown to rival the most popular mobile platforms in the business. Let's take a look at each element piece by piece:* First, make it free. One of the most enticing aspects of Android from both a software developer and a device manufacturer perspective is that it's completely free to use, as Google charges no licensing fees for anyone who wants to base their device or application on Android. This is a distinctly different path than the ones taken by Apple and Research in Motion, which both only allow use of their operating systems on their own devices, and by Microsoft, which only allows devices to use Windows Mobile through a licensing agreement.* Second, keep it simple. When Google went about attracting application developers to its new platform, it made a big deal about the Android software development kit's ease of use. And since Android is Linux platform that uses Java as its programming language, most software developers on the market haven't had much difficulty in writing programs for the operating system.Google has also gone out of its way to make posting a new application on the Android Market a snap, as the company does not screen any applications sent to the store and will only remove applications if it has received legitimate customer complaints about them."We created an account, uploaded our apps and then hit submit," said Ilya Eliashevsky, the product manager for app developer DataViz's Android product line, last year. "Then the app just started showing up on devices and we saw sales immediately starting to roll in."* Finally, be Google. There have been ambitious platform developers in the past who have tried to mainstream open source in the mobile OS market, but none of them so far have had the market clout of Google. Google's brand recognition not only helps it attract media attention to its initiatives but also helps it more quickly develop relationships with device manufacturers, carriers and app developers. In other words, while you obviously need to develop a strong mobile platform that device manufacturers, software developers and consumers want to use, it doesn't hurt to be the world's No.1 search engine either.Read more about anti-malware in Network World's Anti-Malware section.

Apple could be just days away from becoming the subject of an unpleasant antitrust inquiry into a recent decision to restrict software development on the iPhone and iPad. Nevermind Apple’s moral policing which always ignites the heated debate among our readers, this is a much more serious issue than app rejections, the one with potentially far-reaching implications for the Californian firm.From Apple’s perspective, they are entitled to define user experience on the iPhone platform which is – mind you – neither open-sourced nor open in the Android sense. Apple’s unmatched ability to create gadgets that “just work” stems from their tight control of the entire widget, including software, hardware, apps, services, and user interfaces. Take this control away from Apple and you have just another gadget vendor that builds dull products.The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is thinking different about such a closed ecosystem. According to New York Post, Apple could be “in the eye of regulatory storm” and might even face an antitrust probe over its lock out on iPad and iPhone. A source “familiar with the matter” told the publication that:The inquiry could pave the way for a fully-fledged investigation if the agencies conclude that Apple’s controversial decision to prohibit app development does in fact stifle competition. According to Steve Jobs’ widely publicized rambling titled “Thoughts on Flash,” Apple sees third party cross-development tools as a big no-no because they lead to “sub-standard apps and hinder the enhancement and progress” of the platform. It’s a fight for developers’ resources because programmers must choose between “developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously,” New York Post noted.Developers with limited budgets are hurt the most because their focus on iPhone inevitably comes at the expense of other platforms. Jobs has a point, too, because cross-development tools do enable only the lowest common denominator set of features, as he summed it up nicely:If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers. This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor’s platforms.Apple’s our-way-or-the-highway approach makes sense from their way of doing things.  By the way, Adobe’s shares dipped two percent the day Apple published that piece. We’ll find out soon if the DoJ and FTC can establish the case against Apple, but we can help but wonder who’s next?Probe Microsoft because Windows doesn’t run Linux apps? Go after Sony because it only sells Sony Pictures movies on Playstation Network? Bring movie studios to justice because we aren’t allowed to watch FairPlay-DRM’d iTunes movies on non-Apple devices? Hit Adobe because its Flash is killing the prospect of open videos? Meet us in comments.Read more at New York Post

A new lawsuit alleges AT&T is regularly overcharging iPhone and iPad customers for data usage, in some cases up to 300% more.[ad#Google Adsense 300x250 in story]Lawyers for the lawsuit said they spent $80,000 testing devices in preparation for their day in court. In one instance, lawyers purchased a brand new iPhone and turned off everything that could affect data usage. When the bill came in from AT&T, there were 35 transactions for data usage, according to MSNBC.Lawyers said that AT&T overcharged on every single transaction. Not once did a data usage charge go in favor of the customer. Lawyers said that AT&T systematically overstated data usage by 7-14% and sometimes up to 300%.While they said that individual charges may add up to $10 or $15 a month, with millions of customers, it’s quite a boon for AT&T.One lawyer compared the AT&T charges to a rigged gas pump where you pay for a gallon of gas and only get 9/10 of a gallon.AT&T says the charges are “without merit” and says customers misunderstand how data is charged. The company points to things like automatic app updates in the background that customers may not be aware of.

Apple on Monday rested its case that Samsung ripped off the design of the iPhone and iPad while building its own mobile products. Meanwhile, three of the Samsung phones that Apple labeled as infringing were tossed from the trial.It was a minor victory for Samsung. The Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S i9000, and Galaxy S II i9100 were thrown out of the case by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh after questions about whether the phones were even sold in the US. The devices were dropped from the case because they are “world phones that could be purchased in the US., but that weren't sold by Samsung's telecommunications and electronics divisions in the US,” according to CNET.All Things D points out, however, that the ruling does not affect the US-specific versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S and Galaxy SII phones, which are among roughly 20 devices Apple has identified as infringing its intellectual property. Moreover, the three phones were essentially worthless in Apple's case from a financial perspective. Apple's damages report assigned the three phones a worth of $0, the only phones in the case with such a distinction.Samsung tried to get a larger victory today, asking for a Judgment as a Matter of Law that Apple hasn’t proven its case, and that no reasonable jury could possibly side with Apple. Koh rejected Samsung’s request, meaning the case will, as expected, move forward to the next phase. Earlier on Monday, Apple’s expert witness on financial matters testified regarding the damages Apple is seeking, a number that recently grew from $2.5 billion to $2.88 billion.With Apple resting its case, Samsung was able to start its defense late this afternoon. Samsung's first witness was Benjamin Bederson, chief scientist and co-founder of a mobile company called Zumobi. Bederson is testifying on Samsung's behalf because he helped create a user interface for mobile touchscreen devices called LaunchTile, which was apparently used in conjunction with Microsoft's Pocket PC software and the HP iPAQ device starting in November 2004. Samsung believes LaunchTile should count as prior art, making some of Apple's patents invalid because the technology already existed, according to a Forbes liveblog of the trial. After Bederson, one of the people behind a 2001 touchscreen tabletop computer called DiamondTouch also testified on the prior art issue.We’ll hear much more about why Samsung doesn't think it infringed Apple’s patents as the week goes on. Judge Koh is reportedly aiming to move to closing arguments by Tuesday of next week before handing the case off to the jury.

SAN JOSE -- Apple released late Tuesday its best evidence that Samsung has copied its patents and trade dress, a 132-page Samsung report comparing its handsets to the iPhone.The report methodically compares the iPhone and Samsung's S1 handset across 126 specific features. A page is dedicated to each feature with each page showing side-by-side comparisons of how the iPhone and the S1 implement the feature.At the bottom of each page, the report makes recommendations for how Samsung could improve its handsets. The direction generally is to more closely adopt Apple's practices.Apple sees this document from a product engineering team in Samsung's software verification group as its smoking gun. Samsung counters the document is merely observing and benchmarking best practices in the industry as one aspect of competition.We'll let you decide by looking at some examples of the document below. We invite your comments. Is this evidence of illegal copying or normal industry benchmarking?Let's start with the cover:

In the late '70s, when I was just out of college, and even before I began my career as a journalist, I worked in public relations at Hewlett-Packard Co.These were the final years of HP as "the world's greatest company" under its two founders. ... And being in such comfortable and friendly surroundings and working for such an enlightened employer basically spoiled me for any other job thereafter.Indeed, there were only two problems with that job:1. I didn't want to be a PR man;As it happened, the two were closely related. Simon was a great big, linebacker-sized guy who was both whip-smart and tough. He was a few years older than me and was working for a weekly industry newsprint tabloid called Electronic News. EN was notorious for underpaying its reporters (which was why they were usually young and destined to quickly move on) and for having neither the time nor inclination to do much more editorially than rewrite corporate press releases.That is, until Mark Simon came along.He was as young and transient as the rest of EN's reporters; but he was also clever and fearless. Suddenly, under his byline, stories started appearing the likes of which the electronics trade press, notoriously deferential to the giant companies of the tech world, had never seen. Simon broke insider stories, published internal strategy memos and pre-introduced secret projects, all with seeming abandon ... leaving corporate PR departments, like us at HP, scrambling to do damage control and plug the leaks.As the kid in HP corporate PR department, I both feared Simon for the damage he could do with his breaking stories -- my turf was hugely successful calculator business -- and was in awe of his reporting skills. I also wasn't allowed to talk much with him when he came into our offices for fear I would slip up and accidentally give my counterpart another news hook.It wasn't until years later, when I was a reporter myself (and talked with Mark) that I came to realize that all Simon was doing was just good hard reporting. His techniques ranged from learning to read upside down the memos on executives' desks while conducting interviews, cold calling low-level employees who didn't know better than to talk with the press, pretending to know information to get official confirmation, and the whole rest of the toolkit of good investigative reporting.Mark also told me that the biggest source for his insider information was, in fact, the rising golden boy executive at HP, who got a kick out of making controlled leaks to manipulate the press and his counterparts at the company.Mark went on to become a distinguished political reporter in Sacramento for the San Francisco Chronicle. And, having seen him in action, I redoubled my efforts to become a newspaperman myself -- which I accomplished a couple years later. And in those first years in the newsroom, I tried to pattern myself on what I had seen of Simon in action. He was my gold standard.That was a long time ago. But what's important today about that story is that no matter how furious HP was at Mark Simon's ability to pre-announce its products and expose internal company documents, it never once crossed anyone's mind to call the cops on him.

Although previous versions of Windows Mobile have long supported a clipboard to move content around, the Windows Phone 7 Series devices due out this year won't have that ability.LAS VEGAS--The new Windows Phones have a lot of things that prior versions of Windows Mobile haven't had, most notably a cool factor.But one thing that the 7 Series devices won't have--at least not this year's crop--is the ability to broadly copy and paste items. As earlier noted by Engadget, Microsoft confirmed on Tuesday that developers shouldn't expect to have access to a clipboard to allow users to copy and paste. Nor will Microsoft's own Office applications have copy and paste. That's despite the fact that it has been a staple of past versions of Windows Mobile for as long as I can recall."We don't enable copy and paste and we do that very intentionally," Windows Phone executive Todd Brix said in an interview.Brix said many times when a user copies something on a phone, what they really are looking to do is take a specific action, such as calling a phone number or e-mailing an address. For those specific tasks, Microsoft has what it calls "smart linking," which lets a user double click on a phone number and either call it or add it to the phone book. For an address, one can get a map without having to copy and paste the address."It's actually an intentional design decision," he said. "We try to anticipate what the user wants so copy and paste isn't necessary."But, particularly for a device that is going to include Word and other mobile Office applications, the concept of intelligent links doesn't seem sufficient. The BlackBerry for example, offers both intelligent links and a copy-and-paste system, which seems to me to be ideal.Brix insists that most users won't miss copy and paste and said that it was a matter of focus; Microsoft said it wanted to really do well the tasks that 80 percent of users wanted."We tried to focus on what the core use cases were," Brix said. "Certainly there will be some people that wont be happy with some of those decisions."If this feels like deja vu, a similar limitation hampered the initial iPhone, with Apple later going back and adding the feature.As my colleague Jessica Dolcourt noted recently, it's not like users don't want copy and paste. We just take it for granted unless some one boldy chooses to omit it.With the 7 Series taking so many cues from the iPhone, I'm surprised Microsoft didn't learn that lesson.

Cybersecurity researcher Charlie Miller and his fellow researcher Collin Mulliner plan to present research on a huge iPhone security hole Thursday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. Not an iPhone virus, but rather an SMS hack, the issue can allow a hacker complete control over an iPhone.According to the researchers, they will demonstrate how to send a series of mostly invisible SMS "bursts" that can give a hacker complete control of the iPhone. That control will include dialing the phone, visiting Web sites, turning on the device's camera and microphone, and more. The hacker will also be able to send more text messages to facilitate spreading the iPhone SMS hack to other iPhones.To an end user, the evidence that someone is trying to use the iPhone's SMS hack on your device will be a text message on your iPhone containing only a single square character. The only way to avoid being hacked would be to quickly turn off the device. In terms of the amount of control, this hack sounds, quite honestly, very similar to how certain Trojans can turn a PC into a bot, and similarly control it remotely."This is serious. The only thing you can do to prevent it is turn off your phone. Someone could pretty quickly take over every iPhone in the world with this."That's a bit of hyperbole, as first a hacker would have to know the appropriate phone numbers to use to hack an iPhone (and there are plenty of phone numbers assigned to other devices). It is obviously very serious, and despite the researchers sharing their results with Apple over a month ago, there has been no movement on a fix as of yet.Interestingly, the researchers also found a similar "remote control" texting bug in Windows Mobile, and other bugs in Android and the iPhone that can let hackers boot the phones off the network. The Android bug has been closed, but the second iPhone bug has not.Miller and Mulliner also found a hole in the iPhone's Safari browser way back in 2007 when it was first launched.Comment and add to the story without registration, but keep the comments meaningful please.

Citigroup Inc. said its free U.S. mobile-banking application for Apple Inc.'s iPhone contained a security flaw and advised its customers to upgrade to a newer version that corrects the problem.In an incident that highlights the growing security challenges around wireless apps, Citi said its iPhone app accidentally saved information—including account numbers, bill payments and security access codes—in a hidden file on users' iPhones. The information may also have been saved to a user's computer if it had been synched with an iPhone.The issue affected the approximately 117,600 customers who had registered the iPhone app with Citi since its launch in March 2009, a person familiar with the matter said. The bank doesn't believe any personal data was exposed by the flaw."We have no reason to believe that our customers' personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately by anyone," Citi said. Apple acknowledged the issue and encouraged users to download the updated app.Mobile banking is a popular and fast-growing activity on smartphones, as cellphones become more sophisticated and consumers use them to organize their lives. The Citi Mobile app, currently the 11th most-popular offering in the finance category of Apple's App Store, allows customers to check balances, transfer funds and pay bills.An estimated 18 million adults, or 7% of the adult population, are "active users" of mobile banking, meaning they use it at least once every three months—a small but growing fraction of the 196 million adults, or 84% of the population, who use any kind of banking services, said Red Gillen, a mobile- banking analyst at Celent, a financial-services research firm.Citibank, with an estimated 800,000 mobile customers, ranks No. 5 in mobile banking, Celent said, behind Bank of America Corp. at No. 1 with an estimated 5 million users. In between are J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. at No. 2 with 2 million, United Services Automobile Association at No. 3 with 1.5 million, and Wells Fargo & Co. with 1.4 million, according to Celent estimates.Experts worry that security isn't keeping up with the app boom. Among their concerns is the prospect of "leakage" any time a wireless app logs confidential data. The risk of flaws like Citi's, says John Hering, CEO of mobile security provider Lookout, is that a hacker could devise a malicious app to retrieve sensitive information stored on an iPhone.Citi said its mobile-banking app is the only application authorized to access the hidden data. The upgraded application, released July 19, doesn't store the information and deletes any account data that may have been saved to a user's iPhone or computer.Citi said the problem was discovered in a routine security review. The bank told customers of the problem in a letter dated July 20. Other Citi mobile apps such as the app for credit-card customers weren't affected, Citi said in a statement.Citi developed the application with mobile financial-services provider mFoundry . Drew Sievers, CEO of mFoundry, a private company based in Larkspur, Calif., said his company custom-wrote the mobile-banking part of the application and handed it over to Citibank, which then combined it with custom code of its own.Citi is responsible for distributing and managing the app, Mr. Sievers said. MFoundry, which provides mobile-banking software to 150 banks and credit unions besides Citi, said none of its other customers were affected by the problem.Citi said it performed security tests before and after releasing the application, but failed to detect the problem. The bank said it is looking into why it didn't find the vulnerability earlier.Mr. Hering, the CEO of Lookout, said his company is discovering more apps that could inadvertently expose or leak personal data, such as location information and phone numbers. "Most consumers and app developers don't know what is happening in their apps, because it is moving so fast," Mr. Hering said. "Apps are proliferating so quickly. We will see more and more of this."

We knew this day would eventually come, but somehow we're still misting up a little -- Linux has been ported to the iPhone and iPod touch. Dev Team member planetbeing is the mastermind in charge of bringing everyone's favorite open-source OS to Apple's handhelds, and while it's a little rough around the edges (read: no touchscreen drivers, sound, or WiFi / cell radio support), it's definitely the first step on the road to hacking nirvana. The team is hard at work, and it even sounds like they're thinking about porting Android in the near future (!), so hit the read link to try it out and lend a hand if you can -- or just head on past the break for a quick vid of the port in all its text-scrolling glory.[Via iphone-dev.org ; thanks to everyone who sent this in]

An interesting NYT Bits blog entry covers Opera's mobile browser . Buried in the middle of the article is this quote: "Opera's engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone, but Apple won't let the company release it because it competes with Apple's own Safari browser." It also talks about Opera on the Wii and browsers in cars. A good read. : But back to the iPhone. As tempted as I am to just shrug it off, since Apple is free to run its App Store any way it pleases, as an enthusiastic iPhone user, I think Apple is shooting itself in the foot here, as it is with all the "competitive" apps being rejected. Apple does stand to lose some Google revenue by letting people use other browsers, but they have much more to gain by unleashing the creativity of the developer community and giving them the freedom to improve or replace core iPhone functionality. Hopefully competition from Android forces them to wake up.

Ever wanted to unlock your iPhone simply by having it look at you and recognize who you are? A jailbreak mod called RecognizeMe will be hitting Cydia soon and promises to bring biometric facial recognition security to the iPhone 4. The mod will allow you to unlock your iPhone by scanning your facial features with the front-facing camera and verifying who you are before giving you access.The tweak offers settings for dialing up the level of security (facial matching), which we're assuming requires a bit more processing time, but the app definitely appears to deliver on its promise of facial recognition security for the iPhone 4. The mod looks a little slow at the moment, but hopefully the developers are able to optimize the code before an official release.Check out the video after the jump, and let us know what you think in the comments!

Apple is planning to launch a new version of the iPhone which will work almost anywhere in the world, according to American technology experts.The "worldwide" version of the iPhone will be sold first in the US market next summer by Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone has a 45% stake, according to Ashok Kumar, analyst at Northeast Securities.The new phone will use a microchip developed by Qualcomm that can use both the 3G networks which predominate in Europe and Africa as well as the CDMA2000 network used by Verizon in the US and other networks across the world."This Qualcomm-powered world phone will facilitate Apple to be carrier-agnostic," Kumar said, meaning it would be able to further expand its list of mobile network partners.Kumar's prediction follows a recent report by industry analysts OTR Global which quoted sources in the Taiwan handset supply chain as saying they had been contracted to supply a "hybrid" iPhone by the third quarter of 2010.When Apple initially launched the iPhone in 2007 it did so under exclusive deals with network partners in the US, UK, France and Germany. Since then, however, it has abandoned this strategy in order to sell iPhones through many more mobile phone networks across the world.Earlier this week, Orange started selling the iPhone in the UK, ending O2's two-year long exclusive deal. Orange reckons that it had sold over 30,000 by 4pm on the first day of sales, while Carphone Warehouse believes it will sell a 1m iPhones by Christmas.The success of the iPhone has made Apple the world's most profitable smartphone manufacturer, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, overtaking the world's largest handset producer, Nokia.The research firm has examined the smartphone market for the three months to the end of September – in which 43m phones that can access the web, send emails and download applications were sold – and reckons that Apple surpassed Nokia for the first time ever."We estimate Apple's operating profit for its iPhone handset division stood at $1.6bn in the third quarter of 2009," said Alex Spektor, analyst at Strategy Analytics. "Apple overtook Nokia for the first time, which recorded a lower $1.1bn of operating profit. With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost controls, the PC vendor has successfully broken into the mobile phone market in just two years."Nokia has struggled to produce a lucrative rival to the iPhone. The Apple device has also spawned a host of touchscreen devices from other handset manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and Motorola, all of which have eaten into Nokia's share of a smartphone market it once dominated. Last month, Nokia announced its first quarterly loss for more than a decade.The slew of touchscreen phones that have hit the shops have helped the smartphone market outperform the rest of the mobile phone industry, where sales have been in decline. But Nokia does not seem able to capitalise on the fact that consumers want high-end devices and its share of the smartphone market is slipping.Last month, Nokia said it reckoned the entire mobile phone industry shipped 288m units in the quarter, down 7% on the same period a year ago, but up 7% on the second quarter. Nokia, however, shipped 108.5m units in the third quarter, which is down 8% on the same period last year and only up 5% on the previous quarter.Nokia stripped out smartphone sales from the overall figures, estimating that 47m "converged mobile devices" were shipped in the three months, compared with an estimated 44.2m units in the third quarter of 2008 and 41m units in the second quarter of 2009. Of that total figure, Nokia sold 16.4m units in the third quarter of 2009; that is down from 16.9m in the second quarter of 2009 but admittedly a better performance than the 15.5m it shipped in the third quarter of the previous year.Just a week after the results were announced, Nokia took the dramatic step of launching a legal attack on Apple in the US courts, alleging the iPhone infringes 10 of its patents in a dispute that could drag on for years.

XBMC is a free media player that began life on the Xbox but has since grown to be a multi-platform solution. The XBMC software, which already runs on the previous Mac OS X-based, Intel x86 Apple TV, has now been released to work on the ARM Architecture A4 chip used in the new iOS version, offering the ability to install apps and play content formats Apple doesn't natively support on its $99 box, according to AppleInsider. Furthermore it will be able to be played on the iPad and iPhone.With regard to jailbreaking and Apple TV, MacRumors.com says:The software is not available through the App Store, and requires a jailbroken Apple TV or iOS device. While jailbreaking has been a known way to load third party apps onto the iPad and iPhone, it's not been a very common procedure for the Apple TV. Due to similarities of the underlying iOS firmware on the new Apple TV, it's been widely expected that these unauthorized apps would become available for the device. Apple presently offers no authorized way to install apps on the Apple TV.

Google launched its first-ever Gmail app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch on Wednesday, but was forced to yank it from Apple's App Store within minutes due to a bug, Computerworld reported."Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS. Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app," Matthew Izatt, a Google product manager, wrote on the company's Gmail blog. "We’ve removed the app while we correct the problem, and we’re working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who’s already installed the app can continue to use it."According to Computerworld, "scores" of users who downloaded the app were complaining on Twitter that they received a "Notification Error" message upon launching the app. "Googla culpa!" David Girouard, Google's vice president of apps, Tweeted on Wednesday, according to Computerworld. "Sorry, but we pushed a bad version of our iOS app for Gmail. More info shortly - we're working on it."Before the app was yanked, Izatt had written a blog post touting the new app and saying it was "fast, efficient and take[s] full advantage of the touchscreen and notification capabilities of your device."Meanwhile, Google has also been rolling out a new look for its regular Gmail service. On Tuesday, the company wrote a blog post giving an "in-depth" look at the new design, along with a video:On Wednesday, as people got a chance to experience the changes from themselves, many have, perhaps predictably, shared their feelings on Twitter. Here's a sample of what people are saying:[View the story "New Gmail" on Storify]What do you think?

Nokia's Lumia 920 packs the industry's best image stabilization -- there's no questioning that -- thanks to a camera module that pairs both sensor and lens-based optical IS. The iPhone 5 also offers a notable improvement over its Apple-made predecessor on the video front, but considering that its stabilization is of the digital variety, we wouldn't expect it to top Nokia's new flagship. We had an opportunity to test both smartphones in a head-to-head demo at Nokia's research and development facility in Tampere, Finland, about two hours north of the company's Espoo headquarters. In fact, we're told that this is the very first such comparison shoot in the world, considering that the iPhone made it to market just last week and the only opportunity to shoot with a Lumia 920 is currently in the European country where the device was born.As expected, the Nokia phone was able to capture far smoother video than what we snapped with the iPhone, with both devices secured side-by-side in a homemade foam holster. Unlike our handheld interview shoot earlier today, we pushed the limits a bit further this time, running through Nokia's parking lot and turning every which way as well. It's important to note that the Lumia 920 we used was a prototype, but its performance was still quite solid. You'll find the side-by-side video just past the break -- the Lumia 920 is on the left, with the iPhone clip on the right.Update: We also had an opportunity to test the Samsung Galaxy S III (just below) and the HTC One X (following) against the Lumia 920. Both smartphones lack OIS, so we weren't surprised to see poor stabilization performance. Check out the videos for the head-to-head.

It’s supposed to be your "life in your pocket," not Apple’s. But a piece of code discovered in the iPhone operating system might keep you under Apple’s control.Jonathan Zdrianski, author of the book iPhone Open Application Development, discovered a URL hidden in iPhone’s CoreLocation that he believes the iPhone uses to check whether any apps on your phone match with those listed in a database of blacklisted applications. Presumably, that would allow Apple to remotely de-authorize those apps, or perhaps even delete them."This suggests that the iPhone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off," Zdrianski wrote. "At the moment, no apps have been blacklisted, but by all appearances, this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for, if Apple so chooses to shut it down."Hum. So then all of those who got away with NetShare before it disappeared from the App Store aren’t so safe/lucky after all.Now, if Apple were more organized with regard to what appears and disappears from the App Store, they probably wouldn’t need this emergency procedure. What’s the point of an approval process if the useless, $1,000 "I Am Rich" app is going to make it out the door, only to be yanked immediately afterward?

Carrier IQ has been dominating the headlines ever since 25-year-old security researcher Trevor Eckhart posted a paper online saying Carrier IQ was secretly gathering data about users' cell phone activity on the behalf of cell phone companies Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile. The company insists it's not malicious, but that hasn't stopped several parties from suing it for allegedly violating federal wiretap laws.Carrier IQ isn't on every phone - and you can check if it's on yours with a free app from Lookout or BitDefender - but if you have detected it and want to remove it there are a couple options: 1. The easiest is to purchase Eckhart’s own removal app from the Android Market ($0.99), called Logging TestApp Pro Key. You need to root your phone first. And beware: several reviewers have warned that even after you buy the app, you need to donate money before it works. 2. The other way is to flash your Android smartphone with a custom ROM that doesn't contain Carrier IQ. The most popular is CyanogenMod, which gives you an option to opt out of data logging. "We at CyanogenMod would like everyone to know that if you are running our software, you are not running theirs," CM wrote in a blog post.Check out a video demo below from 'AbrahamsTech' of how to do this. As for iOS devices, you can really only block Carrier IQ. For those running iOS 5 and above, simply click into Settings/General/About/Diagnostics & Usage, and hit “Don’t Send.” If you're stuck on iOS 3 or 4, or have a jailbroken device, Chpwn’s instructions should do the trick. Apple told my colleague Chloe Albanesiusthat it stopped supporting Carrier IQ on most of its devices with iOS 5 and will remove it from all products in a future software update—most likely an incremental one rather than a full update like iOS 6.Although Carrier IQ says its software is intended to help its clients monitor network performance and it denies gathering any personal information from users like screen shots or the content of their text messages and emails, many people still loathe the idea of a company recording how they use their phones.For more from Sara, follow her on Twitter @sarapyin.

Free image-browsing app is intended to show what is possible on the mobile platform, but where is the Windows Mobile version?Is it possible some at Microsoft find the iPhone a more attractive platform than the software giant's own Windows Mobile?Engineers in the company's Live Labs have released the company's first application for Apple's popular smartphone--even before making it available on Microsoft's own mobile platform. Seadragon Mobile, which was added to Apple's App Store on Saturday, is a free image-browsing app that allows users to quickly "deep zoom" images while online and is intended to demonstrate what is possible with a mobile platform.Seadragon is the backbone for Microsoft's Photosynth, which allows users to take a grouping of photographs and stitch them together into a faux 3D environment.Other iPhone apps are reportedly in development in Redmond; Microsoft's Tellme unit was expected to release the company's first iPhone app in the form of a voice-activated search for a variety of phones, including iPhone and BlackBerry. A Microsoft representative told my colleague Ina Fried in September that a public version of that program would likely be released in a few months.So where's the Windows Mobile version of Seadragon?"The iPhone is the most widely distributed phone with a (graphics processing unit)," Alex Daley, group product manager for Microsoft Live Labs, told TechFlash. "Most phones out today don't have accelerated graphics in them. The iPhone does and so it enabled us to do something that has been previously difficult to do."

Many iPhone users arrived at work an hour late this morning after a glitch caused their smartphone's alarm to malfunction.In the latest clock woe to strike the Apple device, some phones rang their alert an hour late, while others were an hour early and many didn't ring at all.Users who missed appointments took to Twitter and other blogging sites to vent their frustration.One person who had an unexpected lie-in Tweeted: 'It was set for 8 but went off at 7 I then set it for 9 and it went off at 9'.The glitch is thought to have been caused by the change to British Summer Time in the early hours of Sunday morning.But for all of its fancy features, the iPhone has had trouble telling the time of late, particularly when the clocks go back or forward an hour.A clock malfunction prevented alarms from sounding for the first three days of the New Year, leading to complaints from users that they had missed flights or were late to arrive at work.The devices also struggled to adjust to the end of U.S. daylight savings time in November.One possible solution is to shut down and restart the phone or switch it to 'airplane mode' and then back again - advice that is too little, too late for those who slept in.Apple was embroiled in publicity problems in July last year after the launch of the iPhone 4, when reports about bad reception snowballed and forced the company to call a news conference to address the issue, dubbed 'antennagate'.This had no visible impact on Apple's sales as the company sold more than 14million iPhones in the quarter ending last September, more than ever before.Apple reached another milestone earlier this month when it sold between 500,000 and a million iPad 2 tablet computers in the U.S. alone.People across America queued for hours to become one of the first to buy the must-have gadget.The pattern was repeated in the UK on Friday when the iPad 2 went on sale here. It was sold out by lunchtime on Saturday.

HTC has filed a law suit against Apple seeking a ban on imports of Asian-manufactured iPhones, iPods and iPads into the United States.The HTC caction alleges that Apple products infringed five HTC patents and seeks to have them barred from sale in the United States from their manufacturing facilities in Asia. Apple declined to comment."We are taking this action against Apple to protect our intellectual property, our industry partners, and most importantly our customers that use HTC phones," HTC vice president for North America Jason Mackenzie said."HTC believes the industry should be driven by healthy competition and innovation that offer consumers the best, most accessible mobile experiences possible," Mackenzie said in a statement.HTC, which stands for High Tech Computer, is Taiwan's leading smartphone maker. It is already the target of a patent suit by Apple filed in March alleging infringement of 20 iPhone patents including "user interface, underlying architecture and hardware". Apple too wants a ban on sales of HTC devices in the dispute.HTC makes handsets for a number of leading US companies and is the manufacturer of the Nexus One unveiled by Apple rival Google in January. It also makes other Android-based phones, including the Desire, sold in Australia, which some believe is a potential iPhone killer.While Apple's lawsuit against HTC did not name Google as a defendant, it was seen as a strategic move against Google, whose free mobile software also powers handsets from Samsung Electronics, Motorola and others.HTC's complaints re unlikely to block sales of Apple products any time soon. Patent disputes are common among technology companies and often take years to resolve. The cases often lead to licensing agreements rather than outright bans on imports.The wild success of the first iPhone, which launched in 2007, prompted other mobile phone phone makers to rush out touch-screen smart phones of their own in a bid to lure consumers, not just business users attached to their BlackBerry phones.At the end of 2009, iPhones made up about 14 per cent of smart phones sold worldwide, according to the research group Gartner. Apple inched closer to BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, which had 20 per cent of sales. But Android phones, while accounting for only four per cent of sales, grew at a faster rate than Apple last year.Apple is also being sued by Nokia for patent infringement. It has fired a countersuit against the Finnish mobile phone giant.Canada's Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, has also had its share of patent woes and was accused of patent infringement by US mobile phone maker Motorola in a suit filed in January.

Alright folks, this is the single biggest news in iPhone hacking ever since the jailbreak. iPhone hacker and Dev-Team member Planetbeing apparently just managed to port Google’s Android Mobile OS to the iPhone.I repeat, he took the Android OS, the system that runs on the Android phones, and installed it on an iPhone. I believe this is the very first time someone managed to install a non-Apple OS on the iPhone and the implications of this are absolutely huge.It’s still in alpha version for now, but with some improvements, this would allow anybody to use both iPhone and Android OS on their iPhone. Just like you can do Bootcamp on your Mac to access PC apps, you’ll be able to go on Android to try all these apps that don’t exist, or were not allowed on the iPhone. Imagine for a second that Adobe manages to puts flash on there, well, you’ll get to have it too.Check it out, it’s just sick:To get more late breaking news as it happens, download the AppAdvice iPhone/iPad app!

A US hacker who gained notoriety for unlocking Apple's iPhone as a teenager has told BBC News that he has now hacked Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3). George Hotz said the hack, which could allow people to run pirated games or homemade software, took him five weeks. He said he was still refining the technique but intended to post full details online soon. The PS3 is the only games console that has not been hacked, despite being on the market for three years. "It's supposed to be unhackable - but nothing is unhackable," Mr Hotz told BBC News. "I can now do whatever I want with the system. It's like I've got an awesome new power - I'm just not sure how to wield it." Sony said it was "investigating the report" and would "clarify the situation" when it had more information. Mr Hotz said that he had begun the hack last summer when he had spent three weeks analysing the hardware. After a long break, he spent a further two weeks cracking the console, which he described as a "very secure system". He said that he was not yet ready to reveal the full details of the hack but said that it was "5% hardware and 95% software". The hack could allow gamers to play pirated games "You can use hardware to inject an insecurity and then you can build on that," he said. He admitted that he had not managed to hack the whole system, including the protected memory, but had worked out ways to trick the console into doing what he wanted. Mr Hotz said that he was continuing to work on the hack and, once finished, would publish details online in a similar way to his previous iPhone exploits. In particular, he said, he would publish details of the console's "root key", a master code that once known would make it easier for others to decipher and hack other security features on the console. He said his motivation was "curiosity" and "opening up the platform". "To tell you the truth, I've never really played a PS3," he said. "I have one game, but I've never really played it." Opening the system could allow people to install other operating systems on their console and play homemade games, he said. In addition, he said, the hack would allow people to play older PS2 games on their consoles. Recent versions of the PS3 do not have the ability to play PS2 games after Sony controversially removed a piece of hardware. He admitted that it could also allow people to run pirated games. "I'm not going to personally have anything to do with that," he told BBC News. Gaming firms do not take the issue of game piracy and console modification lightly. Recently, Microsoft disconnected thousands of gamers from its online gaming service Xbox Live for modifying their consoles to play pirated games. Mr Hotz said that the nature of his PS3 hack means that Sony may have difficulty patching the exploit. "We are investigating the report and will clarify the situation once we have more information," said a Sony spokesman. Mr Hotz rose to fame in 2007 at the age of 17 when he unlocked the iPhone, which could only be used on the AT&T network in the US at launch. The hack allowed the popular handset to be used on any network. He has since released various other hacks, allowing people to unlock later versions of the popular handset.

Path has released a new version of the app which asks for permission before it sends your address book to its servers and has blogged about the episode.Dave Morin, the CEO of Path has responded in the comments and I’ve pasted it below. As an aside – never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this to blow up like this. I hope we can keep calm and continue to discuss this sensibly.Arun, thanks for pointing this out. We actually think this is an important conversation and take this very seriously. We upload the address book to our servers in order to help the user find and connect to their friends and family on Path quickly and effeciently as well as to notify them when friends and family join Path. Nothing more. We believe that this type of friend finding & matching is important to the industry and that it is important that users clearly understand it, so we proactively rolled out an opt-in for this on our Android client a few weeks ago and are rolling out the opt-in for this in 2.0.6 of our iOS Client, pending App Store approval.It all started innocently enough. I was thinking of implementing a Path Mac OS X app as part of our regularly scheduled hackathon. Using the awesome mitmproxy tool which was featured on the front page of Hacker News yesterday, I started to observe the various API calls made to Path’s servers from the iPhone app. It all seemed harmless enough until I observed a request to .Upon inspecting closer, I noticed that my entire address book (including full names, emails and phone numbers) was being sent as a plist to Path. Now I don’t remember having given permission to Path to access my address book and send its contents to its servers, so I created a completely new “Path” and repeated the experiment and I got the same result – my address book was in Path’s hands.Disclaimer: I’m not insinuating that Path is doing something nefarious with my address book but I feel quite violated that my address book is being held remotely on a third-party service. I love Path as an iOS app and I think there are some brilliant people working on it, but this seems a little creepy. I wonder how many other iOS apps actually do the same…As soon as you create a new account to Path, a call is made to with your first name, last name, gender and password. An plist is returned which contains the user’s ID as well as other information such as the date of creation.This API call uses basic HTTP authentication (with a certain key) to obtain some metadata about myself – from the binary plist file it looks like it contains my first name, last name, cover photo, profile picture, etc.This is the actual offending call which uploads my entire address book to Path.This is followed by normal API calls which among others, updates my location, fetches my activity stream and tracks events within the app using Mixpanel.This has been tried out on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.

Porissa sattui maanantaina aamulla jotain varsin kummallista matkapuhelimen kanssa. Nuori mies sai epämukavan kuuman herätyksen maanantaihin. - Aamusta heräilin ja piti mennä yhdeksäksi töihin, mutta meninkin kahdeksaksi isäni kyydillä, aloittaa Helminen. Perillä työpaikan pihalla nuori mies laittoi autossa iPhonen takataskuunsa ja nousi autosta ulos maanantaisesta aamuherätyksestä vielä hieman väsyneenä. Pian kuitenkin takataskussa alkoi tapahtua kummia. - Kävelin autosta ulos kaksi metriä, kun alkoi kuulua outoa suhinaa. Kohta paikat kuumenivat. - Ihmettelin sitä suhinaa ja yhtäkkiä rupesi polttamaan. Katsoin taaksepäin ja savua tuli aivan järkyttävästi. En yhtään osannut ajatella, että se olisi puhelin! Lopulta nuori mies nappaa kännykän takataskusta ja heittää maahan. - Puhelin oli ihan liekeissä ja savusi oikein kunnolla. Housutkin olivat vähän liekeissä. Kyllä siinä kädet tärisivät! Pian isä Juho Helminenkin huomasi, että jotain kummaa tapahtui. Koko tapahtumaketjun tallensi firman valvontakamera. - Siinä se ihan selkeästi näkyy, että poika kävelee autosta vähän maanantaiaamun tyyliin, ja yhtäkkiä savua tulee aivan kamalasti, isä sanoo. - Housuihin paloi kiinni sulaa muovia ja kännykkä paloi huonoon kuntoon, poika kertoo. - Jos olisin mennyt yhdeksäksi, kuten aluksi pitikin, niin kännykkähän olisi syttynyt kotona. Siinä olisi sänky syttynyt palamaan ja olisi voinut käydä pahemminkin. Pidän puhelinta aina sängyssä ja olen tässä miettinyt, mitä kaikkea olisi voinut tapahtua. Isä on ollut yhteydessä Appleen. - Ensin yhdistettiin Yhdysvaltoihin, sitten Ruotsiin ja sitten jollekin suomea puhuvalle, katsotaan nyt miten tämä tästä. Nuori on nyt ilman puhelinta ja uusi pitäisi hankkia. iPhone ei ole joutunut mustalle listalle. - Tässä on nyt selvittelyä, että mitä Apple ja vakuutus tähän sanoo. Eiköjän tässä nyt kuitenkin ole jonkinlaisesta yksittäistapauksesta kyse, poika sanoo. iPhone on ostettu maaliskuun 22. päivä ja se toimi ennen tätä moitteettomasti.

For many iPhone 4 and 4S owners, iOS 6 has been a mixed blessing. The features are terrific, but many users are reporting huge amounts of battery drainage that never was the case before the system upgrade.As an iPhone 4S owner, I can tell you from first hand knowledge that my iPhone loses about ten percent of its charge per hour without doing anything but sitting in my pocket. I noticed that with the lock screen set to two minutes, and the screen turned off, the iPhone feels quite warm, as if it's doing something.Many have blamed this on the Maps app, but I haven't even run the Maps app, so for me, that isn't the problem.An Apple Discussion board thread has more than 200 entries discussing this problem and some solutions that may provide a fix in rare cases, but it is no panacea for the great majority of users.Here are a few comments from the Apple Support Boards:Only1jb: "Used my 4S the same as every other work day. Usually come home with about 60 percent. Came home today with 17 percent."John Smith 1882: "100 percent at 8am this morning when I took it off the charger. 0 percent within four hours. No calls. No GPS, no Internet use, but battery was dropping one percent every few minutes. I turned off location services, no change."LocalBus: "Thinking of switching back to 5.1.1 now!! 9am to 10:30am the battery drain is 100 percent to 52 percent!!!!! Something is very wrong."There are scores of other  complaints.Suggestions have been offered, such as turning off location services, Maps, Passbook etc. Nothing seems to work for more than one person.The problem is not limited to those on the Support Discussion. This problem is not just being reported on the Support Site. On MacRumors forums, a user with the handle of DArsenault reported that "Battery life on the 4 is terrible. Since I've upgraded my phone drains rapidly when it's not even in use. My phone dropped from 63 percent to 30 percent in about an hour of just sitting on my desk unused."Others have reported no excessive battery drain, but enough have to make this a salient issue that needs to be addressed and quickly. I've gotten used to carrying my two battery back-up cases to just get through the day.We'll keep you posted as more information becomes available, but it seems like a software fix is in order.

The new iPhone 3G and the iPhone 2.0 software update can best be described as the most successful failure I can remember. Apple has sold an astounding number of phones and applications, and yet is failing in so many different ways:And yet, Apple can chalk this release up as yet another major success. I love my iPhone and other Apple products, but so far my expectations are not being met with the iPhone 2.0 software and the 3G iPhone experience. I fully understand why existing iPhone users are not as excited as new buyers.

After initially denying that the San Francisco Police Department was involved in searching the house of a man suspected of possessing a lost iPhone 5 prototype, a spokesman for the department has confirmed that plainclothes officers visited, but did not enter, the residence with Apple security officials.The back-and-forth saga over an iPhone 5 prototype that was reportedly lost in a bar in July took on new twists after the San Francisco Police Department first denied, then confirmed, its involvement in the search for the device. SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfeld told SF Weekly on Friday that "three or four" officers accompanied two Apple security officials to a home in the Bernal Heights neighborhood of the city. Though a separate spokesperson had originally been unable to find a record of the investigation, Dangerfeld confirmed the visit to 22-year-old Sergio Calderón's house after speaking with Apple and the captain of the Ingleside police station. The police officers "did not go inside the house," instead standing outside while Apple's employees searched Calderón's house, car and computer. "Apple came to us saying that they were looking for a lost item, and some plainclothes officers responded out to the house with them," Dangerfield said. "My understanding is that they stood outside...They just assisted Apple to the address." For his part, Calderón claims that he was led to believe that all of the visitors were police officers, as none of them identified themselves as working for Apple. "When they came to my house, they said they were SFPD," he said. "I thought they were SFPD. That's why I let them in." Calderón also alleged he was threatened by the police during the visit. "One of the officers is like, 'Is everyone in this house an American citizen?' They said we were all going to get into trouble," he said. But, Dangerfeld said that there did not appear to be any evidence that Apple's security team had falsely represented themselves as police officers. "I don't have any indication of that. I'm not going to go there," he said, adding that he plans to speak with Calderón about the incident. Details of the missing iPhone prototype first emerged earlier this week . Apple reportedly scrambled to recover the device once it discovered it was missing, using GPS to track the prototype from the Cava22 bar (pictured below) in the Mission to Bernal Heights. The incident contains an eery resemblance to last year's drama over an iPhone 4 prototype, which was left in a bar in Redwood City and eventually sold to a publication. Police have charged two individuals with misappropriation of lost property and possession of stolen property. However, Gawker Media, which reportedly paid $5000 to obtain the device, will not face charges.

Samsung (005930) isn’t even waiting for Apple (AAPL) to launch the iPhone 5 before taking aim at the new smartphone in a new run of attack ads. The first such advertisement appeared in newspapers on Sunday, comparing a sampling of iPhone 5 specs to a significantly larger list of Galaxy S III features. Under the heading “It doesn’t take a genius,” Samsung’s aim is to communicate that its flagship Android smartphone outclasses the iPhone 5 in a number of key areas including display size and quality, RAM, available storage and battery life. Apple’s iPhone 5 launches this coming Friday at 8:00 a.m. local time and the Samsung Galaxy S III went on sale in the U.S. in early July. Samsung’s full ad can be seen below.

Well, well, would you looky here? Seems like that super-exclusive iPhone leak that Gizmodo and Engadget were involved in has repeated itself in Vietnam.Engadget reported earlier this morning about the leak, and noticed that the phone is slightly different from the one seen during Gizgate, in that the screws on the bottom of the phone are no longer present.Aside from that, there are few other differences. The model is still pre-production — you can see little XXX placeholders on the body — so it may still change before launch, but the front-facing camera looks to be a pretty sure thing.Pro tip: the source link has some awesome commentary on the leak, courtesy of Google Translate. It also has more photos.

The launch of Apple’s latest smartphone has come and gone, sending millions of users home with the latest in mobile tech from Apple. Everything about the iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, and smaller, right down to the SIM card.For the second time since the original iPhone, Apple has opted for a smaller SIM to go in their phone. Micro-SIM cards are now the standard for many carriers, just in time for Apple to adopt the smaller nano-SIM for their devices. This means that every iPhone 5 user, even the ones that are moving from the iPhone 4S, need to move to a new SIM card and throw their old ones away. On an individual scale this is no big deal, but what does such a small change mean on a global scale?Within the first day of pre-orders, Apple had sold more than two million iPhone 5 handsets. This doesn’t include any of the hordes of people that waited outside of an Apple Store on the release day for the phone (which took that figure up to 5 million). This launch was the biggest one Apple has ever had, and the largest pre-order event any smartphone has ever had. More than five million people, most of whom already had a smartphone, now need a new SIM card.Despite the nano-SIM being much smaller than previous cards, the plastic tray that every user is given is the exact same size. This credit card sized piece of plastic has a small rectangle notched out where you punch through and pop out your nano-SIM. The previous SIM and the plastic holder for the new SIM are then tossed in the garbage.The previous SIM and the casing to the new SIM together will weigh about 5.6 grams. If you look at the five million users that managed to secure an iPhone 5 already, that is roughly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated just by forcing every user to replace their SIM card. Nearly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated in a single weekend, and the knowledge that if any of those users move away from the iPhone 5 to another device any time soon, that user will need to change SIM cards all over again.Apple maintains a page on their own website that describes all of the environmental practices, including the things they have done to improve their packaging and manufacturing process along the way. That page has not yet been updated to the iPhone 5, and so does not include any information on what Apple feels the footprint of their latest smartphone is.If you are someone who has just picked up the iPhone 5 and changed SIM, please recyle the plastic.

Someone on AT&T's product marketing team must be trigger happy as the company once again mistakenly publishes a notice about free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users.AT&T iPhone users will not be getting free Wi-Fi access after all.For the second time in less than six months, AT&T mistakenly published a notice on its Web site indicating that Apple iPhone users would get free access to the wireless operator's more than 17,000 Wi-Fi hot spots around the country.News of free access to AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots was reported on several blogs Friday morning after it was discovered that a notice had been posted on AT&T's Web site. The notice, which was still live at 8:30 a.m. PDT but then was removed by 9:30 a.m., said:"AT&T knows Wi-Fi is hot, and free Wi-Fi even hotter, which is why we are proud to offer iPhone customers free access to the nation's largest Wi-Fi hot-spot network with more than 17,000 hot spots, including Starbucks. Now users can relax and access music, e-mail, and Web browsing services with their favorite blend in hand from the comfort of their favorite location."But Wes Warnock, an AT&T spokesman, told CNET News that the notice was published in error."We have not made any announcement regarding free Wi-Fi and iPhone," he said in an e-mail. "The Web page was posted in error and is being removed."The same thing happened in May when AT&T first launched free Wi-Fi access to its Laptop Connect customers, who subscribe to the company's 3G data service for laptops. Then, like now, a notice had been published briefly on AT&T's Web site indicating free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users. It was promptly removed. And at the time, a company representative told The New York Times that the notice had been published in error.I asked Warnock why AT&T had inadvertently published this information not once, but twice, and he had no comment. An AT&T spokesman had told me when the Laptop Connect program launched that smartphones, including the iPhone, would be added to the list of free of Wi-Fi access later in the year. But when I asked Warnock to verify this information, he again declined to comment.It's frustrating enough as it is sifting through the barrage of iPhone rumors and misinformation on the Web. But to have misinformation disseminated by AT&T's official Web site is even more disconcerting. I'd love to hear what readers have to say on this matter. I can't imagine it's winning AT&T any points among customers or potential customers in terms of customer service.

An Apple logo is seen at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California June 11, 2012.The ruling came from Judge Richard Posner in Chicago federal court. He dismissed the litigation between Apple and Motorola Mobility with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled.The ruling is a blow for Apple, which had hoped a decisive ruling against Motorola would help it gain an upper hand in the smartphone market against Android."Apple is complaining that Motorola's phones as a whole ripped off the iPhone as a whole," Posner wrote. "But Motorola's desire to sell products that compete with the iPhone is a separate harm -— and a perfectly legal one -— from any harm caused by patent infringement."Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment on the ruling. Motorola Mobility spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said the company was pleased that Posner dismissed Apple's case.Both parties have the option to appeal Posner's ruling.Motorola sued Apple in October 2010, a move that was widely seen as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent Apple lawsuit. Apple filed its own claims against Motorola the same month.Posner issued a series of pre-trial rulings that eliminated nearly all of Motorola's patent claims against Apple from the prospective trial, while maintaining more of Apple's claims against Motorola. That meant Apple had more to gain in the trial, which had been set to start last week.However, Posner canceled the trial earlier this month.Apple had sought an injunction barring the sale of Motorola products using Apple's patented technology. But in Friday's ruling, Posner wrote that neither party is entitled to an injunction.Since Motorola could design around the minor technological features covered by Apple's patents, an injunction would be an inappropriate windfall for Apple, Posner wrote.Posner also said that Apple had not clearly demonstrated that Motorola phones caused a loss of consumer goodwill significant enough for an injunction."To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture," Posner wrote.In a bright spot for the iPhone maker, Posner also ruled that Motorola could not seek an injunction based on the one patent in the case that it was still asserting against Apple.Motorola had pledged to license that patent - which covers an aspect of wireless communication - on fair and reasonable terms to other companies in exchange for having the technology adopted as an industry standard."How could it be permitted to enjoin Apple from using an invention that it contends Apple must use if it wants to make a cell phone," Posner wrote.At a hearing earlier this week, Apple had argued that it would be satisfied with an injunction forcing Motorola to remove Apple's patented features within three months. But Posner found that proposal unworkable, in part because of the hardship in administering such an order."Because of the potential costs to Motorola and the federal judiciary I could not responsibly order injunctive relief in favor of Apple," he wrote in his ruling.The case is Apple Inc. and NeXT Software Inc. V. Motorola Inc. and Motorola Mobility Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, no. 11-08540.(Reporting by Dan Levine in Oakland, California and Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and Jeremy Laurence)

The highly anticipated iPhone 5 may already be facing competition in China -- and it hasn't even been released to the public yet.Recently founded GooPhone unveiled its phone in late August, according to GizChina, and it looks an awful lot like the leaked images of the iPhone 5 that have been circulating around the Web.The GooPhone I5 runs on an Android platform, and may have a 3.5-inch display instead of the 4-inch display rumored to be a feature of the iPhone 5. Otherwise, the two smartphones seem pretty identical.Raw Story reports the GooPhone will include a quad-core 1.4Ghz processor, 8 mega-pixel camera, high-def screen and desktop theme mimicking the iPhone’s iconic aesthetic. The clone also features a honeybee logo on its back panel and boasts a markedly cheaper price: $300 dollars, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.If this cloned phone is the real deal, Apple may have bigger problems than a Chinese price war.According to Gizmodo, GooPhone, the smartphone business of Shenzhen Shenma Lianzhong e-Commerce, is planning on suing Apple if it tries to release its iPhone 5, citing patent violations.Plausible?Perhaps in China, writes Robin Feldman, Professor of Law at UC Hastings and author of the book "Rethinking Patent Rights."“It would be unfortunate if a country’s patent system were designed to allow this type of behavior," Feldman told Wired.“If this behavior had occurred in the United States, Apple would have an action for misappropriation of trade secrets.”In a report released Thursday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, the trade organization warns of the dangers of "trademark squatting."This not the first time GooPhone has attempted to beat mainstream manufacturers to the punch. According to Wired, the Hong-Kong based company has produced knockoffs of the Samsung Galaxy S3, the HTC ONE S and the iPhone 4. In the case of the Galaxy S3, the advertisements used by GooPhone appear to be press shots of the original product.Copied products in Asia are edging into a very lucrative market. China has recently overtaken the U.S. in overall smartphone sales, according to the latest research from the International Data Corporation. In 2012, China will account for 26.5 percent of all smartphone shipments, up from 18.3 percent in 2011 and nearly nine percentage points higher than U.S. smartphones shipments.The other major issue presented by the GooPhone I5 and its ilk are the lawsuits that will surely follow.Apple is currently embroiled in several disputes in China, over the iPad trademark, Siri technology and the Snow Leopard operating system.

Samsung is suing Apple to stop sales of the iPhone 4S in Australia, just days after the device went on sale around the world.Both companies are now shelling out millions in legal fees to fight more than 20 patent infringement cases in 10 countries. Samsung recently vowed to shift its strategy from "passive" to being "more aggressive" in targeting Apple for "free riding" on its patents.Samsung filed a suit seeking a ban on sales of the iPhone 4S in the Federal Court's New South Wales Registry today, and separately lodged an appeal against last week's decision by the court to temporarily ban sales of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia.Suits against the iPhone 4S had already been launched in Italy and France but today Samsung filed preliminary injunction motions in Tokyo and Australia. A similar case in the Netherlands was dismissed on Friday.It is unclear why Samsung did not file its suit before the device went on sale. Telstra alone has sold tens of thousands of iPhone 4 units in the opening three days - "our highest-selling iPhone launch to date" - according to Telstra's director of mobile, Andrew Volard.Senior patent lawyer Mark Summerfield, from Watermark in Melbourne, said he believed the delay in filing the suit would make it much harder for Samsung to make a case for pulling the iPhone 4S from shelves. He said Samsung may have been waiting for the Federal Court to hand down its preliminary injunction decision for the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which occurred last Thursday."I don't think the chances are very high that it will actually be pulled off the shelves," Summerfield said, adding he believed any resolution would most likely be around the payment of royalties.Independent intellectual property expert Florian Mueller said he did not believe Samsung would be successful in its bid to block the iPhone 4S as the patents it was relying on were "essential to the 3G telecommunications standard".Samsung recently surpassed Apple in global smartphone sales for the third quarter."Samsung's preliminary injunction request in Australia cites three patent infringements related to wireless telecommunications standards, specifically Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) and HSPA," Samsung said in a statement."The injunction request in Japan cites infringements on one High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) standard-related patent and three user interface patents, which seriously violate Samsung's intellectual property."In light of these violations, Samsung believes the sale of such Apple devices should be injuncted. Apple has continued to violate our patent rights and free ride on our technology. We will steadfastly protect our intellectual property."Earlier today it was revealed that despite the injunction on the Galaxy Tab 10.1, many Australians were still ordering the device from online stores.Samsung has suffered setbacks in court in recent days. In addition to the temporary ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 sales in Australia, in the US a judge said Samsung infringed Apple's iPad patents while in the Netherlands a court dismissed Samsung's request to block sales of the iPhone and iPad in that country.Peter Black, an intellectual property law lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, said it was important to note the difference between an interim injunction and a final injunction. Last week's ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia was an interim injunction until the court can make a final decision on the patent infringement case, which is due next year."It is easier to obtain an interim injunction than a final injunction," he said. This was because an interim injunction only required that a court be satisfied that the applicant has a prima facie case, meaning that it is more probable than not that it will succeed at trial.He questioned whether the patent system in Australia was actually promoting innovation in software and mobile technologies, or whether the patent system and these endless lawsuits were "in fact stifling competition and innovation, with the customer being the ultimate loser".In seeking to block the sale of the iPhone 4S in Australia, Samsung is relying on the following patents: This reporter is on Twitter: @ashermoses

The new iPhone 4 uses Apple's FaceTime video calling application to allow users to see each while on the phone. The resolution and streaming seems to be top notch, and using Face Time doesn't count as billable minutes. But STILL, somehow, there are some drawbacks.Face Time uses Wi-Fi so you have to be connected to a network in order to use it.Also Face Time only works from one iPhone 4 to another. Users that want video calling with non-iPhone 4 users will be forced to either find other applications or buy all their friends new iPhones.(Negative)BONUS: Even if you COULD get onto this easily and anywhere you want, if you weren't near a charger your conversation probably wouldn't last very long anyway, as apparently the battery on the iPhone 4, even though it's supposedly more powerful by about 40%, really isn't that much better than the one on the 3GS.FaceTime IS great technology, though, and really where phones have been moving towards for the last few years. There's nothing like actually SEEING the people you're speaking for a whole 13 minutes before your battery gives out in the middle of the day.

This is quickly becoming somewhat of a routine event after Apple’s latest iPhone goes on sale: A number of early adopters are having issues with the screens on their new phones. When the iPhone 4 first launched two years ago, quite a few users got devices that had odd yellow spots in some areas, for example. This time around, the issues are a bit more mysterious. Some iPhone 5s, for example, show an odd bubble effect when their users press the screen too hard. Others report that their screens are flickering and are blurry in some areas.It’s not clear how widespread these issues are, but a number of videos that demonstrate these problems have now popped up on YouTube (via Arnold Kim).Here is an example of the odd bubble effect:This user recorded how his phone’s screen flickers for no apparent reason:And here is another example of the bubble effect:On the MacRumors forum, some users also complain about some backlight bleeding issues and on Apple’s own forum, at least one user complained about the fact that the lower part of his screen is blurry and another reported that his phone shows “a wavy line at the bottom and the top of the screen that is slightly discolored.”We will keep tracking this, but let us know if you are having similar issues with your new iPhone 5.

Google has denied the latest rumors that the search giant will bring free turn-by-turn GPS navigation on the Apple iPhone, although the features could come in the future to other (unspecified) mobile platforms.Reports surfaced on Thursday quoting a Google executive speaking about plans to bring free turn-by-turn navigation to other mobile platforms, including the iPhone, during a London press conference launching Maps Navigation for Android phones in the U.K.."We did not say we would bring it to iPhone, we said to date we've had it on Android and that in the future it may come to other platforms but did not confIn Android 2.0, Google introduced Maps Navigation, which includes 3D maps, turn-by-turn voice guidance, and automatic rerouting -- all at no cost for the user. Available initially only in the U.S., the software does not store the maps on your phone, but uses the Internet connection to display routes.However, Google clarified on Thursday a few unknowns about its free navigation software for Android. Maps Navigation pre-caches an entire route, and it needs a data connection only when it calculates the directions. So, while driving to your destination, if you lose the connection temporarily, the route progress will still be displayed as long as you stay on the initial route.Free turn-by-turn navigation for mobile phones is getting increasingly popular with customers, to the detriment of traditional GPS device makerslike TomTomor Garmin. Next to Google's Maps Navigation, now available in both U.S. and U.K., Nokia introduced in January its own free GPS software for several of its devices, and by now has been downloaded more than 10 million times.

I woke up this morning overcome with anticipation, just like the 599,999 other people who pre-ordered the iPhone 4. I pre-ordered my phone through Best Buy, and it proved to be a simple and easy process. Obvious "foreshadowing" alert.Unlike Apple, Best Buy didn't have any lines wrapping around their store, having staggered their iPhone pickups to lessen the load on their employees. I had my phone for about two hours prior to everyone else in the office—two extra hours of blissful "Haha's!," until everyone else finally picked their own up. I fell in love with this phone immediately. The hardware is unparalleled, it is beautifully designed and the glass back really does look stunning (when it's not shattered), and iOS4 runs like a dream with the new processor.I volunteered to test the phone all day, doing reception tests, processor tests, and just about anything else to put phone into numbers on paper. Not only did I volunteer because I had the fortune of picking my phone up before everyone else, but also because by doing these tests I got to play with my new toy all day (as opposed to playing with my new toy all day and being reprimanded for doing no work because I was playing with my new phone all day.)The final test I performed was to see how well the reception held up while traveling by car. I took a cab from the Giz office in Soho up to Times Square, testing the call quality and comparing it to the 3GS. I got out in Times Square, and everyone was flabbergasted that the AT&T network didn't drop either call for over a half an hour.Everything was great in my little world—I was in Times Square with my shiny new iPhone 4. And then the inevitable happened—or what, I imagine, we'll come to think of as the inevitable. I tried to do the little trick where you hold the iPhone 4 just with your left hand and all your bars drop away until you have no service. Note to readers: Don't do this in a crowded intersection during rush hour. I felt my phone slip from my awkwardly positioned fingers—it hung for a moment at the end of my ear bud cord, like a bungee jumper moments before his cord snaps—and then I painfully watched as it tumbled over the curb in a sudden whirl of annihilation. The back glass panel shattered, and so did my heart. OK, that may be a little melodramatic…but I am really upset.It wasn't even that epic of a fall. It hit the curb on its side, didn't really bounce and then sort of flopped over onto its back, facing up. The side that made the initial impact didn't have a scratch on it—funny how that works with steel, right? But with the combination of the force of the phone hitting the ground from about three feet up and the fact that it crashed onto an uneven surface (street curb), it never had a chance. From the terrible shrill it made, I knew it was broken before I even picked it up. It's nothing spectacular dropping and breaking this phone. If anything, a compelling display of destruction would have been a redeeming quality.I shattered my phone hours after buying it, in the line of duty no less. If only Apple decided to make the back of the phone steel. Or rubber. Or leather. Or not fucking glass, the most shatterable material known to man. But hey, I'm trying to think optimistically here; at least it wasn't the front screen that cracked, and the look gives it character... I guess.

Oh, you knew this was going to happen. Samsung is not taking the release of the iPhone 5 lying down. A new ad declares Apple's phone isn't genius.I don't think they've kissed and made up yet.When one party embarrasses another so badly -- and in public -- you don't expect the hurt one to just take it, do you?And so Samsung is greeting the arrival of the iPhone 5 with an ad that will run tomorrow in certain national and local newspapers (how modern). It is not a flattering ad. It suggests that the iPhone 5 isn't even good enough to be, well, a copy of the Galaxy S3.Clearly, it's been hastily put together, but its headline -- "It doesn't take a genius" -- rather prepares you for what follows.Yes, it's a list of all the fine, rational reasons why the Galaxy S3 is vintage port compared to the iPhone 5's wine-in-a-box.Oh, the Galaxy S3 is full of things the iPhone doesn't have: Palm Swipe Capture, Shake to Update, oh, and NFC -- to name but three.And though there's no doubt that the S3 is a fine phone -- especially for those with hands handed down by gorillas -- there is one small element that Samsung might be overlooking.People don't buy the iPhone for all the features. They buy it for all those quirky, irrational, emotional, maddening reasons that make people's eyes glaze over and their minds work like a blancmange clock.Samsung's biggest problem isn't that its phone doesn't have some fine rational attributes. It's that the brand hasn't captured hearts.There are no lists nor self-help books that can tell you how to do that. That does, sometimes, take a little genius.

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

AT&T is making an attempt to quietly settle with the iPhone user who was recently awarded $850 in a lawsuit over AT&T's data-throttling practices, but the user in question doesn't want any part of it. Instead, he's committed to fighting AT&T and hopes other subscribers follow his example by taking AT&T to court over the throttling of supposed "unlimited" data plans, and has taken his cause to a website called PublikDemand to get others involved.Matthew Spaccarelli won an $850 judgement against AT&T in a California small-claims court in late February when the court found that it wasn't fair for AT&T to slow down data speeds under his iPhone's unlimited data plan. Spaccarelli had argued that he was being throttled after using 1.5GB to 2GB of data in one billing cycle—well within the 3GB tiered plan AT&T currently offers to customers for the same price ($30 per month) as the now-defunct unlimited plan.When AT&T phased out the unlimited plan, however, the carrier allowed existing subscribers to be grandfathered in and continue using it. But Spaccarelli wasn't just downloading 1.5 to 2GB of data on his iPhone—he was using his phone to share the data access with his iPad without paying the extra fee required by AT&T for tethering/hotspot service. This was a violation of AT&T's terms of service, causing the carrier to switch his plan to a limited one. Spaccarelli complained, however, and had it changed back to an unlimited plan.Now, according to the Associated Press, AT&T has sent a letter to Spaccarelli demanding that he participate in settlement talks or his phone service may be shut down. Spaccarelli posted the documents online—something AT&T's letter specifically asks him not to do—in hopes that his case emboldens others like him to follow suit.  "Looks like #att is threatening to cut off my service if I don't sign a confidentiality agreement to talk about settling. I thought I won!!" Spaccarelli posted to Twitter on Tuesday. In another tweet, he directed users to PublikDemand "to get help with small claims court against AT&T."Correction: AT&T reached out to us for clarification, saying that the letter says if he chose to engage in settlement talks, there would be a standard mutual NDA. Spaccarelli's service would only be terminated if he agreed to the settlement but violated the signed agreement.

The iPhone 4 may be available to the general public, but the police investigation into the leaked device that Gizmodo purchased last spring is still going strong. Now there’s been a new development: the EFF reports that the San Mateo District Attorney has withdrawn the warrant it used to search Gizmodo editor Jason Chen’s house last April, when it confiscated multiple computers, hard drives, and other electronics.Update: The Wall Street Journal reports that Gawker has reached an agreement with investigators. Chen’s materials will be returned, and Gawker/Chen will be voluntarily handing over materials deemed “relevant to the case” by a court appointee.The seizure of these possessions was quite controversial — the EFF said it was illegal and should have been protected by California’s Shield Law. When I called the District Attorney about the case in April, I was told that the investigation was on hold as these issues were considered, and that Chen’s property was sitting in a warehouse untouched. It’s apparently been sitting there for months. At the time, I noted how bizarre the series of events were:When I asked if it was typical for the DA to evaluate the relevance of these shield laws after removing evidence, Wagstaffe did concede that it was unusual. Which makes the situation extremely od d— it should have been readily apparent that Gawker would defend its actions using this shield law defense, why put the brakes on after the fact?However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Chen is in the clear. The EFF says that police could “attempt to subpoena the same material without running afoul of section 1524(g) and still proceed with their case.”

Samsung has recently been at the courts against Apple in the US. Unfortunately, as we all know, Apple has had one major win against Samsung – resulting in a $1.05 billion fine for the South Korean tech giant.So, when Apple went on to announce (and soon release) the iPhone 5, Samsung wasn’t going to take this lying down. Samsung have made a quite hilarious poster which displays the similarities and differences of the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III.It’s probably worth mentioning too that we don’t know the exact differences between the A6 and Exynos 4 chips found inside – but we do know that the Galaxy S III’s Exynos is quite a powerful chip set. Most of the differences come in the form of design and software additions, but it’s good to see that the iPhone 5 is on-par (or slightly worse off) then a device that was launched 3 months ago. Feast your eyes on this:

Google's brand-new Android developer advocate, Tim Bray, wasn't afraid to start his first day on the company's payroll by taking some shots at a rival. "A sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers" were the words he used to describe Apple's iPhone platform. Bray was most recently employed at Sun Microsystems and is a longtime open source advocate.Sun Microsystems' loss was Google's gain on Monday, as former Sun guru Tim Bray announced that he's joined Google's Android push in the role of Developer Advocate."Google and I have been a plausible match for a long time," Bray wrote in a blog post announcing the decision. "Web-centric, check. Search, check. Open-source, check. The list goes on."Still, "the reason I'm here is mostly Android," he added, calling the platform "about as unambiguously a good thing as the tangled wrinkly human texture of the Net can sustain just now."Bray resigned in late February from his position as director of Web technologies at Sun and declined an offer from Oracle in the meantime, he said. He will work remotely for Google from his current Vancouver, B.C., location.A longtime open source advocate, Bray's background includes cofounding the Open Text Corporation as well as launching Canadian business analytics firm Antarctica Systems.He also worked on XML for the World Wide Web Consortium.Bray has written numerous software applications, including Unix file system benchmarking tool Bonnie, XML processor Lark and APE -- the Atom Protocol Exerciser.In his new role at Google, Bray didn't waste time before firing a few shots at Apple.The iPhone platform is "a sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers," Bray wrote. "The people who create the apps serve at the landlord's pleasure and fear his anger. I hate it."The iPhone's hardware and software may be great, but "freedom's not just another word for anything, nor is it an optional ingredient," he explained."Apple apparently thinks you can have the benefits of the Internet while at the same time controlling what programs can be run and what parts of the stack can be accessed and what developers can say to each other," he added. "I think they're wrong and see this job as a chance to help prove it."Bray also admitted he still has much to learn about the platform: "Are you an Android developer? Or might you become one? Or have you given up on Android? If you're any of these, you're a person I need to learn from," he said."Bray's addition to Google generally and to Android specifically is a win for both," RedMonk analyst Stephen O'Grady told LinuxInsider. "Tim's intimately familiar with the Java ecosystem and, better, what it's done right and what it's done wrong. For that alone, his hiring would be worth it."Even more important, however, is Bray's open-mindedness, O'Grady said."He has never been a Java bigot; he was a staunch advocate for dynamic languages and the REST architectural style during his tenure at Sun," O'Grady explained. "Whether that experience will manifest itself directly within the Android project is unclear, but he'll certainly look to keep the ecosystem as open as possible."In short, "Google just gained themselves a widely respected and pragmatic developer advocate," he concluded.Indeed, "it is a shrewd move to bring Tim Bray in as a figurehead for Android development," 451 group analyst Jay Lyman agreed. "As he's already demonstrated with some of his comments about the competition, he's not afraid to speak his mind nor to challenge others, whether he is competing or collaborating with them."Lyman recently wrote a like-minded blog post about Apple and the opportunity it's created by keeping its platform closed.While such assets have a potential to "contribute to further fragmentation for Android," they should serve him well in his new role, Lyman predicted."His technical and software development accomplishment and background combined with his outgoing nature should make him a good match for head Android wrangler," Lyman told LinuxInsider.

iUsers with unmeddled tech must wait for Apple patchThe latest jailbreak for iPhones, published on Wednesday, exploits a zero-day bug in iOS that only users of jailbroken devices will be able to fix, security experts warn.Version 3 of jailbreakme.com, which also works on iPad fondleslabs, takes advantage of a PDF-related vulnerability in iOS. Users of jailbroken devices can use PDF Patcher 2 to guard against the underlying flaw while users of regular devices will have to wait for a patch from Apple. Jailbroken devices allow the installing of apps besides those approved by the official Apple App Store."It's as serious as last time when jailbreakme.com was using a zeroday," notes Mikko Hyponnen of Finnish security firm F-Secure. "Last time nothing bad happened, as Apple patched fast."Apple does not allow anti-virus software to be listed in the official iPhone AppStore, so there's no protection via this route until a patch for the underlying vulnerability is published by Apple.The "temporary" vulnerability of unaltered iPhones and fondleslabs illustrates one security shortfall of the locked-down walled-garden approach practised by Apple. The more laissez-faire approach followed by Google with Android has seen an upswing in malicious code targeted against Droid phones, however. iPhone malware remains even rarer than the low levels of Droid Trojans in circulation but, even so, the potential for badness is still there. ®

After successful attacks on Safari and Internet Explorer 8 on Wednesday, the second day of Pwn2Own saw the iPhone 4 and then the BlackBerry Torch 9800 successfully exploited. The annual security competition allows researchers to win any systems that they successfully compromise, and also awards them cash rewards if those security flaws are still present in the latest version of the software.The iPhone was hacked by Pwn2Own veteran Charlie Miller working with Dion Blazakis. In the last three years, Miller has successfully pwned both Apple's phones and laptops at the competition, and he kept his winning streak going this year with a successful attack on the iPhone 4. The flaw used to pwn the iPhone was in its Mobile Safari Web browser; the phone was compromised simply by visiting a specially-crafted Web page, which allowed Miller to run exploit code that allowed him to access the phone's address book.Past Pwn2Own competitions have required the contestants to test against the latest version of the software under attack, even if released on the day of the competition. This year, the software was frozen last week, preventing the use of last-minute patches to avoid exploitation. Successful exploits of the week-old configuration win the hardware, and if the exploit still exists in the latest software, money is also paid out for the flaw.The iPhone was running iOS 4.2.1, as its software was frozen prior to this week's release of iOS 4.3. However, Miller was awarded both the hardware and the money: the same security flaw is found in the newest version of Apple's operating system. Demonstrating the significance of the rule changes, however, was the fact that his exploit no longer worked. iOS 4.3 introduces Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and his exploit code did not take measures to defeat this operating system protection.The next platform to be tested was BlackBerry OS running on a BlackBerry Torch 9800, and this was duly cracked by a team made up of Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and Ralf Philipp Weinmann. Iozzo and Weinmann are also Pwn2Own veterans, pwning the iPhone in 2010. The BlackBerry OS attack exploited a flaw in the operating system's new WebKit-based browser. As with the other hacks demonstrated at the competition, merely visiting a specially-crafted Web page was sufficient to compromise the device.The trio of researchers said that attack was difficult to pull off, not because of operating system protections like Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and ASLR—BlackBerryOS 6 lacks both—but because the system is essentially a black box, with no public documentation about its internals, few useful software tools, and little known about its workings. Even after finding the initial security flaw, converting this into a useful exploit was difficult. In the event, they had to chain together three separate flaws to achieve a successful compromise, using information garnered from two information disclosure issues in conjunction with a third integer overflow flaw to run their exploit code.WebKit, in contrast to BlackBerry OS, is open source and widely studied as a result of its use in both Chrome and Safari: in moving to the modern browser, RIM has arguably made its platform more approachable to hackers and researchers alike. Were it not for this obscurity, the lack of DEP, ASLR, and code signing would leave it easy to attack, with Iozzo describing it as "way behind the iPhone at the moment, from a security perspective."The attack was demonstrated on BlackBerry OS 6.0.0.246. RIM has shipped a newer firmware since, but Pinckaers has confirmed that the flaw still exists.Also due to be tested on Thursday were Firefox, and phones running Android and Windows Phone 7. However, Firefox contestant Sam Thomas withdrew as he felt his exploit wasn't stable, and the competitors on the other platforms failed to turn up. This means that those platforms, in addition to Chrome (which also had its attacker withdraw), are so far undefeated. There is a possibility that this may change on Friday, the final day of the competition.

Who is she? Chinese netizens are hunting the iPhone girl.China's "human flesh search engine" is in hot pursuit of an unnamed Chinese factory worker after photographs of her showed up unexpectedly on a new iPhone 3G purchased recently in Britain.In one of the photos, a young woman dressed in a pink striped factory uniform and wearing a matching white cap and rubber gloves, is seen smiling and flashing a "V" sign as she leans over an iPhone assembly line.The photos were discovered by an iPhone user in Britain who promptly posted his find on the MacRumors forum, setting off a global chain reaction of media interest and culminating in the quest by Chinese internet users to discover her identity.The term "human flesh search engine" refers to this type of mob reaction by China's so-called netizens (internet citizens) to pool their collective resources in order to track someone down.In China, Apple uses the giant Taiwanese company FoxConn to assemble its iPods and iPhones. The company's main factories are based in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen, the booming city next door to Hong Kong.FoxConn representatives have confirmed to several Chinese newspapers that the woman - dubbed the "iPhone girl" - is an employee of the company.The spokesman said workers had most probably been testing the phone's camera and had forgotten to delete the photos. He said those involved would not be fired for the mistake."Small mistakes are unavoidable," the news agency AFP quoted FoxConn spokesman Liu Kun as saying. "I would call this a beautiful mistake."He said the factory worker in the photos was "quite nervous" after her face appeared on websites and in newspapers.FoxConn, which employs over 270,000 people in its Shenzhen factories, has said it will not be revealing the woman's identity.But Chinese journalists and bloggers have already narrowed the search down to the quality control section on the fifth floor of one of the FoxConn factory buildings - where up to 1000 employees reportedly work.Of the six photos in the set found on the iPhone, two are of the "iPhone girl" and four are of the factory in which the phones are assembled.The images have since been plastered all over the Chinese internet and as of the time of writing, there were over 20 million searches for the term "iPhone girl" recorded on Google's Chinese search site, google.cn.In addition, the domain names iphonegirl.net and iphonegirl.cn have been snapped up by web users trying to cash in on the sudden surge of interest.In 2006, Apple conducted an investigation into the work practises of FoxConn after reports emerged of sub-standard working conditions.Apple found there were some instances of overcrowding in worker dormitories and some evidence of over-working and harsh treatment - all oversights FoxConn agreed to rectify.

A federal court decision ruled that Samsung owes Apple more than $1 billion in restitution. Samsung plans to appeal the decision, saying it never attempted to steal anything from Apple's iPhone.Next week, on September 12, Apple is expected to introduce its highly anticipated iPhone 5, but the company may find itself on the receiving end of a patent-infringement battle. Chinese tech company Goophone is launching the Goophone I5, which looks suspiciously like an iPhone in the company's video on YouTube.In recent months, tech blogs all over the world have released leaked photos and videos of what is rumored to be Apple's iPhone 5. The pictures show what appears to be a longer, thinner, but altogether similar version of previous models of the best-selling smartphone in the world. The Goophone I5 will run a version of the Android operating system that mimics the look of Apple's IOS. Goophone claims to have already patented its phone in China and vows to sue for patent infringement should Apple try to release the iPhone 5 in China as well.One commenter on Goophone's YouTube account wrote, "the clone wants to sue the original...THIS IS THE FUTURE!" Of course, since the new iPhone 5 does not technically exist for the public yet, we'll just have to wait and see.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs hated the Android smartphone operating system so much that he vowed he would spend his last dying breath and every penny Apple had in the bank trying to destroy it. Android, created by Google, entered the market after Apple but soon gained greater market share. A lot of Apple fans dismiss Android as a ripoff of Apple’s ideas, and a crappy one at that.But oddly enough, Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Jobs in 1976, says he’s a big fan of Android phones. Woz says he still thinks Apple’s iPhone is the best overall smartphone, but he says there are ways in which Android has leapt ahead of Apple.Android phones aren’t as simple to use as the iPhone, but they’re not that much more complicated, and “if you’re willing to do the work to understand it a little bit, well I hate to say it, but there’s more available in some ways,” Woz says.There’s a theory that Android could do to iOS (Apple’s mobile operating system) what Microsoft Windows did to the Macintosh in the 1990s. Microsoft triumphed because it licensed its software to many different hardware makers and ultimately had much greater market share than Apple, which would only sell its operating system on its own hardware.In the mobile space, Apple is using the same playbook, tying its software tightly to its own hardware. And with Android, Apple is facing the same kind of foe that it once faced in Windows. “I can see the similarity,” Woz says.Worse yet, this time, he says, Apple is up against a stronger competitor, since in his mind Windows was never a very good program, while Android actually is. “There’s not as big a difference [between iOS and Android] as there was between Mac and Windows,” he says.The other difference involves applications. It took a long time before applications looked as good on Windows as they did on the Mac. But with Android, that’s not the case. In fact, in some ways Android might have an edge.“I used to ask Siri, ‘What are the five biggest lakes in California?’ and it would come back with the answer. Now it just misses. It gives me real estate listings. I used to ask, ‘What are the prime numbers greater than 87?’ and it would answer. Now instead of getting prime numbers, I get listings for prime rib, or prime real estate,” Woz says.Worse, a lot of the time Siri says it can’t make a connection to the back-end servers that power the system. “With the iPhone 4 I could press a button and call my wife. Now on the 4S I can only do that when Siri can connect over the Internet. But many times it can’t connect. I’ve never had Android come back and say, ‘I can’t connect over the Internet.’”The Android system also delivers better results, he says. “I have a lower success rate with Siri than I do with the voice built into the Android, and that bothers me,” Woz says. “I’ll be saying, over and over again in my car, ‘Call the Lark Creek Steak House,’ and I can’t get it done. Then I pick up my Android, say the same thing, and it’s done. Plus I get navigation. Android is way ahead on that.”Another gripe involves battery life. “With the iPhone, something happened with the new OS or the new phone, and it just started running through the battery so fast,” he says. “I’ve had a lot of issues with things I have to turn off just to save the battery life.”But Woz says he still recommends the iPhone as the best choice for most users. “The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it’s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don’t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person who is scared of complexity, well, here’s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do,” he says.

Better known for its automobiles, Nissan has shifted gears to the realm of electronics accessories with a new scratchproof iPhone case. More accurately, the cover is susceptible to scratches, but it can automatically "heal" them courtesy of a special paint the Japanese automaker developed in 2005.Dubbed Scratch Shield, the polyrotaxane-based paint has been used on the company's Murano, 370Z, X-Trail and Infiniti vehicles. When gashed, the chemical structure reacts by changing back to its original shape, thus mending the damage. Here's a quick demo from 2008 showing the solution in action:The clip shows a minor abrasion healing over a brief period (the video is only a minute long, but the description sounds as if it's elapsed over half an hour -- impressive regardless). Nissan's press release says Scratch Shield can heal small nicks in as little as an hour, while deeper cuts can take up to a week.Compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, the Scratch Shield case is constructed from ABS plastic and was developed in conjunction with the University of Tokyo and Advanced Softmaterials. In addition to its self-repairing properties, the gel-like paint offers a grippy surface instead of a slick glossy coating.The product currently exists in prototype form and is being tested by select journalists and customers. There's no word on pricing, but if there appears to be enough demand, Nissan will ship the finished product later this year. It's also partnering with other companies interested in using Scratch Shield, such as NTT DoCoMo."We're really excited about the possibilities provided by this technology. In Japan, we've already linked up with world-leading mobile operator NTT DoCoMo to allow them to use the Scratch Shield technology on its Style Series N-03B mobile phones, and we think this technology has real scope beyond the automotive world."

Nokia has just announced that it has sued Apple in Federal District Court in t"The patents in question relate to technologies for enhanced speech and data transmission, using positioning data in applications and innovations in antenna configurations that improve performance and save space, allowing smaller and more compact devices," according to a statement from the company.Although the wording is of course somewhat vague, the suit appears to hit the heart of what has made applications on the iPad and iPhone what they are. Positioning data in applications has become a central feature -- most of the major ones carry some type of location-aware technology.Nokia's suit surely comes as a surprise to the tech community, as it had not publicly made any indication that it believed its intellectual property rights had been violated. That said, it's not the first suitbetween the two companies: a suit last year involved GSM, UMTS, and Wi-Fi standards. A request for comment has been sent to Apple, however no response has been received as of press time. Also, Apple has sued HTCfor patent infringement. (See also "7 Patent Lawsuits That Affect Your Tech.")More details to come as we receive them.

Popular blog, iFixit, which says it takes apart tech gadgets in order to examine and fix them, says the latest version of Apple's iPhone 4 comes with tamper-resistant screws. The non-standard torx screw is a pentalobe IFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a blog post. He said Apple has used the pentalobular shaped screw for versions of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. The screws are so rare, he said he couldn't find a single supplier that made it.Wiens says the screw, which he says is roughly a millimeter across in size, is an effort by Apple to make the iPhone 4 impossible dissemble and keep its repair in their hands. Apple has traditionally has liked to maintain complete control over its products.The iPhone 4 is an easy device to work on. Because it's an easy device, that's why they are locking it out, Wiens said. He compared device hardware to a car, and his blog to a third-party auto repair shop.  If you buy a car, you can do what you want with it. It's the same thing with your phone. It's not Apple's phone, it's your phone.To solve the problem, iFixit says it's offering a $10 iPhone 4 Liberation Kit. The kit comes with a pentalobe screwdriver, replacement Phillips screws and a Phillips screwdriver. Wiens does not recommend repeated use of the pentalobe screwdriver, saying it's a hack to get the screws out and then replace them with standard screws. He says the screwdrivers were custom made.iFix is not the only one to have noticed the problem.Another pentalobe screwdriver is being offered by Silverhill Tools on Amazon, for seven dollars.iFixit says the iPhone 4 originally shipped with easy to disassemble Phillips #00 screws. However, the company is now shipping production of new U.S. units with the pentalobe screws. He also says when people take their iPhone in for service, Apple employees will switch the Phillips screw with the pentalobe screw.This is a design to decrease the life of these devices, which increases Apple's revenue cause you have to buy a replacement, Wiens said.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Recording, communicating during protests, political events could be restrictedApple was granted a patent last week that will enable it to wirelessly disable the camera on iphones in certain locations, sparking fears that such techniques could be used to prevent citizens from communicating with each other or taking video during protests or events such as political conventions and gatherings.The camera phone has revolutionized the flow of information in the digital age. Any time a major event takes place, news networks and video websites are immediately inundated with footage and photographs from the scene.That could all change in the future however, with a flick of a switch, according to U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, published on Tuesday, titled, “Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device.”.Apparatus and methods for changing one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device, such as upon the occurrence of a certain event. In one embodiment, the event comprises detecting that the wireless device is within range of one or more other devices. In another variant, the event comprises the wireless device associating with a certain access point. In this manner, various aspects of device functionality may be enabled or restricted (device “policies”). This policy enforcement capability is useful for a variety of reasons, including for example to disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater), for preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter “sleep mode” when entering a sensitive area.In other words, an encoded signal could be transmitted to all wireless devices, commanding them to disable recording functions.Obviously, the way this will be applied will depend on what is determined to be a “sensitive area” by the relevant authorities.To put it bluntly, the powers that be could control what you can and cannot document on your wireless devices according to their own whims.Given that the major technology companies are set to make wireless connectivity a major feature of the latest cameras, this development does not bode well for photographers and citizen journalists who are already experiencing a major crackdown on their first and fourth amendment rights.“If this type of technology became widely adopted and baked into cameras, photography could be prevented by simply setting a “geofence” around a particular location, whether it’s a movie theater, celebrity hangout spot, protest site, or the top secret rooms at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California.”Steve Watson is the London based writer and editor for Alex Jones’ Infowars.com, and Prisonplanet.com. He has a Masters Degree in International Relations from the School of Politics at The University of Nottingham in England.
