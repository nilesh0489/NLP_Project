Recording, communicating during protests, political events could be restrictedApple was granted a patent last week that will enable it to wirelessly disable the camera on iphones in certain locations, sparking fears that such techniques could be used to prevent citizens from communicating with each other or taking video during protests or events such as political conventions and gatherings.The camera phone has revolutionized the flow of information in the digital age. Any time a major event takes place, news networks and video websites are immediately inundated with footage and photographs from the scene.That could all change in the future however, with a flick of a switch, according to U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, published on Tuesday, titled, “Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device.”.Apparatus and methods for changing one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device, such as upon the occurrence of a certain event. In one embodiment, the event comprises detecting that the wireless device is within range of one or more other devices. In another variant, the event comprises the wireless device associating with a certain access point. In this manner, various aspects of device functionality may be enabled or restricted (device “policies”). This policy enforcement capability is useful for a variety of reasons, including for example to disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater), for preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter “sleep mode” when entering a sensitive area.In other words, an encoded signal could be transmitted to all wireless devices, commanding them to disable recording functions.Obviously, the way this will be applied will depend on what is determined to be a “sensitive area” by the relevant authorities.To put it bluntly, the powers that be could control what you can and cannot document on your wireless devices according to their own whims.Given that the major technology companies are set to make wireless connectivity a major feature of the latest cameras, this development does not bode well for photographers and citizen journalists who are already experiencing a major crackdown on their first and fourth amendment rights.“If this type of technology became widely adopted and baked into cameras, photography could be prevented by simply setting a “geofence” around a particular location, whether it’s a movie theater, celebrity hangout spot, protest site, or the top secret rooms at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California.”Steve Watson is the London based writer and editor for Alex Jones’ Infowars.com, and Prisonplanet.com.

They say everyone's a critic these days, but here's a group whose critique matters: European carriers. Reuters has been asking questions at four major European telecom operators and reports that they're all dissatisfied with the company's current range of Lumia handsets. Describing the Windows Phone devices as overpriced due to their lack of real innovation, glitchy due to early battery life issues, and inadequately supported by Nokia's own marketing, the carriers seem to be in consensus about the new phones' failure to put up real competition to iOS and Android. Put in starker terms, they don't believe that Nokia's Lumia phones are "good enough" to compete. An executive in charge of mobile phones at one of the big Euro carriers is cited as saying, "no one comes into the store and asks for a Windows Phone," placing at least some of the blame for the tepid start to Nokia's reboot on Microsoft's shoulders."If the Lumia with the same hardware came with Android in it and not Windows, it would be much easier to sell."Credit rating agency Moody's has also been piling on, following Nokia's recent warning about lower-than-expected Q1 earnings, downgrading the Finnish company to a Baa3 rating and its outlook to "negative." Still, in Moody's more detailed assessment, Nokia is expected to be "accepted in the market in 2012," with Windows Phone becoming the third leading mobile platform behind iOS and Android.

An app that features a less than entirely honest Hollywood wheeler-dealer has been removed from Apple's App Store after a complaint from a super agent.I am sure honest Hollywood agents do exist. It's just that they don't seem to employ the finest PR firms to proselytize their honesty.This might explain why Oisin Hanrahan, the Irish creator of an iPhone app called SuperAgent, decided that the main character in his game might be a few scruples short of Mother Teresa.SuperAgent seems to have been well received, a reception that might have led to its being noticed by, well, Hollywood super agents.According to the Independent, one super agent may have enjoyed a particular interest in this app. His name is Ari Emanuel. He is the agent for so many important acting citizens such as Robert De Niro and Sacha Baron Cohen as well as directors such as Spike Lee. He is even thought to be the person upon whom the character of Ari Gold is based in the delightfully fluffy "Entourage" on HBO.What is important for today's story, however, is that he has reportedly set his more toothsome legal dogs upon Oisin Hanrahan and his company, Factory Six. You see, the slightly less than honest agent in the SuperAgent game is called Ari.While I leave you to gather your breath for a moment, let me just whisper that it is not the mere mention of Emanuel's first name that appears to have ruffled his hairline.The Independent kindly offers details of the cease-and-desist letter that has caused Apple to remove SuperAgent from the App Store."The game uses the name 'Ari' for the main character, which clearly is a reference to Mr Emanuel, the co-chief executive officer of WME, one of the world's premier talent agencies," begins the forceful cease-and-desist letter.It continues as forcefully it began: "[It] clearly intends to capitalize on using Mr Emanuel's and WME's names for the game and possibly mislead the public into thinking that Mr Emanuel and/or WME endorse the game - effectively trading off the goodwill, reputation and fame established by our clients."Hanrahan deftly told the Independent that because of the "Entourage" series, "Ari" is a name that symbolizes Hollywood in general, not one person in particular. He added: "We're a very small firm, of just three people, and since Apple pulled it we have had no income."I feel sure that many of you will sympathize with Hanrahan's plight. His arguments appear plausible. His game, just as the "Entourage" show, seems but an amusing diversion from the pains of everyday existence.But perhaps others might consider that while saying truth to power is an often alluring concept, one should always think carefully before saying jokes to power. Power is a sensitive soul, one that isn't always comfortable with japes. Somehow, for some powerful souls, taking a joke is like Samson admitting he'd always wondered what it would like to be bald.

Nissan isn?t the first name most associate with the cutting edge of gadget case technology, but their self-healing Scratch Shield iPhone case has the potential to be a revolutionary product in an already oversaturated market. The technology behind the ?self-repairing? case technology isn?t new, it?s been in use on several Nissan and Infiniti car models since 2005. The collaborative effort between the University of Tokyo and Advanced Soft Materials INC consists of an ?outer ?paint? made from polyrotaxane, which means that when damage occurs to the coating in the form of a fine scratch, the chemical structure is able to react to change back to its original shape and fill the gap ? ?healing? the blemish? according to Nissan. Nissan soft-launched the case over the weekend at an automotive event held in Dubai. Nissan handed a number of cases out to customers and journalists for beta testing and announced that if the demand was strong enough they would consider mass producing the cases for a release to the general public. Hopefully the beta testing creates a strong buzz, but that all depends on how well the self-healing feature of case works in real world use.The pockets of gadget owners can be unforgiving dungeons capable of scratching the toughest reinforced screens, and cases. However, if the underlying technology of Nissan?s cases has been used on cars for the last five years, I?m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the material's ability to withstand consumers' pockets.

She had been talking on it and navigating with a GPS app during a work trip to Los Angeles. Then, without any warning or error message, the phone quit.Everything was gone — all her contacts, photos and even the phone's ability to make calls.It was only after she got home to Silicon Valley that she found out that her phone had been killed by her employer, a publishing company.Someone in the IT department had sent out what's called a "remote wipe," a kind of auto-destruct command that's delivered by e-mail. The wipe was done by mistake, and Stanton wouldn't have been surprised to see this kind of remote control on a company phone.But this iPhone was hers."It was my account, in my name [and] I'd paid all the bills," Stanton says. "It didn't make any sense to me that somehow work could get through AT&T, who I thought controlled my phone, and could completely disable the phone and the account."It's no surprise to people who know IT. Since 2003, a growing list of smart phones have come loaded with software from Microsoft that makes remote wipes — and many other remote-control commands — possible.The phone doesn't need to download any new software. All that's necessary is for the phone's user to configure it to receive e-mail from a Microsoft Exchange Server — the kind most big companies use.Once that's been set up, an IT department has the capability to wipe the phone and turn off functions like Bluetooth, the Web browser and even the phone's camera."The reason why you see such a long list of various policies and controls is because different organizations want those controls," says Adam Glick, senior technical product manager for Microsoft Exchange.He points to the peace of mind the system offers to people whose phones have been stolen, and who can rest assured that all the personal information contained inside can be erased from afar.Glick says employers sometimes need remote control of other functions, like the camera, to prevent leaks. "If you're having an important meeting about the future finances of the organization and people put that up on a slide, and someone might take out their camera phone and take a picture. And then they might go and, say, post that to the Internet," Glick says.But when companies exert that kind of control over someone's personal phone, things can get messy. Anthony Davis runs IT for a manufacturing company in Seattle, and he says he makes a point of letting people know that when they opt to get company e-mail on their personal phones, they're signing up for more than just e-mail."We actually have a one-page waiver that says, you know, if you're going to connect your personal phone to the corporate e-mail system, that we do have the capabilities if the phone is lost to remote wipe it — and we will — and then have the employee agree [to] and sign that form," Davis says.But companies often aren't that transparent about the power e-mail gives them over personal phones. And it's not just phones.IT administrators can send similar commands to iPads and other personal devices that get work e-mail. Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute, says he's not sure what a court would say about a company that wipes an employee's phone without permission.But he says he'd like to find out: "I'm salivating right now at the prospect of this lawsuit."Maltby says there's now a breakdown of the old paradigm that your company controls work devices and you control yours and "never the twain shall meet.""Now, you have this gray world in which everything overlaps, and everything that's personal is business and vice versa, and now it's a mess," he says.Putting work e-mail on a personal device may be convenient, but for Stanton it's no longer worth the risk.After restoring her iPhone — or, as she calls it, her "precious iPhone" — she says she'll never put work e-mail on it again.

Nokia announced Friday that its chief executive will step down and will be replaced by a veteran from Microsoft, as the Finnish handset maker continues to look to create a smartphone that can compete with Apple's iPhone.Nokia announced in a press release Friday that Stephen Elop, who is currently head of Microsoft's Business Division, will become its new CEO on Sept. 21. Elop will replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, the current president and CEO, who has served as the company's head sine 2006. In that time, Kallasvuo and Nokia failed to develop a smartphone that could challenge Apple's iPhone, and have seen their market share slip , even though they remain the largest handset maker in the world. But while Nokia retains the lion's share of overall worldwide handset sales, it is dwarfed by Apple in terms of profit. In May, Kallasuvuo even publicly admitted that his company has failed to make a splash in the U.S. smartphone market, while Apple has taken the industry by storm with the iPhone and its digital storefront for third-party applications, the App Store. The company's best smartphones have struggled to compete in the high-end market with the likes of the iPhone and handsets based on Google's Android mobile operating system. "The time is right to accelerate the company's renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success," said Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors. "The Nokia board believes that Stephen has the right industry experience and leadership skills to realize the full potential of Nokia. His strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company." Though Kallasvuo will officially resign as president and CEO on Sept. 20, he will continue to chair the Board of Nokia Siemens Networks in a non-executive capacity. His severance package will net him 18 months of gross base salary and target incentive, totaling about 4.6 million euros. He will also be compensated for the 100,000 restricted shares of Nokia stock he was granted in 2007, which fully vest on Oct. 1, 2010. "The whole board of directors joins me in thanking Olli-Pekka for his thirty years at Nokia, during which he has been deeply involved in developing the company and its operations," Ollila said. "His dedication and contribution throughout the years has been exceptional. The board wishes him every success in his future pursuits." In addition to competing in the smartphone market, both Apple and Nokia are entrenched in a number of lawsuits related to patents. The first shot in the legal battle was fired by Nokia last October, when it accused Apple's iPhone of violating patents related to GSM and wireless LAN technology. It is believed that Nokia's losses in the market prompted the company to sue over the alleged use of 10 patented wireless standards in the iPhone. Apple responded to Nokia with its own lawsuit , accusing the Finnish company of infringing on 13 iPhone-related patents. The battle of the two smartphone giants is expected to drag out for years, with both companies looking for a court hearing to be held in 2012. The U.S. International Trade Commission -- the group with which the complaints were filed -- has agreed to look into both Nokia's and Apple's complaints against the other.

Seeing Han Solo emerge as a frozen block of carbonite was probably the hardest thing for me to come to terms with when I saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time -- I was young and Han is the man. That image will forever be burned into my skull and now another fellow frozen in carbonite has a place up there too. His name is Steve Jobs.That’s right, someone decided to take the Apple’s head honcho and freeze him in carbonite! No not really, it’s actually an iPhone case made of flexible plastic -- not carbonite -- and it doesn’t come with a real Steve Jobs. However, it is probably one of the coolest and most creative iPhone cases I have ever seen! The $35 price tag matches up pretty well other cases out there but, those other cases don’t come with your very own frozen prisoner so there really is no comparison. There were actually a few models; one for iPhone 4, 3G and 3GS and there were skins if you didn't want a hard case.Unfortunately, it looks like Apple wasn’t very happy about the whole deal and they have sent the creators a cease and desist, which is a total bummer but we definitely saw it coming. The cases have actually been on sale since March and with the all the attention something like this will gain it was only a matter of time before they had to stop. Sorry for getting your hopes up, but it was just too cool not to write about. We’ll let you know if anything official spurs from this as a Han Solo in carbonite case would have the same level awesomeness.Related Posts: Review: HBO's Game Of Thrones Episode 2: The Kingsroad The Force Is Strong With America's Best Dance Crew's 'Street Kingdom'Discuss this story in our Movies/TV forums!

The New YorkTimes is out with the second installment of its iEconomy series, which explores high-tech manufacturing in an era of globalization. Not surprisingly, Apple, America’s top technology company, is a central focus of the series. The first piece came out last weekend and described why so many consumer electronics — including Apple’s iPhone and iPad — are produced in Asia: it’s vastly cheaper than building them in the U.S. Although outsourcing and the consequent demise of the U.S. manufacturing sector is a perennially hot political issue, the economics of globalization suggest that U.S. jobs lost to cheaper overseas competition won’t be coming back.Thursday’s article focuses on working conditions at factories run by Apple’s Asian contractors, including Foxconn, which produces an estimated 40% of the world’s consumer electronics. It paints a grim picture and raises questions about the effectiveness of Apple’s supplier code of conduct, which sets standards for labor issue and safety protections. Apple says that when it discovers violations, it requires improvements. But the article suggests there are limits to Apple’s influence over the sprawling factories run by its contractors. And the company has even less impact on company plants that supply its contractors.(MORE: $100 Billion Question: What Should Apple Do with Its Cash?)So will we see some kind of movement to boycott Apple products, akin to the campaign several years ago to pressure Nike to improve working conditions in its factories? Seems unlikely at the moment. “You can either manufacture in comfortable, worker-friendly factories, or you can reinvent the product every year, and make it better and faster and cheaper, which requires factories that seem harsh by American standards,” an anonymous current Apple executive told the Times. “And right now, customers care more about a new iPhone than working conditions in China.”Among the highlights (or lowlights) of the article:Employees work excessive overtime, in some cases seven days a week, and live in crowded dorms. Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk. Underage workers have helped build Apple’s products, and the company’s suppliers have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records, according to company reports and advocacy groups that, within China, are often considered reliable, independent monitors.(MORE: Apple Reports Record Profits on Massive iPhone and iPad Sales)Several high-profile disasters have occurred at factories run by Apple contractors:Two years ago, 137 workers at an Apple supplier in eastern China were injured after they were ordered to use a poisonous chemical to clean iPhone screens. Within seven months last year, two explosions at iPad factories, including in Chengdu, killed four people and injured 77. Before those blasts, Apple had been alerted to hazardous conditions inside the Chengdu plant, according to a Chinese group that published that warning.One former Foxconn manager offered a scathing assessment of Apple priorities:“Apple never cared about anything other than increasing product quality and decreasing production cost,” said Li Mingqi, who until April worked in management at Foxconn Technology, one of Apple’s most important manufacturing partners. Mr. Li, who is suing Foxconn over his dismissal, helped manage the Chengdu factory where the explosion occurred. “Workers’ welfare has nothing to do with their interests,” he said.“We’ve known about labor abuses in some factories for four years, and they’re still going on,” said one former Apple executive who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. “Why? Because the system works for us. Suppliers would change everything tomorrow if Apple told them they didn’t have another choice.” “If half of iPhones were malfunctioning, do you think Apple would let it go on for four years?” the executive asked.Apple declined to comment for the story. It will be interesting to see if this series spurs consumers to put any pressure on Apple to do more to improve conditions in its supplier factories.

Following a report from earlier this month that claimed Apple’s (AAPL) next-generation iPhone will launch in the first half of 2013, new claims have emerged from the Far East that further support a summertime launch for Apple’s next iPhone. Digitimes cites unnamed market observers in stating that a number of Apple’s component suppliers are looking forward to strong first-quarter performance ahead of two big product launches slated to take place by mid-2013.The first, Apple’s next iPad, would be pretty surprising considering the November 2012 launch of Apple’s fourth-generation iPad model. The second, which would be just as surprising considering Apple’s recent shift to an annual fall launch timeframe, is a new iPhone.Digitimes provides no details surrounding the fifth-generation iPad or seventh-generation iPhone, but earlier reports claimed Apple’s manufacturing partners have already begun trial production of the next iPhone in an effort to avoid the yield issues that have plagued Apple’s previous iPhone launches.

You may find it hard to believe, but it’s possible to capture 3D scans with your iPhone using just the screen and the camera. The solution comes in the form of an app called Trimensional.The way in which it works is very simple, but the results are quite effective as the video above and images below show.In order to work you need to turn the brightness right up on your iPhone display, then stand in complete darkness. Hold the phone screen up to your face (around 20cm away) with the Trimensional app loaded, and tell it to starts scanning.The end result is a 3D scan of your face with the quality depending on how dark you managed to get the environment you are standing in.Here’s the full feature list of the first version of the app:For $0.99 on the App Store it gives you a new way to capture images of yourself, friends, or random objects which you can then share with others over e-mail, or manipulate them directly on your phone.The Trimensional website states it works best with iPhone 4 or the latest generation (4th) iPod touch. So if you have a previous generation phone or iPod check the iTunes comments first to see if anyone got it working.One update we’d like to see to the app is the ability to export the 3D model in a standard format 3D art packages can handle.Read more at the Trimensional website

Sprint has been something of an underdog in the U.S. wireless space for years now, and while the iPhone has absolutely changed the course of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, it has only recently started to ship on Sprint . The first change Sprint had to grab the iPhone came at the iPhone 4S event in October 2010, and while the real numbers are murky, it's estimated that Sprint invested billions over a number of years to make that deal happen. That's a lot of scratch for a carrier that is struggling to maintain a user base, and shareholders are finally speaking up about it. According to Reuters, Sprint's CEO Dan Hesse has agreed to a pay cut after "coming under fire from some shareholders disappointed with the hit the company's results took from subsidizing Apple's popular iPhones." Hesse has said that his salary will be cut in order to repay around $346,000 in incentive pay that he has already received, and he'll also give up additional amounts that was previously eligible for. Here's Hesse's statement: "These voluntary actions regarding my personal compensation, which total $3,250,830, will eliminate any benefit for me to the discretionary adjustment the compensation committee made earlier this year." Yeah, that's a lot of money, but the move will still put him at a salary level nearly in line with 2010 levels, and Sprint still has a long way to go before that $15 billion bet on the iPhone proves worthwhile.

AT&T, O2 feels your pain. Like AT&T, the U.K. mobile services provider has seen its network overtaxed by Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone, particularly in London, where a massive surge in data traffic has been causing network congestion since summer.In an interview with the Financial Times, O2 CEO Ronan Dunne said the company has seen an 18-fold increase in data traffic since the beginning of the year, most of it driven by super-smartphones like the iPhone. “Where we haven’t met our own high standards then there’s no question, we apologise to customers for that fact,” Dunne said. “But it would be wrong to say O2 has failed its customers en masse.”Well, that’s one way of looking at it. The thousands of smartphone users who lost data service just a few days ago might see things a bit differently, though. Anyway, O2–like AT&T in the U.S.–is doing its best to contain the public relations damage arising from such outages. Dunne says the carrier has added an additional 200 mobile base stations in London to help it meet data demand and has been working with its infrastructure suppliers on network tweaks to improve data service.Wise moves. Best to act quickly and get out ahead of issues like these, which can become PR nightmares very quickly. As AT&T recently learned, network congestion issues make great fodder for the advertising campaigns of rivals. Wouldn’t want Vodafone (VOD) running its own version of Verizon’s (VZ) nasty “There’s a Map for That” commercials, now would we?

Whenever you hear about bugs and exploits being discovered in the iPhone’s browser, Safari, it’s usually the doings of some masterful meddler who devoted hours to unearthing any flaws they could find — not some user casually tapping around the application. Apple’s pretty good at keeping things locked down, and the iPhone’s got enough users that most of the nasty user-facing bugs have been flushed out. Well, except for this new one.It’s not an incredibly common bug, and it doesn’t seem likely that it would hit most users – but for the iPhone users this newly discovered bug does affect, it could mean huge operator fees.The flaw, as discovered by Estonian Apple Site AppleSpot: If the user visits a site which uses Motion-JPEG (most commonly used for security cams and live feeds) in Safari, Safari will continue to gobble up bandwidth even after Safari is closed. Safari is one of the few apps that Apple allows to process in the background, and Motion-JPEG streams appear to continue streaming, even if the stream is in another tab or in the “closed” application. Apple gives no indication that Safari will continue to stream – and considering that most applications on the platform aren’t granted such privileges, it’s unlikely that a lay user would understand the consequences.As mentioned, this bug certainly isn’t one that springs up all that regularly; for it to affect you, you need to not only visit one of these Motion-JPEG streams in Safari, but also be on some sort of pay-per-megabyte plan. While it’s no sweat off the backs of anyone on an unlimited package (as is the case with a vast majority of US iPhone users), it could work out to MASSIVE wallet damage for anyone traveling internationally or who are signed up on carriers that only offer metered data.The original discoverers of the bug claim to have been able to rack up over 740 megabytes in silently streamed data during one hour of testing. If the same thing had happened to someone without a data package, they say that one hour of unintentional data usage would have worked out to roughly 30,000 Estonian kroons in fees – or just shy of $3,000 dollars. Ouch.

Microsoft's Office for iPad, iPhone, and Android is a reality. Although Office Mobile has been rumored and reportedly spotted in the wild, Microsoft has remained persistently quiet about its plans for the product. The Verge has learned through several sources close to Microsoft's plans that the company will release Office versions for Android and iOS in early 2013.Office Mobile will debut in the form of free apps that allow Android and iOS users to view Microsoft Office documents on the move. Like the existing SkyDrive and OneNote apps, Office Mobile will require a Microsoft account. On first launch, a Microsoft account will provide access to the basic viewing functionality in the apps. Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents will all be supported, and edit functionality can be enabled with an Office 365 subscription.Microsoft will allow iOS users to purchase an Office 365 subscription within the app, or let organizations distribute codes to enable Office Mobile editing for users. The apps will allow for basic editing, but we're told this won't go very far in attempting to replace regular full use of a desktop Office version.A recent Microsoft press release from the company's Czech Republic subsidiary revealed that Office Mobile apps for Android and iOS would be made available from March 2013. We understand that Office Mobile for iOS will arrive first in late February or early March, with an Android version due in May.We reached out to Microsoft for comment on this story and a company spokesperson says "Office will work across Windows Phone, iOS and Android."

UPDATE: I have run out of promo codes, but really appreciate all the positive comments and support. If you have feedback, please feel free to email me at jacobu@gmail.com. I can only do some much QA testing on my own, and it's not until something gets into the hands of the masses that it can truly be torn apart :-D. I'll do my best to reply to all your messages and fix anything that needs fixing. I will release a bug fix version within a few days (+approval time, ~2-3 days), and will likely give out more free copies then. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.So for the last 2 months, I've been cranking away on an app called Aetherspark. It's a file browser, storage, and transfer system. It lets you mount your iPad as a disk from any OS (via WebDAV), transfer files to it, and browse them on the device. You can also upload and browse files on your device with a web browser. It even lets you send files between devices (even without wifi). Yes, it's a bit like AirSharing, but the interface is significantly different, and it has file transfer capabilities. It's also cheaper.Here are some demo videos Here's the app store linkI have 50 promo codes (most I can get per version) that I want to give out for a free download, so if you want one, please send me a private message and I'll give you one (if I haven't run out).I'm not only looking to get the word out about it, I'm also looking for feedback (both suggestions and problems you have with it).A slight caveat, the promo codes only work in the U.S. iTunes store. Nothing I can do about this unfortunately. :-(

With portable navigation systems hanging from millions of windshields and the price point of the popular devices diving down to the $99 mark, automakers’ expensive in-dash nav systems are going the way of the car phone. But with mobile-phone based navigation gaining ground — and the new 3-G iPhone expected to debut on Monday with full GPS capability — portable navs could soon face a similar fate.Phone-based GPS navigation has been steadily gaining ground on portables. Earlier this week, Networks in Motion, the leading provider of navigation services to the top four U.S. cellular carriers, announced that the day before Mother’s Day, May 10, saw the largest spike ever in the use of navigation on mobile phones, with nearly 5 million requests.That’s a lot of drivers finding their way to mom’s house. And looking at a small screen while driving.Portable navigation has experienced phenomenal growth over the past several years, while automakers’ expensive in-dash systems have been shown to increase the depreciation of a vehicle. But the use of GPS-enabled mobile phones isexpected to quadruple by 2011, and if GPS is introduced on the new iPhone, as expected, it could accelerate the shift away from portable nav systems. And as Popular Mechanics reported, leave GPS suppliers "scared %#*@-less." Portable nav heavyweight Garmin already introduced an iPhone-like GPS phone earlier this year, and last week minor player Mio unveiled two similar GPS phones. Now, all eyes will be on Steve Jobs on Monday when the Apple Godhead is expected to unveil the iPhone 2.0 with built-in GPS at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.The market is ripe for it. Networks in Motion, which claims to have a 57 percent share of U.S. revenue from navigation services offered on mobile phones, says that in early in 2007 it had less than a million paid users. Now it has more than 3 million, and in May it reached the milestone of more than 100 million monthly navigation requests.But the biggest challenge will be how to deal with driver distraction issues in moving from the small screen of portable navs to the even smaller screen of mobile phones.Let’s see if Apple will show the way.

Once the best of friends, Google and Apple have been warring for months now. First there was Apple's rejection of Google Voice from the App Store, which was soon followed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt stepping down from Apple's board of directors. And then let's not forget about Google positioning its Android OS to challenge the iPhone, Steve Jobs calling Google's "Don't be Evil" mantra bs, and of course, Apple indirectly going after Android by suing HTC for patent infringement.All in all, while Apple and Google still work closely on some initiatives, a new wrinkle in their relationship appears to manifest itself every couple of weeks. And now we have yet another example on our hands.The word "Google" is so ingrained as part of our everyday lexicon that it's now referenced as a verb more so than anything else - i.e "Did you Google it?" In fact, Google is so synonymous with 'Search' that in the current version of mobile Safari, where Google is the default search engine, users press a "Google" button after they've typed in their web query.  But those days appear long gone.In the new iPhone OS 4, the "Google" button has been replaced by a more generic "Search" button. Does this mean that Apple is indeed considering a deal with Microsoft whereby Bing would become the default search engine on the iPhone? Or maybe it's simply an indication that Apple doesn't want to give Google free branding promotion on the iPhone, even if it happens to be the default search engine.I, for one, hope Apple's hyper-competiveness regarding the iPhone and Android doesn't cloud their judgement to the extent that Bing becomes the default search engine on the iPhone. While Microsoft has certainly made some strides with their search engine offering, it simply can't compete with Google. At least not yet, anyways. The iPhone is all about quality, and it seems a bit backwards to push Google search aside when it's clearly the highest quality search engine available. While Google search would still be available as an option in a Bing/iPhone world, why make users wade into the system preferences to begin with?

Denied the opportunity to make the argument in court that the design of the original iPhone was derived from Sony concepts, Samsung has decided to make it in the court of public opinion. Moments ago, the company released to the media two batches of evidence excluded from the trial currently occuring in San Jose, Calif., along with the following statement:The Judge’s exclusion of evidence on independent creation meant that even though Apple was allowed to inaccurately argue to the jury that the F700 was an iPhone copy, Samsung was not allowed to tell the jury the full story and show the pre-iPhone design for that and other phones that were in development at Samsung in 2006, before the iPhone. The excluded evidence would have established beyond doubt that Samsung did not copy the iPhone design. Fundamental fairness requires that the jury decide the case based on all the evidence.A brazen statement, particularly the last line which seems to express hope that members of the jury will see the excluded evidence. But evidently Samsung’s legal team is not at all happy with the way the trial has progressed so far.Ahead of opening arguments on Monday, Samsung lawyer John Quinn asked the court to hear further arguments and allow evidence showing that Samsung designs for what became the P700 predate the iPhone. Judge Lucy Koh denied the request, saying that she had already heard three motions to reconsider the point and noting once again that the evidence had been excluded for good reason: it was introduced far too late in the discovery process.Quinn persisted, saying he was begging the court to hear more discussion, something he said he hadn’t done in his 30-plus years of law.“You’ve made your record for appeal,” Koh said. “Don’t make me sanction you, please.”Update: Apple’s legal team was quick to take issue with Samsung’s release of evidence excluded from the trial, saying the action was contemptible. Judge Koh was none too pleased with the move herself, calling for an immediate meeting with Quinn.“Tell Mr. Quinn I’d like to see him today,” Koh said. “I want to know who drafted the press release, who authorized it from the legal team.”

For some time now, rumors of the GPhone (or Google phone) have been circulating around the web.  While it didn't make a whole lot of sense that Google was going to get into the hardware business, especially the highly competitive handset business, it seemed reasonable that Google had an interest in the handheld market for obvious reasons, not the least of which is the huge potential in search.  Though, as we came to find out, it wasn't so much the hardware but the "platform" that Google was interested in.  Tomorrow (9/23) will bring a lot more clarity to Google's play in the handset business, according to Time , as the first ever Google Andriod operating system-based handset is set for retail availability with T-Mobile customers.  The T-Mobile Dream is go for launch.The sweetest part of the Dream is the Android Market — Google's answer to the Apple App Store. Whereas many Apple apps cost money (typically anywhere from $.99 to $9.99), at launch all Android Market apps will be free. That includes BreadCrumbz, a picture-based navigation program that doesn't just give you a drawing of your route, but also includes real-world photos to keep you on track. Another interesting app, TuneWiki, is a tricked-out music player that encourages mobile karaoke, by synchronizing written lyrics onscreen to the song's YouTube video.Let's see, open source, major player support in key enabling technologies like search and navigation, freeware utilities to the public --  Apple, you can be afraid now, very afraid.This video of the Android concept was published a little less than a year ago and it's still pretty impressive.  Now if they could just find a real service carrier, we'd be in business.

It's all kicking off: Apple has called an emergency press conference to address the controversy surrounding the iPhone 4 and its incredible shrinking phone signal.iPhone 4 has been plagued with controversy since it first arrived in customers' hands, and owners quickly discovered those very hands broke their new £500 phone. It may be the dog and bone everyone and their gran has heard of, tweeted about, and featured in a hilarious webcomic, but it divides opinion like few other tech products -- and has even led to a share price nosedive.Apple's official stance is that the reception issues are the result of a long-standing software glitch that displays the wrong number of signal bars. So far, Apple has refused to acknowledge the alleged hardware problems caused by wrapping the phone's two antennas around the outside of the phone.Fortunately, someone has seen the funny side: Microsoft COO Kevin Turner joked at the MS Worldwide Partner Conference that "the iPhone 4 might be their Vista". The wag! Wasn't so blinkin' funny in 2005, Kev.If you aresuffering an iPhone 4 signal catastrophe, Crave is here to help: we show you how to fix your iBlower with our patented CNET UK iPhone 4 super-reception stick. We've also rounded up a selection of our favourite iPhone 4 cases.So what will Apple announce? Look no further than Crave, as we'll be closely following the press conference. It all kicks off tomorrow, Friday 16 July 2010, at 5pm BST, as if we've got nothing better to do on a Friday night.Will Steve Jobs announce a recall? Will Gray Powell's head be served up on an iPad? Will there be free bumpers for everyone? Or will El Steve be slowly wheeled across the stage in a wheelbarrow full of money, impassively flicking the Vs?Tell us your predictions in the comments, or on our official Facebook page. And most importantly, tell us has Apple finally jumped the shark?

the dreaded words 'No Service' plague my iPhone's (beautiful) screen.i decide to take the SIM card out and place it into my eight-year-old Nokia 6100. i turn it on. and now i see 'O2 - UK' and a full 7 bars! i place a call. i hear it ringing. my friend answers. we have our chat. all is well. i hang up and, apart from the handset getting slightly warm, i'm happy.i don't know about you but I want my phone to be able to place calls first and foremost. everything else is secondary.so is my phone faulty or has technology really gone backwards at Apple? how would I convince them to give me a new phone or a refund? your thoughts would be appreciated.EDIT: I have tried switching 3G both on and off. I leave things like Push, Wifi, Bluetooth, Notifications, etc all off. I find it has bad reception generally whenever I go indoors and, even when I leave a building or come out of the underground, it takes a while for it to find a signal.

BEIJING (AP) — Foxconn Technology Group denied on Saturday that production was affected at a Chinese factory that makes Apple’s iPhones, although both state media and an overseas labor watch group said some workers halted production lines on Friday, apparently over higher quality control standards.China Labor Watch, based in New York, reported that 3,000 to 4,000 workers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou in central China went on strike Friday over increased quality control demands and having to work during an extended national holiday.The state news agency Xinhua, quoting a spokesman for the management committee of the Xinzheng Comprehensive Bonded Area where the plant is, said some production lines were halted Friday when workers persuaded quality inspectors to skip work to show dissatisfaction over higher quality standards.In a statement on Saturday, Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, said production at the Zhengzhou plant continued without interruption. It denied any strike or work stoppage.Foxconn said there were two isolated, small-scale disputes between production line workers and quality assurance personnel on Monday and Tuesday.Xinhua said some workers were unhappy when Apple strengthened quality inspections of the iPhone 5 after consumer complaints regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone. In the Xinhua report, the spokesman was unable to provide a specific number of workers involved.

Recently reunited German electro-punk spazzes Atari Teenage Riot are still causing controversy. ATR's iPhone app has been delayed by the German iTunes store due to a dispute over its content. The free app is set to feature every ATR album, song, and video, as well as photos, news updates, and more. But it also included something called "Riotsounds Produce Riots", an audio player that features sounds that ATR used at a May Day protest in 1999, at which the band members were arrested.According to a press release, those sounds include "very low sub basses, square waves, noise sounds which trigger hysteria and panic within the audience." So your iPhone could make a whole lot of people very uncomfortable, if hooked up to big speakers-- which ATR encourages, via press release.But Apple has held up the app's release while they investigate whether it's legal to release an app with all those noises on it. The band had hoped to get the app out in time for this year's May 1 protests, but that didn't happen.Responding to inquiries about the app's status, ATR mastermind Alec Empire writes, "Today's status is that the ATR iPhone will be released within the next ten days. The Riotsounds player might be added later with an update. It's a legal loophole. So not sure yet what the outcome will be. But the free app which includes all ATR songs and videos plus a lot of extras will still be pretty awesome, even if the Riotsounds player is not included in this version. ATR plans regular updates for the app including free bonus tracks, unreleased songs, outtakes and more."On May 24, the group will release the reunion single "Reactivate" on their own Digital Hardcore label.

First came the rumors. Then came the leaked images. And now, 3 all-knowing (conveniently unnamed) analysts have predicted that Verizon’s long awaited foray into Android will happen some time next week with the announcement of Motorola’s Sholes/Tao smartphone. The timing seems feasible, especially considering that Motorola is holding a MOTODEV Android-related press event next Tuesday, October 6 (WinMo 6.5 who?).But, this is far from certain, folks. In fact, we have it on good word that Verizon retail employees have yet to train on Android, making a near term launch that much less likely. However, that does not rule out an announcement only like the recent Motorola CLIQ event.Either way, the speculation is definitely heating up. Just this morning the friendly folks over at AndroidGuys have posted information suggesting the Tao (or whatever it will end up being called) will be released on December 1, just in time for the all-mighty holiday shopping bonanza. But the fun doesn’t stop there.According to the super secret document that found its way to AndroidAndMe, the Tao will purportedly be the “world’s thinnest” slider QWERTY phone at 13.7mm thick. Yes, please! Other juicy tidbits include: a 3.7? 16:9 touch screen display, 16GB built-in storage, 5MP camera with dual LED flash, full HTML browser with Flash support, and supposedly the next generation of Android, the big 2.0.Here are the rest of the leaked specs:

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

The iPhone 4?s screen may be the best mobile display yet, but its resolution does not exceed the human retina, as Steve Jobs claims.The math just doesn’t add up, said Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, who explained that the iPhone 4?s purported “retina display” was a misleading marketing term.“It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far,” Soneira said.During his keynote speech, Jobs said the iPhone 4?s display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. He claimed that this resolution exceeds the limit of the human retina, which Jobs said was 300 pixels per inch for a display about a foot away.“It turns out there’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch, that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes, is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels,” Jobs said.Soneira, who possesses a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton and has been studying displays for 20 years, said it was inaccurate to measure the resolution of the eye in terms of pixels, because the eye actually has an angular resolution of 50 cycles per degree. Therefore, if we were to compare the resolution limit of the eye with pixels on a screen, we must convert angular resolution to linear resolution. After conversions are made, a more accurate “retina display” would have a pixel resolution of 477 pixels per inch at 12 inches, Soneira calculated.He noted, however, that he was confident Apple will have the best phone display on the market. Like the iPad’s LCD display, the iPhone 4?s screen features In-Plane Switching technology, in which crystal molecules are oriented so their motion is parallel to the panel rather than perpendicular. For viewers, the result is a very wide viewing angle — up to 180 degrees — with brilliant color. Soneira added that we might not realistically need anything better than 326 ppi.For comparison, glossy magazines are typically printed at 300 dots per inch.Soneira said he wanted to highlight that “retina display” is a symptom of a larger problem of market puffery in the display industry. Basically, many manufacturers exaggerate claims about their display specifications — everything from resolution to viewing angle, and from brightness to contrast — and they have to do it because everyone is doing it.“The marketing puffery is now in control,” Soneira said. “Everything that’s being said now is just this superamplified imaginary nonsense, and the only way to get people’s attention now is making more outlandish statements.”For example, Soneira discarded Sharp’s Quattron TVs that claimed to display four primary colors (as opposed to the traditional three) as utter nonsense. He explained in an earlier Maximum PC guest article that all television and movie content is produced and color balanced in the traditional RGB color arrangement. Sharp Quattron’s fourth primary color is yellow, and there is nothing for it to do because yellow is already reproduced with mixtures of the red and green primaries, he said.“[Market puffery] hurts companies that make good products, like Apple, because they can’t really put the specs out because everybody is lying,” Soneira said. “If you and I have the world’s greatest display, and we launched it and put down the real scientific numbers, we’d go bankrupt because our numbers would look like the worst display being made.”

Not interested in waiting until the 23rd for Verizon's big announcement? Don't worry, we've got you covered right now! The Motorola Droid X has probably been one of the worst kept smartphone secrets in recent memory, but after spending two hours with the phone we sort of see why. In short, it's pretty awesome. Call it a superphone or a mega-smartphone, but the 4.3-inch handset is absolutely Verizon / Motorola's answer to the HTC EVO 4G , and makes the Droid Incredible look like a bench warmer. What do we mean? We'll let you see for yourself just after the break in a breakdown of exactly what this phone is all about -- and in a video or three of it in action. Oh, and on your way down, make sure to feast your eyes on the gallery, too. So here are our main takeaways: Pretty promising, isn't it? We should know more when we get an announcement toward the end of the month, but in the mean time, we're really excited about what Moto's got going on here. There have been conflicting reports on the Droid X's screen size. We're going with 4.3-inches for now. Sam Sheffer contributed to this article.

Under the radar of this week’s WWDC news is a small but very significant change to the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement. The change is in the oft-controversial section 3.3.2. Here is the last sentence of the old copy:Here is the new copy:Unless otherwise approved by Apple in writing, no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with Apple’s prior written consent, an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application.?I’ve said before that Apple’s aversion to interpreted code and external runtimes is the potential for someone else to take the platform over. That’s not the whole story, though. Games in particular tend to use engines and libraries that leverage interpreted languages such as Lua. Many of these applications pose no threat, neither implicitly nor explicitly.While explicit approval from Apple is still required, these new terms seem to acknowledge that there’s a difference between an app that happens to have non-compiled code, and a meta-platform. It’s a step that should allow for many new possibilities.

With Apple's top marketing executive on the stand and under oath, Samsung's lawyers attempt to pry out information about Apple's next iPhone.SAN JOSE, Calif. -- There's been no shortage of once-confidential Apple information spilling out recently, ahead of the Apple v. Samsung patent trial here. But with the proceedings in full swing, today could have brought the biggest revelation of all.During the cross-examination of Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller, Samsung's attorney tried to get the executive to talk about a product that hasn't been announced yet.In an attempt to get Schiller talking about design, Samsung attorney William Price asked Schiller whether Apple's next iPhone model would look anything like existing versions, or if changes were in store.Apple's legal team jumped up to object the question immediately, telling U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh that an answer would be divulging confidential information. After a brief pause, Koh overruled, saying she would let Price ask the question.Schiller, looking nervous, sought confirmation from Price of what had just been asked of him. Then he said, "I prefer not to tell confidential information about future products."Apple is expected to roll out a new version of the iPhone next month, per numerous rumors. That event is rumored to take place on September 12, by which time this trial will presumably be wrapped up.You can check out CNET's complete coverage of the trial here. And our roundup of iPhone 5 rumors is here.

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

UPDATE: Now It’s Personal: Apple ditches private investigator, personally taking on teen who sold white iPhone 4 kits > Read the breaking news here !A 17-year-old geek from Queens has turned the fervor for the unreleased white iPhone 4 into a six-figure business — enough to send himself to college, so long as he can stay out of trouble with the law.The unbelievable demand among Apple enthusiasts for the long-delayed white version of the iPhone 4 has been compared to the hunt for that legendary white whale, Moby Dick.So when Fei Lam, a high school senior and gadget nerd, got a tip about buying up some white iPhone 4 parts, he saw the opportunity to finally make his passion for electronics pay off.According to Lam, who speaks fluent Chinese, about six months ago he was able to make a connection with Apple’s infamous overseas supplier. “I knew a guy from a few years back that had somewhat of a relationship with folks in Foxconn,” Lam told The Observer by email.Lam created a site, whiteiphonefournow.com, to sell conversion kits that turn regular iPhone 4?s into their elusive white version.NEED A FUNNY SLIDE SHOW? CLICK HERE FOR : IF STEVE JOBS’ NECK COULD SEND HIM A TEXT MESSAGE, WHAT WOULD IT SAY?During the first month or so, Lam only sold one or two parts a day, and because he was getting the pieces himself, repacking and shipping them, he actually lost money.But he quickly figured out how to have the parts ship direct and his venture was noticed by major sites like TechCrunch, CNET and CNN, helping him to sell more than $130,000 worth of parts since this past August.“I’m very thankful, cause for months I was struggling for an idea that would bootstrap my first startup and help pay for college,” says Lam, who hopes to attend NYU and study computer science or business.Yesterday however, Lam received an ominous letter. “I got an email from a private investigator accusing me of selling stolen goods, which I’m 100 percent sure is not the case. They are some kind of anti-counterfeit/trademark firm, which sounds ridiculous, similar to what Apple is bringing up to remove White iPhone 4 Listings on eBay. I don’t know how this legal stuff works.”The consequences for selling stolen good online can be steep. In September a women in Kansas was convicted of selling stolen goods on eBay. She faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Lam intends to contact a lawyer and has no plans to take his site down or change his business. “There are a couple of other sellers online and somehow I’m the ‘focus’ of it all. I think this guy is just trying to scare me into stop selling on behalf of Apple.”He can take heart in the fact that Steve Jobs, along with his partner Steve Wozniak, helped to fund their first business selling “Blue Boxes” that let users make illegal long distance telephone calls.The Observer has reached out to Apple for comment.Read the thrilling part 2 of the Fei Lam story here: Apple ditches their P.I., now it’s personal!If Steve Jobs Neck Could Send Him A Text Message, What Would it Say?Can Joe Einhorn Build A Database of Every Object in the World?

Hey iPhone users: how many times a day do you take your beloved device out of your pocket just to check the time, change the tune, check email or see who's calling? What if we wore some kind of notification device on our wrists -- let's call them watches -- that could connect to your iPhone to do all of the above and more? And what if it didn't cost an arm and a leg?[More from Mashable: Snapstagram Wants to Print Your Instagram Photos [VIDEO]]Smart watches aren't exactly a new notion. In the past year we've seen and reviewed several: the InPulse, the WiMM One and the oddly-named I'm Watch. But they were all powered by Android, or connected to Android smartphones only.iPhone owners were out of luck -- until Wednesday, when a new smart watch by the guy behind InPulse (Eric Migicovsky, above) hit funding site Kickstarter. Dubbed the Pebble, it's the first smart watch that can form a meaningful, long-lasting relationship with your iOS device, as well as Android.[More from Mashable: 10 Waterproof Smartphone Cases to Prevent Disaster]And it's nothing if not popular. The Kickstarter campaign asked for $100,000 in funding; it got that in the first two hours. By day's end, the device had more than $500,000 in pledges.What's so smart about the Pebble? Well, for starters, it doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Other smart watches offer color screens as if they're trying to be a mini-smartphone. The Pebble lets your iPhone do all the heavy lifting. Its simple e-paper display -- much like the original Kindle -- is viewable even in direct sunlight, which is pretty necessary for a watch.It is also releasing its software kit to developers, so they can create their own iPhone app-linking apps. Out of the box, you'll be able to see incoming emails and calls, track your run and your bike ride via your phone's GPS, as well as use your watch as a remote for the music app on your phone.That feature alone seems worth the asking price -- which, by the way, will be $149.Check out the video below for more, and let us know in the comments: would you wear this?This story originally published on Mashable here.

As Verizon iPhone speculation heats up ahead of tomorrow's Verizon Wireless press conference, it appears that even rival AT&T can't keep its mouth shut.Yesterday, AT&T's vice president of communications, Larry Solomon, told Business Insider that "the iPhone is built for speed, but that's not what you get with a CDMA phone. I'm not sure iPhone users are ready for life in the slow lane."Several publications have taken Solomon's comment as proof positive that Verizon will announce the Apple iPhone tie-up tomorrow.Verizon hasn't commented on the trash talk, but this morning Verizon's policy blog editor John Czwartacki retweeted an article entitled "Rant: AT&T should shut up about Verizon iPhone."Does Solomon's claim have merit? If the Verizon iPhone confirms carriage on its legacy 3G network rather than its nascent 4G LTE network as most believe, then the answer is yes.Big Red may deliver more consistency and capacity than AT&T, especially in San Francisco and New York, but in PCMag's search for the Fastest Mobile Networks 2010 we found that AT&T performed faster than Verizon nationwide. It delivered average download speeds of 1.79Mbits/sec compared to Verizon's 1.01Mbits/sec.Instead of fighting speed, Verizon appears to be attacking the AT&T iPhone's Achilles' heel: capacity. Over the weekend the Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Verizon was "confident enough in its network" to offer unlimited data plans with the iPhone.

When it comes to smartphones, Apple's iPhone may be top of mind, but mobile devices with Google Android guts pose the biggest threat to Jobs and Co.According to a new market research study from Google-owned AdMob, the iPhone held about a 50 percent share of the global operating system (OS) market for smartphone devices browsing the internet in February 2010. While that statistic may not be surprising, AdMob found that Google Android is creeping up from behind, capturing about 24 percent of the market share. Nokia-owned Symbian placed third with 18 percent of the market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (RIM) and Microsoft Windows Mobile are left in the dust with a paltry 4 percent and 2 percent of market share, respectively, despite its solid smartphone sales.In the U.S., AdMob found that in February 2010 the Apple iPhone operating system held a 44 percent market share, down from 55 percent in November 2009; while Android's share rose in the U.S. from 27 percent in November to 42 percent in the most recent AdMob report.While Apple maintained a 50 percent market share globally, Google Android devices like the Motorola Droid, the Motorola CLIQ, and a slew of HTC handhelds like the Dream, the Hero and the Magic helped push Google Android to No. 2, according to the study results."Android was the fastest growing operating system in the AdMob network year-over-year," the study explained. "Android's share of smartphone requests increased from 2 percent in February 2009 to 24 percent in February 2010."The study, according to AdMob, illustrates that Apple iPhone and Google Android users take advantage of the mobile Internet more than users of competing devices.AdMob services mobile ads for more than 15,000 mobile Web sites and applications globally and stores and analyzes the data from every ad request, impression and click within its network and issues monthly reports based on that data to evaluate the mobile device and mobile Internet ecosystem.Other findings in AdMob's most recent study show that smartphones accounted for about 48 percent of AdMob's worldwide traffic in February 2010, which was up from 35 percent in February 2009. The increase in smartphone traffic pushed traffic from feature phones down. Feature phone use declined from 58 percent a year ago to 35 percent in February 2010.

Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch cancels his C4 programming conference in the wake of an Apple change he sees as stifling programming innovation.New restrictions that Apple added to its iPhone software developer kit have led an independent programmer to cancel a conference devoted to Mac programming and computer science.Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch announced Wednesday he canceled the C4 conference after four years organizing it because of new wording in a section of the iPhone OS 4.0 software developer kit."With resistance to Section 3.3.1 so scattershot and meek, it's become clear that I haven't made the impact I wanted with C4. It's also clear my interests and the Apple programming community's interests are farther apart than I had hoped," Rentzsch said.Central to the matter is the battle between Apple and Adobe Systems concerning Flash, an Adobe programming foundation widely used on the Web but banished from the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Apple further restricted even native applications originally written in Flash with new wording in section 3.3.1 of the iPhone OS 4.0 SDK, leading Adobe to cancel a Flash-for-iPhone programming tool as well. CEO Steve Jobs explained in a rare open letter in April, but his words didn't satisfy Rentzsch."By itself Section 3.3.1 wasn't enough to cause me to quit C4. I've weathered Apple lying to me and their never-ending series of autocratic App Store shenanigans. But unlike previous issues such as the senseless iPhone SDK NDA [nondisclosure agreement], the majority of the community isn't riled by 3.3.1. On this issue, Apple apologists have the loudest voice. They offer soothing, distracting yet fundamentally irrelevant counterpoints to Apple's naked power-grab."Rentzsch said he was motivated to produce C4 because he wanted to marry Mac programmers' "maniacal focus on user experience" with better low-level programming tools."I believed the best way to move software forward was to inform Apple programmers about better ways to build software--to infect the best top-downer minds with fertile discontent," he said. "My hope was that developers would care primarily about user experience yet also be passionate about utilizing lingual and tooling advances."Apple has thwarted that hope, though, with the new SDK license terms. Those read: "Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g., Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited).""Section 3.3.1 has broken my spirit," Rentzsch said. "Apple is crazy-innovative in terms of hardware and software design, but I can count the total number of software engineering advances they've made on one hand. Section 3.3.1 makes developers wholly reliant on Apple for software engineering innovation."Apple, which didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, has offered an explanation for the change to the programming tools license."We know from painful experience that letting a third-party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in substandard apps, and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third-party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features," Jobs said in his open letter. "We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers."

Yes, but what has France to say?Samsung is demanding the source code of the iPhone 4S firmware, while Apple wants copies of Samsung's contract with Qualcomm and both companies are looking to France in their Australian case.France is important, as that's where the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is based and where Samsung agreed to license critical 3G patents on a Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) basis. But, as Australian business title iTnews reports, Samsung reckons Apple is breaching three of its patents, while Apple reckons the Qualcomm chips it uses come with patent rights, so wants to see the contract Samsung has with Qualcomm.Samsung is seeking an injunction on the iPhone 4S in Australia, though the only patents it can apply are fundamental to the W-CDMA (3G) standard and thus fall into the ETSI-mandated FRAND policy. Apple reckons it is free to use those patents having bought chips from Qualcomm, and Qualcomm has a licence from Samsung which Apple has seen, but only in a form so redacted as to be useless to its case.Apple has previously argued that its licence to the Lodsys (mobile payments) patents should also cover users of its services (mobile developers taking payments through iTunes), so Cupertino obviously believes patent rights should be transferable, but that will depend on the contract Samsung has with Qualcomm, which is why Apple wants to see it.Samsung, meanwhile, wants to see the iPhone 4S firmware so it can establish that Apple really is breaching its patents, something Apple still denies.Samsung has tried to get injunctions against the 4S in America, France and Italy, where cases continue, with only the Dutch courts ruling in Apple's favour. Samsung is also pursuing a separate case though the Australian courts, involving the same three patents, and four others, in the increasingly impenetrable battle between the two companies.In this instance the judge reckons all these demands for documents mean the case isn't going to fit into the four-day schedule, and will start considering which of the various document requests should be sustained when the case continues on Friday. ®

If you’re someone who always ends up having to shell out extra money for your monthlycell phone bill because 1,000 anytime minutes just isn’t enough, there’s a solution for you (and, don’t worry, it does not involve talking less). VoIP (voice over internet protocol) phone systems no longer only pertains to the world voip business phone systems, and its advantages have now become available for the iPhone. If you’re familiar with VoIP phones, then you already know how cost-effective they can be for those who have to make frequent long-distance phone calls. Such savings can now be applied to cell phone use, and it is estimated by one company that offers VoIP for iPhones that people may be able to save up to 80% by using a VoIP application on their cell phone (Mobile Dev & Design).The iPhone has taken the capabilities of small business phone systems to a whole new level. Using the technology of a VoIP phone system (using Internet protocol to send and receive calls), users can now place long-distance or even international calls without having to worry about the charges. Internet phone systems, such as VoIP, are a much cheaper alternative to sending calls on your iPhone the traditional way – using your minutes.VoIP phone system companies now offer applications you can download to your iPhone which will give it the capabilities of ip phone systems. There are many applications available, however, some are more favored over others. Here are our favorites:has been given high ratings by such publications as The Times, The New York Times,and Stuffmagazine. This application is favored, in particular, because it allows users to search their iPhone’s contact list. In addition, calls are very clear, and can be made and received without delay.allows you to stay in touch with contacts on multiple networks, such as Skype, AIM, and MSN. iCall can be completely integrated with your iPhone, and works with a Wi-Fi connection. If you are using Wi-Fi and receive a call, you can easily switch over to your iCall application and save your minutes. Papaya and PennyTel are also VoIP applications for your iPhone.You also have the option of using web-based VoIP applications (which is kind of like using a hosted VoIP system in your office). Instead of downloading the application to your iPhone, you can simply log-in to your account online. JAJAH is one of the top web-applications, and looks like your iPhone’s dialing pad. Talkety, Raketu, and iPhoneGnome are also web-based.RingFree was one of the first VoIP services for your iPhone, and allows you to make calls using any VoIP service provider you choose. This application also allows you to make calls through an office phone system or virtual pbx.Now that you can use VoIP technology with your iPhone, ‘unlimited’ minutes has a whole new meaning. VoIP business phone systems have the capabilities to be even more mobile. The iPhone has taken softphone technology to the next level, allowing calls to be placed all over the world without having to pay the high cost. This is great for business travelers who need to be able to stay in-touch with co-workers or loved ones.Now you have more money for important things, like downloading the latest hit song to be your ringtone.

We all worry about personal safety. Chances are you have some form of self-defense on hand, just in case something happens. However, in the heat of the moment, are you really going to have it in hand and ready for use?The Yellow Jacket was created by a man who was attacked in his home. While he had firearms and a Tazer nearby, none of these items were within his grasp, which is what made him think about weaponizing his phone. Yellow Jacket is an iPhone case that comes equipped with a 650K volt stun gun, and is also capable of giving your phone an additional 20 hours of battery life. Not only can this save you from an attacker, but will also make sure your phone doesn’t die near the end of the day when you may actually need it. If you jump on this project now, it will only cost you $85, otherwise you’ll be looking at about $100.

The first day of the annual Pwn2Own contest in which security researchers can win cash and hardware if they successfully compromise machines using zero-day exploits is finished. Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7, Firefox 3 on Windows 7, Safari 4 on Mac OS X 10.6, and iPhone OS 3 were all compromised during the competition. Google's Chrome was the only browser left standing—and in fact, was completely untested. None of the researchers at the competition even tried to attack Chrome.So far, little is known about the successful exploits. Until vendors have been informed of the flaws and those flaws have been patched, details will not be made public.The iPhone was not successfully hacked in 2009's competition, but was predicted to fall this year, and those predictions have come true. A zero-day Safari flaw was used to gain access to text messages stored on the device by Vincenzo Iozzo from German security firm Zynamics and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg. Notable in the exploit was that it bypassed both iPhone's Data Execution Protection as well as its requirements that all code be signed.A little more is known about the IE8 exploit, including an (abridged) video of the browser being taken down. The successful researcher, Peter Vreugdenhil, has published a rough outline of the techniques used to bypass IE8's DEP and ASLR protections.The Safari hack came from Charlie Miller; this makes three years in a row now that Miller has pwned—and hence owned—a Mac at pwn2own. Thus far, nothing further about either this exploit or the Firefox one appears to have been published.Neither the iPhone exploit nor the IE8 exploit managed to escape the OS-supplied sandboxes that protect these platforms. Without escaping the sandboxes, the impact that flaws can have is reduced, preventing, for example, writing to hard disk (and hence, preventing installation of malware). Nonetheless, read-only access is still valuable for data theft.It is this sandboxing that might explain why Google's Chrome was untouched; no researcher even attempted to attack it. It is certainly not the case that Chrome has no security flaws—a couple of days before the Pwn2Own draw was made to decide who got to attack which machine and in what order, Google published an update to Chrome that fixed a range of security flaws, some of which were deemed to be high-risk. Google's sandboxing shouldn't be impenetrable, but it is sufficient to make the standard harmless exploit payload—starting up Windows calculator—harder to do.

People identifying themselves as representing Apple last week visited and sought permission to search the Silicon Valley address of the college-age man who came into possession of a next-generation iPhone prototype, according to a person involved with the find.“Someone came to [the finder's] house and knocked on his door,” the source told Wired.com, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is under investigation by the police. A roommate answered, but wouldn’t let them in.Apple’s vaunted wall of secrecy was smashed wide open when one of its developers lost a next-generation iPhone prototype sometime in March at a bar in Redwood City, California. Another bar patron took the phone home and, having failed to find the owner, gave tech news site Gizmodo exclusive access to the device in exchange for $5,000. Gizmodo eventually returned the phone to Apple, but not before it published numerous photos and details.San Mateo County police are now investigating, and they seized computers from Gizmodo writer Jason Chen’s home last week under a search warrant that Gizmodo is challenging as unlawful. Police have also identified and interviewed the man who took the phone from the bar, the reportedTuesday.News of Apple’s lost iPhone prototype hit the web like a bombshell, but it was apparently an open secret for weeks amongst the finder’s roommates and neighbors, where the device was shown around mostly as a curiosity. According to the source, who has direct knowledge of the Gizmodo transaction, the group of friends suspected this might be Apple’s new phone, but no one knew for sure.“There was no effort to keep it secret,” the source said. “There were a bunch of people who knew.”The finder attempted to notify Apple and find the owner of the device but failed, even going so far as to search alphabetically through Facebook, the source said. Thoughts then turned to contacting the press about the device to confirm its authenticity and help locate the owner, but early attempts to drum up interest went unanswered. After a few days with no response, the finder expanded the search.“The idea wasn’t to find out who was going to pay the most, it was, Who’s going to confirm this?” the source said.The finder at one point attempted to restore the phone by connecting it to a roommate’s Apple computer, but was unsuccessful.News accounts depicting the $5,000 payment as a “sale” are incorrect, this person said. Rather, the agreement with Gizmodo was for exclusivity only. “It was made very explicit that Gizmodo was to help the finder return the phone to its rightful owner or give it back,” this person said. “Gizmodo said they could help restore the phone.”Wired.com received an e-mail March 28 offering access to the device, but did not follow up on the exchange after the tipster made a thinly veiled request for money.

Hate going into AT&T stores and interacting with real humans? Worry not, as unlocking your AT&T iPhone is turning out to be a simpler process than expected for some users. The process can still be performed in-store by AT&T personnel, but it can also be done at home with the help of AT&T chat, Apple, and iTunes.We reported on Friday that AT&T would begin unlocking iPhones for qualified customers beginning Sunday, April 8. That was yesterday, and readers have begun reporting back with their experiences. As it turns out, all you really need is an active Internet connection and your iPhone's IMEI number to get started (you can get it from your iPhone under Settings > General > About). After logging into AT&T's website with your account credentials, you can then bring up AT&T's Wireless Support Chat where you can request your device be unlocked.As long as you meet the criteria—your phone isn't associated with an active-term commitment, you're out of contract, and your account is in good standing—AT&T will likely approve the request. But then it comes down to Apple, which has to push your unlock code to your e-mail address before you can proceed (this happens within 72 hours, but many users have said it took an hour or less). Once you receive the code, you must perform a backup and restore of the device through iTunes while tethered to a computer.As with most processes that are user-facing, the unlock process doesn't always work smoothly. AT&T's own documentation on the process points to this Apple support document on troubleshooting unlock issues, though there are a number of forum threads dedicated to discussing the nuances of performing the unlock procedure as well. Do you have any extra tips to offer for those who have yet to go through the process?Update: We have begun hearing that AT&T is making users call to initiate the unlock process instead of using the website chat feature. Still less effort than going into a retail outlet, but human interaction is somewhat required.
