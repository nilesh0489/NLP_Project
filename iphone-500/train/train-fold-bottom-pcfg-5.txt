A Microsoft executive on Wednesday took a dig at Apple and his own company, quipping that the new iPhone 4 might be as problematic for Cupertino as Vista was for Microsoft."It looks like that iPhone 4 might be their Vista, and I'm OK with that," Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner said during a keynote speech at the company's Worldwide Partner Conference, a video of which was posted online. "That's another mantle [Apple is] welcome to take. I actually read that headline last week and I just sort of had to smile after I did cartwheels, again."Vista is of course, the previous version of Microsoft's Windows operating system before Windows 7, which was plagued by bugs and generally viewed as a poor upgrade from XP.Turner made his comments while talking about Microsoft's efforts in the mobile space, and the company's upcoming launch of Windows Phone 7."One of the things that I want to make sure you know today is that you're going to be able to use a Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you're holding it to make a phone call," Turner said, referring to the iPhone 4 "death grip" issues.Turner acknowledged, however, that mobile has been a challenge for Microsoft. His speech comes just one week after the company killed its line of Kin social phones."This has been tough," Turner said about mobile.With the expected launch of Windows Phone 7 in late 2010, however, "we're back in the game," he said."When you look at this phone ? it's not like any phone you've ever seen from Microsoft, and I think that's a good thing," Turner continued. "We're re-booting ourselves in this area."Turner also discussed Apple's iPad. The tablet, he said, is "fabulous at content consumption, [but] lousy at content creation."As a result, most people are not going to dump their laptops in favor of an iPad at this point."They're generally a third device for most people. That's a fact and that's not going to change," Turner said. "Productivity matters and you can't maximize productivity if all you're doing is consuming content."

Apple continued to be on the losing end of a public relations battle Tuesday over a "Not Recommended" rating from Consumer Reports for its iPhone 4. Some industry watchers have gone as far as to suggest a recall is something the company may need to consider.The latest round of bad news was courtesy of Wayne State University Professor Matthew Seeger, who told Cult of Mac that the brand image of Apple could be at risk and said the company will be forced to issue a recall.Others told the Apple enthusiast site that the company needs to act with more urgency, calling Apple's response so far lackluster and even irresponsible. While there seems to be general agreement that Apple has responded poorly, some see a recall as too harsh a step.Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner said in a note to clients that he saw the risk of recall as low, saying the antenna issue was not serious enough to warrant such an action. He argued that Apple should be giving out free "bumpers" to those with problems, and wouldn't affect overall profit margins more than 1 or 2 percentage points.Apple charges $30 for these bumpers, which cover up the metal stripe. This keeps users from touching the lower-left hand corner with their hand, which seems to set off the reception problems.The company is also attempting to control the debate: Apple blog TUAW noted that it had found evidence the company was deleting threads in its support forum that referenced the Consumer Reports ratings at least a half dozen times."It's hard to imagine what Apple hopes to gain by doing this," TJ Luoma wrote.Either way, Consumer Reports' words are having a chilling effect on Apple's stock. In intraday trading Tuesday, the stock had fallen as much as 4 percent over the recall worries. Apple's typical silence on issues like this is probably not making the situation any better.

Web browser maker Opera topped the iPhone application download chart within 24 hours of releasing its free browser app.It has been downloaded 1,023,380 times since its launch on 14 April.It took three weeks for Apple to approve the program, which has already been developed for other mobile phone platforms.Opera Mini is not the first alternative to Apple's Safari to be developed for the iPhone.German developer Alexander Clauss launched an iPhone browser application called iCab in May 2009."It is probably the first well known PC browser to become available on the iPhone," said Forrester analyst Ian Fogg."There's no Firefox, no Internet Explorer - and there's not likely to be because of the development environment," he added."An app has to be written especially for a particular phone to offer a high quality experience. On many mobiles the browser provided with the phone is the only choice someone has."Opera has not developed a separate app for the iPad but says the iPhone program will also work on Apple's new device.Chief development officer Christen Krogh told the BBC that Opera's business model is similar to that of a traditional search engine, with revenue coming from affiliate deals and advertising rather than from the user."The web is still a place to make big bucks," he said. "Online ads are lucrative and that's growing on mobiles. The mobile ecosystem is becoming more like the web system."

This story was published in several major Canadian papers today. Atif Shamim, a Carleton engineering student has created an amazing new invention to prolong battery life in iPhones and blackberries. Read all about it.  An Ottawa inventor has pulled off something the titans of innovation behind the iPhone couldn’t — find a way to reduce power consumption of the “power-sucking” device to increase battery life.Atif Shamim, an electronics PhD student at Carleton University, has built a prototype that extends the battery life of portable gadgets such as the iPhone and BlackBerry, by getting rid of all the wires used to connect the electronic circuits with the antenna.Research on the invention, to be published in the upcoming edition of Microwave Journal, has already received international accolades.Last month, the article about the invention, co-authored by Muhammad Arsalan and adviser Langis Roy of Carleton’s department of electronics, was named the best paper at the European Wireless Technology Conference.The invention involves a packaging technique to connect the antenna with the circuits via a wireless connection between a micro-antenna embedded within the circuits on the chip.“This has not been tried before — that the circuits are connected to the antenna wirelessly. They’ve been connected through wires and a bunch of other components. That’s where the power gets lost,” Mr. Shamim said.He estimates his module consumes 12 times less power than the traditional, wired-transmitter module. It is also much simpler in design, lowering the overall cost of any hand-held device, he said.The judges at the European wireless conference lauded Carleton students’ paper for the “excellent integration of system design, material sciences and electromagnetic antenna design.” They also said the innovation is “highly relevant, with large potential for commercialization.”Mr. Shamim has filed patent applications in the U.S. and in Canada, in the knowledge consumers continue to gripe about the short lifespan of the iPhone battery.“It’s a common problem. There are so many applications in the iPhone, it’s like a power-sucking machine,” said Shamim.In June, 2007, Apple tried to answer critics who had given the iPhone low marks for its short battery life. Five months after unveiling the new product, the company announced the iPhone could now get up to eight hours of talk time, up from the five hours of talk time and 16 hours of audio playback at the launch.If an iPhone battery needs repairing, Apple will service it for $89, plus $10.77 for shipping for Canadian customers. All data on the iPhone is lost during the service, which normally takes three business days.Earlier this year, the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation honoured Mr. Shamim and Mr. Arsalan as student researchers of the year for their work in the field of wireless biomedical sensors. Also honoured was University of Ottawa student David Nadeau, for his contribution to the “more intelligent online search engine,” yooname.com

A new security hole has opened up in Apple Inc.'s iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, raising alarms about the susceptibility of some of the world's hottest tech gadgets to hacker attacks.Flaws in the software running those devices came to light after a German security agency warned that criminals could use them to steal confidential data off the devices. Apple, the world's largest technology company by market value, said Thursday that it is working on a fix that will be distributed in an upcoming software upgrade.With the security hole, an attacker can get malicious software onto a device by tricking its owner into clicking an infected PDF file. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security called the flaws "critical weaknesses" in Apple's iOS operating system.Internet-connected mobile devices are still subject to fewer attacks than personal computer, but they could eventually prove a juicy target for hackers because they are warehouses of confidential banking, e-mail, calendar, contact and other data.Software vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. What makes the latest discovery alarming is that the weaknesses are already being actively exploited - albeit in a consensual way.The latest concerns were prompted by the emergence of a new version of a program to allow Apple devices to run any software and circumvent the restrictions that Apple notoriously retains over software distributed through its online store. There are security risks of doing so, but many people find it liberating to install their own software.Although this program is something people would seek out, the weaknesses that its authors discovered could easily be used for malice, security experts say.There is an irony in the controversy: The site distributing the program offers a fix for the problem, but to get the fix, a user has to first install the program in question. So a user must defy Apple's restrictions to get the protection until Apple comes up with a fix of its own.Charlie Miller, a prominent hacker of Apple products, said it likely took months to develop the program to break Apple's restrictions, but a criminal might need only a day or two to modify it for nefarious purposes.Apple Inc. spokeswoman Bethan Lloyd said Thursday the company is "aware of this reported issue and developing a fix." She would not say when the update will be available.One reason for gadget owners to take heart: Attacks on smartphones and other Internet gadgets are still relatively rare. One reason is PC-based attacks are still highly lucrative. Still, vulnerabilities such as the ones Apple is confronting show that consumers should take care of securing their mobile devices as they would their home computer."These things are computers - they're just small, portable computers that happen to have a phone tacked onto them," said Marc Fossi, manager of research and development for Symantec Security Response. "You've got to treat them more like a computer than a phone. You have to be aware of what's going on with these devices."©2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

What's wrong with making the batteries bigger? The iphone, for instance, is already .37 inches wide. What's wrong with rounding up and making it .5 inches and fitting a bigger battery inside? Evo 4G has shitty battery life already, it's already as big as a brick, what is another .25 inches for the thickness? What about laptops these days. Even with dim use and most settings turned off, typing and listening to music won't get you more then 4-8 hours. All these manufacturers are saying "hey look, our gadget can go 7 hours without a charge" then it get's the consumer and those 7 hours are only with every possible setting turned off and lowest light settings as well. Why not make my laptop 1/2"-1" wider and fucking stuff a bigger battery inside? I don't give a fuck about how tiny your product is anymore. If the battery life sucks, FUCK YOU.

A TV ad for Apple's iPhone has been banned by the UK's advertising watchdog for misleading consumers after it over-hyped the internet capabilities of the smart phone.The ad showed the internet navigation prowess of the iPhone, with images zooming in on a weather forecast for Cape Town and a map of how to get to Heathrow airport."You never know which part of the internet you'll need ... which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iPhone," ran a voiceover.The Advertising Standards Authority received two complaints that the claim was misleading because the iPhone did not support Flash or Java, which are both integral to many web pages.Apple said the aim of the ad was to highlight how the iPhone can offer access to all websites, while many other handsets only offer lower-level access to WAP versions of sites or those selected by service providers.The US technology giant said that Safari, the web browser the iPhone uses, was built to open internet standards.Flash and Java technology were not open source, said Apple, adding that it could not ensure compatibility with "every third-party technology in the marketplace".The company said none of the content in the ad was Java or Flash-based and that the line "all parts of the internet" meant website availability, "not every aspect of functionality".Advertising pre-vetting service Clearcast said the ad had been given the green light for broadcast after a "demonstration and the advertiser's assurances".However, the Advertising Standards Authority said that claims made by Apple implied that "users would be able to access all websites and see them in their entirety".Because the ad had not explained the limitations of the iPhone, the ASA concluded that "the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iPhone".The ASA ordered that the TV ad must not be broadcast again in the same form.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

If you can’t be bothered to wait for the iPhone 5, then how about this?A German engineer has created a 10 times scale version of the iPhone 4 with a 40 inch screen which offers iPhone-esque computer functions - but also doubles up as a table.The ‘iTableous’ has exactly the same design as the Apple mobile right down to the on and off buttons, the camera and the accelerometer.It is covered by 8mm strong plexiglass and can flip onto its side to make using it more easy.But before you start placing your order, be aware that the iTableous isn't quite as hi-tech as it might appear. It does not have a touchscreen and can’t even be used to make phone calls.Its creator Benjamin Bachmeier has admitted that it functions more like a desktop computer, although it can connect to the Internet via wireless 3G.The iTableous is 118cm long and 58.9cm wide, around 10 times larger than the iPhone 4, which is 11.5cm long and 5.8cm wide.It uses a 40inch 920 x 1080 Toyota LCD monitor instead of a touch screen - so while you can't control it with a finger-swipe, it is at least satisfyingly large.Users operate the computer using a keyboard and a mouse sitting on or next to the screen.Just like a real iPhone the speakers are at the bottom of the case, only these ones are powered with a subwoofer, two mid range tweeters and two other speakers.The Home button does not work but lifts up to hide a 30-pin connector - so you can connect devices, including, oddly, a real iPhone.The iTableous runs off Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6.7 and has a 500GB hard disk and 4GB of RAM being powered by a GHz Zotac Ionitx processor.At the top just where the camera should be Mr Bachmeier has installed a 5.7-megapixel HD camera right which allows video conferencing when connected to the Internet.He has also converted what is normally the sleep button to a giant power switch.Other parts include a flap which appears to be a giant SIM card cover, but actually opens up to let you look at the circuitry inside.The connections include a line-in port, one USB 2.0 port as per an Apple computer, a SuperDrive, two HDMI ports and a DVB-T antenna cable.The swinging function flips the entire device 90 degrees on its side so the user can sit on the floor whilst using it.The other alterations include four internal fans plus an additional one Mr Bachmeier has fashioned himself to reduce the noise of the computer.

Somewhere around 95 percent of iPhone users who download an application from Apple's App Store stop using it after less than a month. Are iPhone apps just not that compelling?Just 30 percent of people who buy an iPhone application actually use it the day after it was purchased, according to Pinch Media, which analyzed over 30 million downloads from Apple's App Store. And the numbers plunge from there: after 20 days, less than 5 percent of those who downloaded an application are actively using it. The drop-off is worse for free applications.Those are amazing numbers. It's not a new pattern--GigaOm and TechCrunch noticed this last August--but back then, with the App Store just a month old, it was hard to know whether that usage model would last.Now it's clear that seven months, 15,000 applications, and 500 million downloads later, things haven't changed. App Store activity continues to be huge; Apple has made the App Store the centerpiece of its iPhone marketing over the last few months, highlighting the breadth and depth of applications that are available on the App Store for business and entertainment.But if most people don't find iPhone applications very compelling, does it matter how many exist? It's enough to wonder if the App Store is starting to get a bit saturated.Pinch Media CEO Greg Yardley looks at it a little differently. In his view, Apple has built such an easy-to-use distribution (as well as payment processing) platform for iPhone applications that people find it very easy to move onto the next thing that catches their fancy. The lack of a "try-before-you-buy" feature means iPhone users have no choice but to take the plunge, and given that most iPhone applications are free and the ones that do cost money are very inexpensive, there's little incentive to carefully shop around for the one application that best meets your needs.Only about 10 percent of iPhone applications appear to retain an audience over time, and most of those are games, entertainment applications such as movie listings, and things like Facebook ("their user sessions must be off the charts," Yardley said).But developers are still making plenty of money from the other 90 percent, he said. As noted, people are very willing to try new iPhone applications, meaning that building a better mousetrap is still a very viable business model for the world of mobile computing. His advice for developers is to get your money up front, and charge something for your application rather than trying to depend on a free/ad-subsidized model, because the number of people viewing those ads will plummet the day after the application lands on their iPhones.At some point, however, Apple will need to find a better way to help developers promote their applications within an ocean. "The App Store fails as a promotional mechanism. There's only so much screen real estate" that Apple can use within the App Store window to promote applications, Yardley said, and if you don't get on those Top 100 or Staff Favorites lists, your application languishes.Yardley thinks there is still a great deal of opportunity for developers on the App Store, which isn't that surprising given he makes his living by advising iPhone developers. And it's true that if the installed base of iPhones continues to grow, there will be more and more niche opportunities to cater to the needs of high-school students and seniors, and everyone in between.Still, how many more currency conversion (37), recipe (67), and fart-joke (30) applications do iPhone users really need, especially if they aren't using the ones they've already got?

So word on the street (literally) is that a large number of people are queuing in line outside of Apple's flagship store on 5th Avenue in New York City (see above) -- keep in mind the Cube is open 24 hours a day. Our intrepid girl-on-the-scene reports that the group is more than 60-deep, though most people seem confused about what they're waiting for, while some believe they're actually camping out for a 3G iPhone. Meanwhile, Apple reps tell us they're crowd-controlling iPhone buyers because otherwise they would be "screaming" at employees and clogging up the store. See what happens when you get short on stock? More pics after the break. For those of you convinced this is an Improv Everywhere stunt, here's a post from Charlie Todd -- the group's founder -- denying involvement.[Thanks, Laura and Abiade]

Apple, never one to tolerate much controversial content in its precious app store, has joined the long list of companies cutting ties with WikiLeaks. An application that offered iPhone users access to WikiLeaks’ daily trickle of formerly-secret diplomatic cables has been removed from the app store with little explanation, as TechCrunch first reported.Igor Barinov, the developer of the app, confirmed to TechCrunch that his $1.99 program had been pulled from the store, though whether that banishment was due to WikiLeaks’ political controversy or some other element of the app still isn’t clear. I’ve contacted the company for comment and will update if I hear back from them.Update: Trudy Muller, an Apple spokesperson, says that Apple  “removed the Wikileaks App from the App Store because it violated our developer guidelines. Apps must comply with all local laws and may not put an individual or targeted group in harms way.”You can still see a cached version of the banned app here.Android, meanwhile, continues to allow half a dozen apps that offer access to WikiLeaks’ content, some for free. I’ve written to Google to ask whether it plans to take any action to block those apps. If it does, it can expect a serious backlash from users who expect a more liberal approach to their content and will no doubt cry foul over any censorship.It’s no surprise that Apple, with its restrictive policies on content, wouldn’t tolerate the hosting of content that the U.S. government has declared stolen goods. Amazon Web Services, a far more tolerant platform, exiled WikiLeaks from its data centers two weeks ago, and financial firms have moved to choke the company too, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and most recently, Bank of America.The ability to scroll on your phone through thousands of raw cables written in stuffy diplomatic language is hardly a privilege most users will miss–after all, they can still access the Guardian and the New York Times apps, where the same information is being parsed and delivered in a much more consumable form. But WikiLeaks will serve as a free speech litmus test for every company in its orbit. And it’s already shown just how little the likes of Apple and Amazon care about users’ access to information.

Back in my day, piracy and filesharing was sketchy as hell. You would have to dig around on sites that very clearly compromised your security, you had considerably fewer choices in what to download, and cracking software was considerably more difficult. To the point, at least, where someone with less-than average computer skills would not even attempt to crack it, or would get their computer messed up.I remember a time when cracking your gadgets was difficult. Yes you followed instructions from the internet, but there was always a chance it would work and you would break your system. This kept a lot of people from doing it.Now, I have no problem with piracy when it's piracy, but honestly it isn't piracy anymore. It has become sterile and bland. Piracy was named piracy because back in the day, it was like being a pirate! Back then you were a swashbuckling, risk-taking corsair who lived on the edge. It wasn't only getting you the files you want for free, it was god damn exciting. But what has it degraded to? Now everyone has become a pirate. It is the norm. Because everyone is a pirate, pirating has become easier. Have you looked at instructions to "jailbreak" your iphone recently? It's basically one button. And downloading cracked software for that same iphone? I witnessed someone open a professional-looking iphone menu on their cracked phone, and download a brand new game (wich should have costed some money) absolutely free. No hassle, no workarounds, just touch to install. I was disgusted. Piracy should only be accessible to pirates. Your computer illiterate grandmother should not be able to download and crack photoshop. 10 year olds shouldn't be able to jailbreak their iphones and illegally download games people worked hard to make, before they're even old enough to realize what they're doing.Bring piracy back to what it was, something naturally somewhat difficult and slightly risky. Because not everyone should be a pirate. Yar.Edit: Added linebreaks to my "Whining spiel", just for you Paranoir

In the wake of Apple's decision to relax restrictions on the tools its developers can use, Adobe announced Friday that it would resume development on Flash for the iPhone.Adobe "will now resume development work" on its Packager for iPhone for future releases, Adobe wrote in a blog post. The feature is part of the Flash Professional CS5 authoring tool.In April, Adobe announced that it would no longer invest in iPhone-based Flash development after Apple banned private APIs and required apps to be written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine."Essentially, this has the effect of restricting applications built with a number of technologies, including Unity, Titanium, MonoTouch, and Flash CS5," Adobe principal product manager Mike Chambers said at the time. "While it appears that Apple may selectively enforce the terms, it is our belief that Apple will enforce those terms as they apply to content created with Flash CS5."On Thursday, however, Apple reversed course and said it would relax all restrictions on the development tools used to create iOS apps, as long as the resulting apps did not download any code."This is great news for developers and we're hearing from our developer community that Packager apps are already being approved for the App Store," Adobe said. "We do want to point out that Apple's restriction on Flash content running in the browser on iOS devices remains in place."Apple and Adobe have not exactly been on the best of terms lately. They got into a very public spat earlier this year when Apple CEO Steve Jobs posted a note on the Apple Web site that said Apple products would not include support for Flash because the technology is closed, unstable, and antiquated. Adobe responded by saying it would focus its attention on Android apps.Adobe reiterated its commitment to other platforms Friday."Adobe will continue to work to bring full web browsing with Flash Player 10.1 as well as standalone applications on AIR to a broad range of devices, working with key industry partners including Google, HTC, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, Palm/HP, RIM, Samsung and others," the company said.

I'm currently with sprint for cell phone service, and have been pretty happy all things considered. It's about time for me to renew, and I'm pretty annoyed by their new $10 premium data charge.I was thinking about going with AT&T, and getting an iPhone with no text messaging plan, although I do text quite a bit. With the included minutes and data package, it would be $48.99/month (this is factoring in a discount of approximately 15% through my work).My thinking was that I could simply start using my Google Voice number as my primary number, and pretty much stop using my current cell number entirely, so as to have free texting. I just started thinking of this today, and was just wondering if anyone had any experience with this or any input as to why this would or would not work.Thanks, I really appreciate any and all input!

I called AT&T's retention department today because paying 120 a month when I only use about 2mb of data on my iphone and half my 1,500 minutes a month seemed pretty high. But I ended asking about keeping my unlimited plan if I upgraded to the iphone 4 and if I could tether it. Surprisingly I could! Then she did some research and found out I could if I paid 30 extra a month with a 5 gig cap on the tethering. So my bill would be 150 for for my phone and internet that at best is on a highly reliable network. Sprint's HTC Evo 4 with 69 a month unlimited +10 for 4g is looking pretty fucking awesome right now... and I can tether for a one time fee of 10 bucks, just for the app. AT&T and their Iphone are priced so far out of the market place that I cannot see myself being an AT&T/Iphone user for much longer.tl;dr: Fuck the Iphone 4, 150 a month to tether vs. the HTC evo 4 @ 79 unlimited plan plus a 10 flat fee for tethering.

Dear iPhone 4 Users, The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in Apple's history. It has been judged by reviewers around the world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them. Here is what we have learned. To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design. At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our own experience and testing. What can explain all of this? We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising. Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display 4 bars when we should be displaying as few as 2 bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place. To fix this, we are adopting AT&T's recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the iPhone's bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a given area. We are also making bars 1, 2 and 3 a bit taller so they will be easier to see. We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been present since the original iPhone, this software update will also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G. We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same- the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused. As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund. We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do. Thank you for your patience and support. Apple

Last week’s revelation that Apple iPhones and Google Android-based smart phones were retaining locational information generated howls of protest from privacy advocates and government officials. Concerned that mobile devices were tracking our digital footsteps, many wanted “steps to be taken” to address their worries.Some of the concerns raised about the retention of locational data are valid. But panic, prohibition and a “privacy precautionary principle” that would preemptively block technological innovation until government regulators give their blessings are not valid answers to these concerns. The struggle to conceptualize and protect privacy rights should be an evolutionary and experimental process, not one micro-managed at every turn by regulation.Regulation should enter the picture only when companies break the promises they make to consumers or engage in deceptive practices. If serious harm has come to someone because of data disclosure, the Federal Trade Commission already has the power to crack down on companies, or lawsuits and class actions can be pursued.The data collected on Apple phones was brought to light after some computer science geeks unearthed a file buried on iPhones that can only be read on a computer that is syncing with the user’s device. This means the most likely snoop of your data would be someone already known to you. This could be a problem when an abusive spouse is involved, but in most circumstances, this is likely not a serious issue.Government access to locational data, however, is a more significant issue. Governments possess unique powers the private sector lacks, such as taxation, surveillance, fines, and imprisonment. Indeed, the Obama administration is asking the Supreme Court to rule that the police can surreptitiously attach GPS devices to your car and track your movements—without a warrant or oversight of any kind. Meanwhile in Michigan, police are downloading the entire contents of citizens’ smartphones — including geolocation information, emails, texts, and call histories — when stopping them even for routine traffic offenses.People genuinely concerned about privacy should focus their attention on these state-sponsored abuses and how to limit them. Congress should update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 to ensure adequate safeguards against unwarranted snooping by the law enforcement and a subpoena process that places a high bar on government access to phone records.Some critics worry about companies using locational data for advertising or marketing purposes even though that doesn’t happen much today. Even in this case it is unclear where the harm lies. If our phones know we are walking by an ice cream parlor and the store’s owner is offering free scoops to nearby consumers who find the shop with their phones, that seems like a benefit, not a harm.After all, while for some privacy trumps all other considerations, for others locational data provides the services they expect.  For finding the location of an appointment, seeking out a restaurant in a new neighborhood, or networking with a friend, geo-location is a “must-have” feature on digital devices.Optimally, companies should get clear consent before any “tracking” features collect data about user whereabouts. But in practice, consent can be tricky. What data does the user own? What data do those who provide us with innovative (and often free) services own?

This is most the obvious and the most packed with irony, given that Apple is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/24/apple-samsung-lawsuit-verdict_n_1829268.html?1345857263&utm_hp_ref=technology" target="_hplink">suing</a> Samsung in every country it can. The new, larger iPhone -- with a 4-inch display vs. the 3.5-inch display on all older models -- is closer in size to the 4.8-inch span on the Galaxy S III's screen. Was Apple's decision to up the iPhone's screen real estate a response to the popularity of Samsung's plus-sized and popular handsets?Google, which makes the operating system the Galaxy smartphones run on, is also embroiled in spat with the iPhone maker. Apple snidely decided to make <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/11/apple-debuts-maps-app_n_1587726.html" target="_hplink">its own map app for iOS 6</a>, which ships on the iPhone 5; Google Maps won't be preloaded onto iOS 6 devices. (Users can still go to the App Store and download it themselves.) Apple touts Maps as being <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/" target="_hplink">smooth and responsive,"</a> implying that Google Maps left something to be desired.So the new iPhone can take panoramic photographs, huh? Where have we seen that before? Oh right: Both HTC and Nokia smartphones. Nokia's new Lumia 920 comes with a camera setting that lets users <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57510802-233/iphone-5-vs-galaxy-s3-vs-lumia-920-by-the-numbers/" target="_hplink">create panorama shots of their surroundings</a>; HTC Windows Phones have come with a similar tool into the camera software "for some time now," <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44983/nokia-creative-studio-for-windows-phone" target="_hplink">according to Pocket-lint</a>. (Image courtesy of Apple.)Another nifty photo-related feature of the iPhone 5 is the ability to seamlessly share pictures with your friends. "The Shared Photo Streams feature is arguably the most practical addition, since previously sharing photos by email limited users to sending 5 photos at a time," <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-panoramic-photos-better-photo-sharing-in-new-iphone/" target="_hplink">explains TechCrunch</a>. "MMS'ing photos is also not ideal." But text and email's limitations haven't stopped iPhone users from sharing photos. Instagram didn't get to 100 million users by being a bad alternative for publishing mobile pics. There are also plenty of photo-sharing app out there, with smaller but devoted user bases than Instagram's.

Sprint's policy is to have the iPhone 4S SIM locked to our network domestically and internationally. At launch, the International SIM will be unlocked. We do expect a SIM lock to be pushed to the devices shortly after launch. We will then allow existing customers in good standing to unlock the SIM for international use if needed in the future. Customers can sign up for one of our international rate plans and use this phone all over the world. When traveling internationally, there is a setting that must be turned on within the device to connect to GSM. The phone will work with a SIM that is provided within the device out of the box. International voice and data charges are on a pay-as-you-go basis and vary based on the country where the customer is using their phone; a list of rates is available at www.sprint.com/international. Sprint offers two international voice plans that customers can subscribe to for discounted voice rates: * The Canada Roaming add-on is $2.99 per month and all calls placed from Canada are only 20 cents per minute. Without this add-on, calls from Canada are 59 cents per minute. * The Sprint Worldwide Voice add-on is $4.99 per month and offers discounted rates in countries around the world. For example, calls from Italy are $1.69 per minute with this add-on or $1.99 per minute without the add-on; calls from Peru are $2.29 per minute with the add-on or $2.49 per minute without it. Sprint does supply notifications of data roaming charges to protect customers from high costs. Notifications are sent to the customer's preferred method, either text or email, and are sent once the device exceeds approximately $50, $250, $500 and $1,000. To protect the customer from additional charges, the device's international data roaming capability will be suspended after the customer exceeds approximately $1,000 of international data charges in a billing cycle.

Last night, Google added Google Earth to its arsenal of iPhone / iPod Touch-invading apps and all we can say is wow. We imagine 99% of BGR readers have at least played with Google Earth on a computer at some point but for those few who aren’t familiar, it’s an application that lets you look at… The Earth. You know, like satellite view on Google Maps but waaay more intense. The video above is from Google’s release announcement and it goes through a variety of cool functions that are accessible. The movement and zoom are insanely smooth and clear on the iPhone’s display and that tilt feature is pretty sweet as well. Even if it is just a novelty for most, it’s still one of those must-have apps for when people annoy you with, “what’s so cool about the iPhone anyway?” The app is free of course and you can snag it in iTunes by hitting this link (phobos / iTunes link alert) or by searching Google Earth on your device.

Dan Wooley survived under the rubble of a hotel in Haiti after the earthquake by consulting a medical iPhone app to treat his wounds. " />Dan Wooley survived under the rubble of a hotel in Haiti after the earthquake by consulting a medical iPhone app to treat his wounds.The Best Reason to Have an iPhone YetUsually, when someone says their iPhone is a life saver, they are talking about the phone helping them find a good takeout spot or an emergency bathroom.When Dan Woolley says it, he really means it. He used a medical app saved on his phone to treat a leg injury after the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince collapsed around him.Woolley, who is from Colorado Springs, is one of the Americans who survived the massive earthquake that hit Haiti last week, and he did it with an iPhone application. Woolley is now recovering at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, but it was his fast actions with the app that may have saved his life.Woolley used the light from his iPhone to show him his injuries and diagnosed it properly as a broken foot. Then, he used the instructions from the app to treat the excessive bleeding from cuts on his legs and the back of his head.Woolley used his shirt to tie off the three-inch gash that was opened on his leg and a sock to bandage the back of his head. He said he also looked up ways to stop from going into shock."I kind of had some time to do some self-diagnosis down there," Woolley said. "God was with me."Not bad for a film producer who was in Haiti filming a documentary on efforts to help the nation's poverty-stricken children.Woolley also used his camera to take pictures of the surrounding rubble to piece together a way out. He eventually took refuge in an elevator shaft until rescue crews found him 65 hours after the earthquake."I took pictures all around me, then I would hold up the back of the camera to me and I could see what the picture was of a little," he said. "I was able to find an elevator in one of the pictures and that is where I decided to hobble to be in a more safe location."On Tuesday, Woolley told The Today Show he knew he was going to die and decided to write a journal on his notepad to his wife and young kids in the event someone found his corpse under the rubble."I was in a big accident. Don't be upset at God. He always provides for his children even in hard times," Woolley wrote in the dim light. "I'm still praying that God will get me out but he may not but He will always take care of ya."

AT&T has issued a press release today announcing that MMS will become active for iPhone users on September 25.We've been working for the past several months to prepare our systems and network to ensure the best possible experience with MMS when it launches - and that launch date is: September 25 for iPhone 3G and 3GS customers. MMS will be enabled through a software update on that day.AT&T points to the need for the company to build out its network infrastructure to handle the demands of heavy MMS messaging volumes as the primary reason for the delay in launching the service compared to carriers in other countries that have offered MMS since the launch of iPhone OS 3.0 in June. As announced in June, MMS messaging will be included at no additional cost to users with an iPhone text messaging plan. There has been much speculation on the availability of MMS from AT&T, some with dubious origins . Next week's Apple media event had been the subject of some speculation as a possible venue for AT&T to launch MMS, which was first promised at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June, though today's news has put all such rumors to bed.

A day after converting the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full-fledged release, Skype pushes out updates to its Windows software and its iPhone app.Updated on July 2, 2009, at 9:02 a.m. PT with more from Skype regarding push notification for the iPhone/iPod Touch app.Skype is certainly on a roll this week. Just yesterday it converted the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full-fledged release. On Tuesday, the VoIP company did it again for Skype 4.1 for Windows. In addition, Apple green-lighted Skype 1.1 for the iPhone and iPod Touch, which you can download now.Skype 4.1 beta brought back features like accessibility, birthday reminders, and the capability to send a contact record to another contact. These had been left out when Skype first updated its interface to the 4.0 style, the company citing a wish to get core features out the door before piling on the extras. It's these extras that users nevertheless clamored for. This minor point update also contains a major new feature that was first introduced in Skype 4.1 beta: screen sharing.Screen sharing initiates a video call, using the technology to broadcast a recording of your screen--either a portion or the full screen--to one other viewer. Screen sharing has some limitations: you can't simultaneously see a video of your buddy and their desktop, and since only one viewer at a time can peep at your screen, you can't use it as a free replacement for collaborative Web conferencing. It doesn't help that the picture quality is still choppy and fuzzy, in both partial-screen and full-screen view modes.Make no mistake, though: it's a great feature that we're happy to see added, but we'll be even happier to watch it improve.In addition to screen sharing, Skype 4.1 lets you feed a contact search from outside address books, including those in Gmail, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Microsoft Outlook, and a host of other players. If you have it installed, the Web toolbar will highlight phone numbers within contact lists so you can call them through Skype.Skype 1.1 for iPhone and iPod Touch reintroduces the capability to listen to Skype voice mail and to send and receive SMS messages. These features had been available on the desktop version, but were not activated when Skype first came out for iPhone.There are a few visual tweaks, also, which gloss up the look and feel of a few screens, most notably the dial pad. To top off the changes, this iPhone update pours on multilingual support, making it available in Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, and Traditional Chinese.Skype for iPhone still has far to go if it's to get all of the extra features that round out the Skype experience--games and conference calling are but two. Push notification is another that Skype users are now asking for. Skype told CNET that they wanted to first integrate SMS and voice mail, the two most-requested features. As for push notification, Skype isn't making any commitments at this point, but a representative from the company vaguely stated, "Where we're able to use functionality provided by the iPhone OS to support a rich Skype experience on the iPhone platform, we will endeavor to do so." Still, it's a fair guess that a future version could notify you when someone is calling.In the future, we're looking forward to what Skype might do with video calls now that the iPhone 3GS has its shiny new video recorder.

A "serious memory corruption bug" in the iPhone can make it vulnerable to being taken over by a single specially-crafted text message, security researchers showed today. So if you get a text message that consists of a square on your iPhone - perhaps you should worry. Or, much more likely, it's a prank from a friend trying to freak you out. The Black Hat conference in Las Vegas saw a demonstration by Collin Mulliner and Charlie Miller, who are independent security experts, who proved the weakness by taking control of an iPhone belonging to CNet's Elinor Mills. Mills described it thus: While I was talking on the phone to Charlie Miller, his partner, Collin Mulliner, sent me a text message from his phone. One minute I'm talking to Miller and the next minute my phone is dead, and this time it's not AT&T's fault. After a few seconds it came back to life, but I was not able to make or receive calls until I rebooted. The researchers told Mills that "an attacker could exploit the hole to make calls, steal data, send text messages, and do basically anything that I can do with my iPhone". How many iPhones are vulnerable? All of them. How many will be affected? Ah, that's a lot harder. Not the majority. Not even a large minority. It depends on whether Apple can fix the problem before the malicious hackers out there figure out how the hack is done.

Apple on Wednesday apologized for technology issues that crippled the iPhone 4 pre-order process, but said that the company processed orders for 600,000 of the devices in one day.As a result, new orders will not ship until at least July 14, according to the Apple Web site."It was the largest number of pre-orders Apple has ever taken in a single day and was far higher than we anticipated, resulting in many order and approval system malfunctions," Apple said. "Many customers were turned away or abandoned the process in frustration. We apologize to everyone who encountered difficulties, and hope that they will try again or visit an Apple or carrier store once the iPhone 4 is in stock."The new iPhone 4 is not scheduled to hit stores until June 24, but Apple, AT&T and several other retail outlets started taking pre-orders for the device on June 15. Unfortunately, the companies' systems could not handle the extra demand, and many online buyers were met with timed-out browsers and 404 errors.Apple subsequently updated its Web site to say that pre-orders going forward will not ship until July 2. The company's pre-order site now says they will ship by July 14.Earlier today, AT&T said its pre-order sales were 10 times higher than pre-orders for the iPhone 3GS last year. Faced with this "unprecedented demand," AT&T suspended the pre-order process on Wednesday "in order to fulfill the orders we've already received."Apple's inventory will determine when AT&T resumes pre-orders, the company said.There were also reports that people trying to purchase the iPhone 4 accidentally saw the personal information of other iPhone customers. AT&T said it has "been unable to replicate the issue, but the information displayed did not include call-detail records, social security numbers, or credit card information.""In the meantime, we are looking into this matter," the company concluded.Radio Shack, which was accepting in-person pre-orders at its stores, also ended the program amidst demand. Wednesday afternoon, Best Buy said it too had suspended iPhone 4 pre-orders. Wal-Mart is expected to start selling the iPhone 4 in select stores starting June 24.Editor's Note: This story was updated at 4pm Eastern time with information from Best Buy.

Dozens of law-enforcement agencies across the U.S. are preparing to use a new, mobile facial-recognition tool to identify individuals. There's also an Android version in the works.Some law-enforcement agencies are preparing to deploy a mobile facial-recognition tool, The Wall Street Journal reported today.According to the Journal, about 40 law-enforcement agencies across the U.S. will be making the handheld product available to their officers in the field as early as September. The device, which has been developed by Massachusetts-based BI2 Technologies, allows officers to take a photo of a person from a distance of five feet or less. That photo is then compared with a database of images of people with criminal records to see if there is a match. The device is also capable of scanning a person's iris.Like with any other platform, there are some limitations with BI2's device. For one, it needs to be attached to the back of an iPhone in order to work, which leaves out agencies using Android, Windows Phone, or any other devices. According to the Journal, BI2 will offer an Android-capable version "in the future" but didn't say when.In addition, BI2's database isn't necessarily exhaustive. The Journal said that it includes photos of correctional facility inmates but that only a few states are allowing the company to access mug shots. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal logs, as well as photos on driver's licenses, are not included in the database.Facial recognition has always been a hot-button issue for privacy advocates, and BI2's technology likely will face the same concerns. Realizing that, Sheriff Paul Babeu of Arizona's Pinal County told the Journal that his officers will only use the tool when a person of interest isn't carrying any form of identification. What's more, he said, his officers will not use it without cause.Facial recognition came back into the forefront of the privacy debate last month when the European Union decided to examine Facebook's facial-recognition feature to whether it violates any privacy regulations.That decision followed a claim by CNN that Google was working on a facial-recognition application. Immediately, Google fired back, saying that it wasn't doing anything of the sort.At the D9 Conference in May, Google's former CEO and current executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, acknowledged that Google had come close to offering facial recognition in its Google Goggles image-recognition service, but Schmidt stopped it before it could launch. He said he was concerned that facial recognition can be used for both good and bad.Even so, the company has been involved with facial recognition in the past, offering the technology in its Picasa photo-management service.For law-enforcement agencies, there are also legal implications of facial recognition. As the Journal points out, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that agencies must have "reasonable suspicion" in order to fingerprint an individual. Whether agencies need to have the same "suspicion" to use BI2's tool remains to be seen.Regardless, it seems that at least some law-enforcement agencies believe the technology will be extremely beneficial. In an Arizona Republic article posted on BI2's site, Babeu said that the technology has been valuable on multiple levels for law-enforcement agencies."From an officer-safety perspective, to find out who we are dealing with, this literally leapfrogged us ahead in the ability of law enforcement to best protect our community," Babeu said.

The clone manufacturer who released an iPhone 5 knock-off last week now says that they will sue Apple if they release the real iPhone 5 in China. Surreal? Hilarious? Pathetic? All of the above.Hong Kong-based GooPhone, who designed their cheapo Android phone after the alleged Apple iPhone 5 parts leaked during the last few months, has a very rational argument: they have released their clone first, so everything that comes after that must be a copy, even if they actually made their phone after the parts of a phone that hasn't been released yet but that everyone believes is the real thing.In other words: since their clone was released first, that makes it the original phone. The iPhone 5 is the actual clone, not theirs.Makes sense? Of course it doesn't. Who cares! It's fun!I just hope Samsung is taking notes and hurries up to release an iPhone 5 clone as soon as possible. Come on, Samsung—you got one week! You can totally do this.

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- European telcos are likely to subsidize Apple's new version of the iPhone, say analysts.Exclusive Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) partner O2 is expected to sell the hotly-anticipated 3G iPhone for about $196 or £100, according to a report by the U.K's Times Online, citing a UBS analyst report. The speculation follows a story first reported by Fortune.com that AT&T (T, Fortune 500) was planning to sell the new iPhone this summer for around $200.Apple CEO Steve Jobs is widely expected to unveil the faster, sleeker version of the iPhone during the company's developer conference in one week. The new iPhone would be available later this month in the U.S. through Apple and AT&T. AT&T pricing strategy calls for a $200 subsidy for customers who sign two-year service contracts."It will be subsidized," says CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood, of O2's iPhone price plan. "But it won't be free," Wood speculates. O2 customers "will have to take connections or contracts at the point of purchase. They will have to sign on the dotted line. That's how they will make sure they get their money back," says Wood.The lower-priced phones in the U.S. and potentially the U.K. and other parts of Europe would help juice the iPhone's sales volume and give the telcos an attractive weapon to win new subscribers.In the United States, AT&T says it pulls in an average of $95 a month from each iPhone customer, nearly twice the average monthly bill of its conventional cell phone user. AT&T has a revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires it to give Apple as much as 25% of its iPhone customers' monthly payments.Subsidies are a widespread pricing practice in the United States and overseas. In exchange for a cheaper phone, customers are locked in to a carrier for a year or two. It's a small investment by the telcos for a large return, as Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi outlined in a report last month.Cutting the price of the iPhone in half would put the cost of the phone within reach of more consumers and likely double the number of iPhones sold, Sacconaghi argues. After giving Apple its cut of the revenue, the remaining take for AT&T is between $70 and $75 a month per iPhone user, totaling more than $1,700 over the life of the two-year contract, wrote Sacconaghi.Though it didn't get much attention at the time, on anApril 23 conference call with analysts, Apple CFO Tim Cook said the company didn't put price guidelines on European carriers selling the original iPhone."The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that, I wouldn't comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential," Cook said at the time.One thing is clear, the iPhone's manufacturer's suggested retail price of $400 seems more fluid than ever."There's certainly more flexibility in pricing," says CCS Insight's Wood.

The video below is very boring, but you should watch it anyway. Its subject is a totally unspectacular mid-grade projection on a dark wall with big implications for the near-term future of human communication and entertainment. The hook is that this image is generated by a Toshiba Pico Prototype the size of a large cell-phone (at right). Capable of spitting out a 60” wide image at 10 lumens, the micro-projector is due to hit store shelves sometime early next year and will also be licensed to a wide variety of other companies.Take a look for yourself:As such projectors shrink in size, increase their resolution and require less and less power, it’s clear that they’ll be incorporated into mobile and other devices. I’d be completely shocked if Steve Jobs, the folks at Apple and all their competitors aren’t right now scrambling to develop the appropriate apps and incorporate the Pico technology into their next-gen products.

This is complete speculation based on the facts we know. Apple gets a share of the profit from AT&T iPhone subscribers. Gene Munster in 2007 suggested that Apple is getting $18/mo per iPhone subscriber from AT&T. BUT, what if that number is based on net profit?Yesterday (Aug 1) the Washington Post published an article to which AT&T replied that:BUT.. What if Apple was being paid profit based on usage? So, instead of the $18/mo that was suggested in 2007, what if it was really a percentage? Apps like Skype, Fring, Slingbox, Google Voice, etc. that would cause AT&T to spend more money relative to some baseline usage scenario, would in effect cost Apple money.Imagine it this way. If you're a normal iPhone user who's paying around $90/mo for service, and you use your phone what AT&T and Apple consider an "Average" amount, Apple is paid 20%, or $18. But, there is an increased cost to AT&T if you use your phone substantially more than Average. Let's say, the cost to provide service to an Average customer is $54, which means the net profit is $36. Apple and AT&T split that amount. (These numbers are made up to show my idea.. just bear with me). But, for a high-usage account, the cost to provide service might be closer to $75. That means there's only $15 net profit for AT&T and Apple to share. Apple suddenly loses $10.50 per subscriber, per month that uses at the higher level. (Again, 50% of $15 = $7.50. $18-$7.50 = $10.50)If AT&T is correct, and they really didn't have anything to do with the App removal, and Apple IS to blame, this scenario fits. It explains why Apple restricts high bandwidth apps. They want to keep the cost of the service low to maximize their profit.Again, this is speculation.. But, it's not something I've seen ANYONE else suggest. Am I totally out-to-lunch? Did I just hit the nail on the head? Let me know!

Apple has quietly enabled a mobile ads tracking system in iOS 6, with unique per-device identifiers that provide advertisers with more user information than ever before. Having blocked developers from using UDID codes – device-specific codes that could be monitored to see if adverts led to app downloads – Apple replaced the unofficial functionality with an official version, IFA/IFDA (Identifier For Advertising) that comes automatically set active, Business Insider reports.Unlike UDID numbers, which are assigned to the device and cannot be changed, IFA codes are designed to be ephemeral. Created randomly and then anonymously assigned to a phone or tablet, they transiently link publishers serving up adverts and the ad servers so that an appropriate advert is displayed on subsequent browsing.If you go on to download an app, the ad server can see what led you to that download, something which was impossible to track previously. There’s no personally-identifiable data, but the fact that Apple has it turned on by default might frustrate or upset some privacy advocates.IFA can be switched off on iOS 6 devices, though the setting to do so isn’t where you’d perhaps first expect. Rather than being part of the Privacy options, it’s under General > About > Advertising, and labeled “Limit Ad Tracking”; for IFA to be deactivated, the switch must – arguably counter-intuitively – be set to “on” rather than “off.”“The biggest thing we’re excited about is that it’s on by default, so we expect most people will leave it on” ad provider Mobile Theory’s CEO Scott Swanson told BI, saying that while the data was personally non-identifiable, it nonetheless provided “a really meaningful inference of behavior” previously unavailable to advertisers.

According to research carried out by app store analytics company Distimo, the majority of sales taking place in the App Store are for games, while Android users are buying more tools and applications.Studying the top 15 paid applications  for the iPhone, the report found nine of them were games, while not even one game made the top 15 on the Android chart. To balance that, not one productivity or utilities app appeared in Apple’s top 15.This pattern continues for free games as well. One important point from the report is Classic games on Android Market are more popular than in the Apple App Store, with even 3 out of the 15 most popular games for Android being emulators. These types of emulators are not allowed in the Apple App Store.If you are a developer you can sign up for developing apps for iphoneand android.

Last month, after reading about it on TechCrunch, I downloaded and tried Earthscape, a program for the iPhone that mimicked much of what the wonderful Google Earth does on traditional computer. Unfortunately, I found it to be a disappointment – it was slow and hard to use. It left me pining for a real Google Earth on the iPhone, and I deleted it.Sunday, my desire for the real thing was fulfilled. Google Earth was released for the iPhone, and it’s a spectacular app that you’ll want immediately.As with the desktop version, you begin with the Earth floating in space. Tapping on the image zooms in, and you can use the pinching gesture to more precisely zoom in and out.Continue to tap, and you’ll eventually be down to street level.Google Earth uses the accelerometer in the iPhone to let you move around on the map, or angle it for a horizon view.As with Google Maps on the iPhone, it works with the device’s GPS. Tapping the locator icon in the lower left-hand corner of the screen takes you to your current location, indicated by the familiar blue dot.Google Earth for the desktop features multiple layers, so you can overlay information on top of the maps. For now, there are only two layers in the iPhone version. You an get Wikipedia information for a specific location if the appropriate article has been geo-tagged. There don’t seem to be too many of these, but perhaps the release of this software will encourage authors to geotag more Wikipedia entries.And see the little blue squares in the screen shots above? Those are where photos have been tagged with location data in Panaramio, a site designed to link images with spots on the globe. Tapping on one of the squares brings up an image at that location.Google Earth for iPhone duplicates some of the features in the Google Maps application, such as being able to search for local businesses. The two are semi-linked – you can tap on a location in Google Earth and go to the same spot in Google Maps, but not vice versa. To get back to Google Earth, it must re-launch, a downside of Apple not allowing apps to run in the background on the iPhone.There are a few annoyances. The accelerometer is sensitive, and easy for the screen to "drift" away from the view you want. Fortunately, you can turn off this feature. Also, Google Earth starts with the globe view every time it starts, then slowly zooms back down to the vicinity of your last location. This gets old quickly.Finally, because it uses your phone’s GPS, your battery level takes a beating – particularly since this app is so much fun, you’ll spend a lot of time working with it.If you’re an iPhone or iPod Touch user, you’ll want to get this application ASAP. It’s free, as you’d expect.Read more at the Google Earth blog. I also like Harry McCracken’s review at Technologizer.

George Hotz (aka Geohot), the developer who had released popular jailbreaking and unlocking tools like blackra1n, blacksn0w has published a new blog post to report that he has jailbroken iPhone 4.In April, there were speculations that Geohot will release an untethered jailbreak for iPhone OS 3.1.3 and iOS 4 called limera1n as he had bought a domain. Geohot had taken part in Nuit Du Hack conference held in Paris at the end of June, where he mentioned that he had found a new bootrom exploit, which can ultimately pwn all iPhones for life, including iPhone 4. He has named this exploit as pwned4life.Geohot talks about jailbreaking iPhone 4, limera1n and pwned4life in his blog post:Got one of these in the mail today and figured I’d give it a shot. As far as a release goes, it probably won’t happen from me. limera1n is little more than a raindrop on a website; it was never mentioned by me previous to this post. pwned4life is a complete invention of some blogger in a basement somewhere. When I said pwned for life, I was referring to the original iPhone, 3G, and Touch; which of course are, by the aptly named PwnageTool. Again, please don’t ask for release dates. Every person that does makes me want to release a little bit less.Another Developer, Comex had also announced  a Userland jailbreak which is ready for the iPhone 4 ( expected after iOS 4.01 / 4.1 release).Stay tuned for more jailbreak and unlocking info by following us on Twitter and/or subscribing to our RSS feeds.

A day after President Barack Obama won a second term, stocks suffered their worst beating in nearly a year. Late selling caused to the $INDU ) to finish down more than 300 points, its largest loss since Nov. 9, 2011. The blue-chip index ended the day below 13,000 for the first time since Aug. 2, and the major U.S. averages were all down at least 2.4%. Bank stocks were the weakest sector in part because it's likely the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill will remain largely intact. In addition, Elizabeth Warren, a critic of many U.S. banking practices, won a seat in the U.S. Senate. JPM ), a critic of bank regulation, was down $2.32 to $40.56. Health insurance stocks were lower because the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Reform Act -- aka Obamacare -- is likely to stay in place.Meanwhile, oil prices fell back sharply in part because of worries about global demand. Europe became a worry after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said he expected no change to the weak eurozone economy in the near future. Worse, he said, the weakness has begun to affect Germany. European stocks immediately sold off -- and sharply, too. The dollar rose against the euro and British pound.

After all the hubbub and controversy caused by the release of SingPlayer for iPhone back in May, we knew it would take a serious change of heart for AT&T to reverse course on the issue of 3G streaming . The app's super-conspicuous lack of 3G was one of the clearest statements around that the iPhone represented a level of data consumption that AT&T was fairly unprepared for, and that certain uses like VoIP over 3G and live video streams were just not going to fly. Well, we've just now gotten over that VoIP hump , and now AT&T has given in to SlingPlayer demand at last. AT&T says it has been testing an "optimized" version of the app on its 3G network since December, and Sling says the dynamic bandwidth adjustment should keep the app from bringing the network to grinding halt -- in not so many words. The 3G-friendly version will be a free upgrade to the $30 application, and should be available as soon as the revised software makes its way through the App Store approval process.

Digg's Kevin Rose has a solid (but far from perfect ) track record when it comes to Apple rumors, and he just drove the nerds of SXSWi crazy with his latest gaze into the crystal ball: he says the iPhone 3.0 will have copy and paste. Kev says that the interface is much like the magnifying glass -- you use two fingers to select the text you want, and then you can cut or copy. Sure, that's great, but we think the bigger news is that Rose says 3.0 won't have support for background apps -- which makes his claim that that 3.0 will bring the iPhone "up to speed with the Palm Pre" a little suspect. We'll find out what's what in just a few days , but in the meantime check the video of Rose after the break.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureiPhone users expecting their Passcode Lock to prevent thieves running up their bill will be disappointed, as it emerges that the "Emergency Call" button actually allows any number to be dialled.While most users are happy to keylock their iPhone with the sliding finger, some opt to configure a passcode to lock the device more effectively - suffering the inconvenience of entering their PIN every time they use the phone. But while that process will protect data on the device (unlike last time) it won't stop a pickpocket running up your phone bill by making calls to any number.But it neglects to define what numbers constitute an emergency, and it turns out that, in the UK at least, the user is permitted to call anyone they wish.This could be described as a feature - one man's emergency is another's routine call - but we can't help wondering if the typical user is really aware of this particular feature, or if the manual could have been a bit more explicit in stating that someone experiencing an emergency is free to call on support from anywhere. ®

The iPhone 4 's massive launch hasn't been blemish free, with reports of spotty displays (which seem to have disappeared) and antenna woes being rather widely reported. Well -- it looks like it's possible there's another issue too -- this time with the proximity sensor. Now, we're no strangers to spontaneously turning on speakerphone with our faces (though admittedly our cheeks are pretty round), so it's hard to say if this is an iPhone 4-specific issue, but the mounting reports would suggest that it's possible the new handsets sensor is a little bit... over sensitive. Reported issues include accidentally disconnecting calls, throwing the speakerphone switch, and putting people on hold accidentally. What about you? Are you having problems with your iPhone 4's proximity sensor? Let us know in the comments.

AT&T is circulating a survey among some of its longer-term iPhone users with a checklist of features they'd like to see. It's a follow-up to a similar survey a few months back, and apparently also serves to judge reactions to the 2.1 firmware. Some of the most regular complaints make the list, including picture messaging through MMS, landscape mode for email, a user-replaceable battery, and the all-mighty cut and paste. The survey probably doesn't imply any kind of imminent changes, but it's nice to hear that AT&T is trying to listen to what we've all been screaming for so long. [ AppleInsider

When Steve Jobs first dreamed up the iPhone with his team at Apple, he didn't want it to run on AT&T's network. He wanted to create his own network.So says Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Stanton, who spent a good deal of time with the late Apple CEO during the phone's development period. Jobs wanted to replace carriers completely, Stanton says, instead using the unlicensed spectrum that WiFi operates on for his phone."He and I spent a lot of time talking about whether synthetically you could create a carrier using WiFi spectrum," Stanton said on Monday at the Law Seminar International Event in Seattle. "That was part of his vision."Both WiFi and cellular frequencies belong on the ultra-high-frequency level of the radio frequency spectrum. WiFi takes up five channels of the 2.4 GHz band. Other frequency bands are allotted to various purposes and cellular providers by the FCC.Jobs gave up his plans to create his own network in 2007, ultimately settling on a deal with AT&T.When Jobs debuted the iPhone, it marked a huge change in the way phone makers and carriers developed a device. Jobs sold AT&T Apple's iPhone sight unseen. Previously, carriers were an integral part of device development, adding tweaks, features and software throughout the process. Not so with the iPhone. Apple orchestrated the entire phone experience, while AT&T was simply afforded the opportunity to sell it. Android and other major mobile phone platforms followed this model with their smartphones later on, though to a lesser degree.It's not outrageous to think Jobs and Stanton spoke candidly about network matters, given Stanton's long history with wireless carriers. He was the first employee at McCaw Cellular, the national wireless provider that later became AT&T Wireless. He started another firm called Western Wireless, which birthed an operator called Voicestream that was bought out by Deutsche Telekom and became T-Mobile.I'd be interested to find out what sort of challenges Apple encountered trying to develop and get a phone to work properly just on the WiFi spectrum. The company certainly could have just bought out an existing carrier with its billions in the bank. Either option must have been too costly or provided too little pay-off to make it worthwhile.

Xbox SmartGlass for Android and iPhone will be coming in early 2013, Microsoft has told us, following a demo of the innovative service on Windows 8. SmartGlass was first demonstrated back at E3 in June 2012.Xbox SmartGlass will give you expanded control and integration with your Xbox 360 from your smart device. It's going to be available across Microsoft's platforms (Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT) from launch, before landing on other platforms in early 2013.UPDATE: It looks like the Android app has already arrived, you can read about it here.SmartGlass will give you the ability to use your phone as a controller as long as you are on the same network as your console, a function already available through the My Xbox Live companion app on iPhone (pictured above).Although Microsoft is yet to show SmartGlass on all these platforms, we do have some screens from Xbox SmartGlass for Android, iPhone and iPad in the gallery below. We've included a screen from the Android and iPhone apps just below, so you know what to expect.SmartGlass will allow control over movies and music, moving playback from one device to another, so you can pause on your tablet and resume on your Xbox, back on the big screen. It will also allow your mobile device to act as a second screen for things like movies and music, providing information on actors or artists.This second-screen experience extends to supported games: for example, it will provide a GPS map for Forza Horizon or let you line up the next track for Dance Central 3, we have been told.It will act as a remote for the new Xbox Internet Explorer browser, so you can zoom using pinch on your display.Xbox SmartGlass will be available in Windows 8, which launches on 26 October and Windows Phone 8, launching 29 October, initially. You will need an Xbox Live Gold subscription for some SmartGlass features to work and we're not certain exactly which features Android and iOS users will get.Once we've got firm dates for SmartGlass on other platforms, we'll bring you all the details.

Nielsen's just released a study confirming what some other studies have already concluded -- that Android devices account for the single largest swath of smartphone users in the US, with 39 percent OS share as of the second quarter. That compares with 28 percent for iOS, although Apple still reigns as the country's top-selling device maker. Simply put, that's a reflection of the fact that Apple is the only outfit churning out iOS devices, whereas a bevy of companies led by HTC, Motorola, and Samsung have helped make Android the dominant OS in the states. And let's not forget about RIM, another hardware / software shop, which still commands a 20 percent chunk of the market. Rounding out the list, Windows Phone and Windows Mobile account for nine percent, largely thanks to sales of HTC handsets, while webOS and Symbian each eked out two percent. At this point we don't doubt that Android is the most ubiquitous mobile operating system this side of the Atlantic, although it's worth noting that Nielsen based its results on a sample of roughly 20,000 people -- all of whom are postpaid subscribers.

The Quip app promised to let people send pictures to each other for free — like sending a multimedia message but without any fees.What it didn't say was that anyone with a few web skills could see them as well.Quip stored the private images on a publicly accessible web server without any encryption, making them easy prey for savvy internet users.Now some of the most intimate moments of thousands of people are being circulated on web forums.Many photos show people posing nude or having sex. Others show a day at the baseball or baby shots.One image shows a man naked from the waist up and seemingly covered in cuts and blood. Another seems to have been taken inside the White House.Some internet users have also allegedly matched up nude photos with real names and Facebook profiles.On one web forum, a user identifying as one of the makers of the Quip app said the system had been shut down."Hello, this is Ish, the founder of Addy Mobile, makers of the Quip app," said "ish_addy" on Reddit."As soon as this post came to our attention, we immediately shut down our servers. We have also now disabled all S3 access and have started to systematically secure all files in the system."We will not bring the system back up until we have adequate security around all files shared over Quip."However many of the photos, saved by people before the servers were shut down, are still being circulated.

News of a successful attack that almost instantly gives full access to an iPhone's password keychain made its way around the Web on Thursday after Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology revealed the exploit to IDG News Service. While the fact that hackers could access a device's keychain in such a short time certainly sounds alarming, the attack isn't entirely new, and is actually a product of Apple's "DRM approach" to security, one iOS security expert told Ars.Fraunhofer SIT's exploit first relies on physical access to an iPhone, so an attacker has to get your iPhone away from you before digging in. In most cases like this, you would likely want to use Apple's (now free) remote wipe feature in order to protect your data, but remote wipe is easily thwarted by removing the device's SIM card. Any attacker sophisticated enough to decrypt the keychain will know this trick.Once an attacker has your phone, he could use any of the commonly available jailbreaks to install an SSH server, install a keychain hacking script, and collect the decrypted password information.Part of what makes the attack relatively trivial is that the cryptographic key used for the keychain is stored on the iPhone. Once a device is jailbroken, hackers can use iOS's built-in APIs to access and decrypt certain passwords—including those for network access and e-mail accounts—stored in the keychain. From there, passwords from VPN access or e-mail accounts can be further used to gain more passwords, or e-mail accounts can be used to request password resets for a number of online services.But while Fraunhofer SIT's particular methods may be new, accessing the keychain and other encrypted information on a jailbroken iPhone has been possible for some time. iPhone forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski told Ars that similar exploits have been around since about the time of the introduction of the iPhone 3G."Several dev teams have been able to easily deduce Apple's encryption keys for the keychain; it just hasn't been widely advertised," Zdziarski said. The "new" part of Fraunhofer SIT's attack, however, leverages Apple's APIs to access the keychain instead of other methods.The real problem, according to Zdziarski, is that Apple hasn't yet fully implemented a truly secure environment for iOS. "Apple has—since introducing encryption—been relying on their DRM know-how, and just erasing the label that says 'DRM' and calling it 'security,'" he explained. "The problem with this is that DRM only makes things a little more difficult for hackers.""Real security relies on the strength of the key, and the secrecy of the key," Zdziarski continued. "And as long as the keys are all stored on the iPhone and don't rely on a user password, they can easily be compromised."In other words, even while Apple has continually improved the security of information on iPhones and other iDevices, the same types of flaws that enable moderately skilled hackers to access an entire unencrypted disk image of an iPhone still exist. And while Apple offers APIs for developers to add an additional layer of encryption for user data, it's up to developers to implement it independently.Zdziarski said that he believes Apple is pushing to make the iPhone compliant with security standards set forth in Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). When that happens, government and enterprise users can be less wary about iPhone security issues. "But at the end of the day," he said, "Apple will need to abandon their DRM approach if they want true security, as opposed to just some fancy marketing strategies."

Sizes go up, prices fall. These are the two hallmark rules of the TV land. Just a few years ago, $800 couldn’t buy you a screen much larger ... Read moreMost folks have accepted that they'll buy new cases almost every time they upgrade their iPhones, thanks to subtle — and occasionally rather bold — design changes. But repurchasing all their accessories, including charger cables and speaker docks? That is a tougher, pricier pill to swallow.According to TechCrunch's John Biggs, we should get our credit cards ready as that shopping spree is inevitable. At the very least you'll be looking at buying an extra cable or two (currently priced at $19) and, unless there are some third-party adapters out there to ease the pain, you may also have to kiss your current speaker dock goodbye.Biggs writes that "three independent manufacturers" told him that the next-generation iPhone will use a 19-pin port, rather than the wider 30-pin port found on current iPhones, iPads and iPods. If true, this news will make life a bit difficult for third-party accessory manufacturers, who have accepted Apple's 30-pin port design as a standard "since Apple released the third-generation iPod" in 2003, writes Biggs.As skeptical as I normally am regarding reports like this one, it's actually not all that unlikely that Apple would redesign the iPhone — and subsequently iPod and iPad — ports. The 19-pin design would save valuable space, after all, and interface technology has made major advancements in 10 years.Let's not forget, the Cupertino-based company recently redesigned the MagSafe, its proprietary magnetically-attached power connector, too, and that was only around since 2006.Want more tech news, silly puns, or amusing links? You'll get plenty of all three if you keep up with Rosa Golijan, the writer of this post, by following her on Twitter, subscribing to her Facebook posts, or circling her on Google+.

The iPhone has been hacked in the past to use modified external keyboards, but new mods promise much more general interaction. Now, iPhone expert Ralf Ackermann has succeeded in supporting a standard Bluetooth keyboard using an external Bluetooth approach and is working on supporting an internal one.For the external approach, Ackermann modified a Robotech Bluetooth module, which he placed in an iPhone battery sleeve and connected to the iPhone (serial) connector port at the bottom of the unit. This allowed the the phone to communicate directly with the the module using the Bluetooth serial port profile.The whole thing works courtesy of Jay "saurik" Freeman's Veency application. Ackermann used a tiny libvncclient to generate keyboard events, which were then passed to Veency. Veency then provided the keyboard event injection using the iPhone's private Graphics Services framework.You can find out more about this external module project over at Ackermann's blog. He'll be posting schematics and code as he gets his site set up.Ars readers may be more excited, though, by his work on a completely internal solution. Here, Ackermann discovered BlueSn0w, part of the iBluetooth project. BlueSn0w (yes, its name is apparently inspired by the iPhone dev team's yellowsn0w) will scan for discoverable Bluetooth devices. According to this Flickr page, the module seems to enable the Bluetooth UART interface to communicateThe internal solution depends on gaining access to the Bluetooth module stack. "User space BT stacks are not common—nevertheless, of course they can be done," Ackermann told Ars. "In the past, I had a look at an adaptation of the Linux Bluez stack for ATMEL uCs for instance—and this seems similar." Once the stack becomes available, Ackermann believes a fully internal solution will be quickly usable. There is no time estimate on this due to the complete volunteer nature of the BlueSn0w project but it looks like hobbyists are drawing close to the goal.Allowing the iPhone to accept keyboard input from an external Bluetooth keyboard will move the iPhone forward in opening new opportunities for general computing and on-the-go note taking. Taking into account the iPhone's newly realized video out support, the entire platform looks like it's at the brink of a transformative revolution.

As more and more businesses are switching to Apple products, Jobs is trying to make the move on two of the biggest U.S banks to become iPhone supporters. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are considering whether to let employees use the Apple iPhone as an alternative to RIM’s Blackberry for corporate e-mail. The banks are currently testing software for the iPhone that is designed to make it secure enough for company messages. The tests are the latest sign that RIM may be losing its tight grip on the corporate smartphone market. Companies are experimenting with alternatives such as Apple’s iPhone or devices that use Google’s Android software. “People are delighted with their iPhones and Android phones and they want to use them for work,” said Roger Entner, head of telecom research at Nielsen Co. “The result is RIM now has real competition for corporate customers.”RIM is already losing out on the battle, losing 15 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading this year before today, while Apple had climbed 51 percent. Apple led by Jobs, reported last month that 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone, including Procter & Gamble Co., General Electric Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. is exploring whether to let works use Androids or iPhones for corporate e-mail.Currently Bank of America, which has about 284,000 employees and Citigroup, which has about 258,000 employees are deploying or testing the new smartphones out. The efforts are intended to widen the choice of devices employees can use, rather than replace the Blackberry. The trials at the two companies involve more than 1,000 employees, which typically takes four to six weeks, and will be followed by a pilot project before potentially wider implementation. Laura Hunter, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina- based Bank of America, declined to comment on any specific trials, adding that “we continuously evaluate new and innovative technologies.”Apple is taking steps to make its products more appealing to businesses and challenge the Blackberry, which won over Wall Street banks and corporations with is security and reliability. Apple is working to improve the iPhone’s security by strengthening encryption tools and adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with server computers that can wipeout or lock an iPhone if it’s lost. The company even enlisted computer-services provide Unisys Corp. to help it sell more devices to corporate customers. While both RIM and Apple’s share of the global mobile-phone market rose last quarter from a year earlier as more consumers upgraded to smartphones, Apple moved into fourth position, knocking RIM into fifth, according to research firm IDC. The popularity of Apple’s latest model, the iPhone 4, helped the company sell more handsets than its Canadian rival.What do you think of the iPhone moving to Corporate America?

AT&T is raising the fees it charges buyers of the iPhone and other smartphones if they break their two-year contracts, while lowering them for "dumb" phones to better align the fees with their real costs.Starting June 1, smartphone buyers will have to pay $325 for breaking their contract, up from $175 currently. For buyers of regular phones, the fee is being decreased by $25 to $150.The early termination fee goes down for every month customers stay in their contract — by $10 for smart phones and $4 for regular phones. So if a smart phone contract is broken after two months, the termination fee is reduced by $20 to $305.The changes only apply to new contracts and renewals.AT&T charges customers $199 for the latest model of the iPhone, but pays Apple far more than that. AT&T makes the subsidy back through the customer's service fees over the two-year contract period. AT&T likely loses money for every customer that breaks a contract and pays a $175 termination fee, but may break even with the new, higher fee. A new iPhone model is expected to be announced next month.Meanwhile, simpler phones may cost AT&T only $125 to buy, meaning that a $175 termination fee is excessive.Following the same logic, Verizon Wireless doubled its smartphone termination fees in November, from $175 to $350. Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile still charge the same termination fees for all types of phones: $200. All three also pro-rate the fees for customers who leave later in their contracts.The Federal Communications Commission has questioned Verizon Wireless about the higher termination fees for smartphone users, but hasn't taken any action.The pro-rating of the fees came about after the carriers settled several class-action lawsuits by customers who found it unfair that they paid the full termination fee when breaking a contract after nearly two years.

Thomas Suarez is in the 6th grade at a middle school in the South Bay. And while most of his peers are probably fussing over new soccer kleets or watching the Disney channel, he’s creating iOS apps and giving TED Talks.Suarez, who’s not even old enough to have a Facebook account, has been fascinated by computers and technology since before kindergarten. He’s established his own company, CarrotCorp and has made two iOS apps that are currently in the App Store: Earth Fortune, which displays different colors of Earth depending on what your fortune is and his most successful- Bustin Jieber, a Whac-a-Mole for Justin Bieber.“A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them,” he says. “And it’s difficult because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program…And not many parents have written apps.” Suarez, inspired by Steve Jobs, started an App Club at school where any student can come to learn to design an app. In the future, Suarez wants to create more apps, more games and get into Android programming and development. He plans on continuing his app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.Knowing that human beings such as Suarez exist makes me really hopeful and excited for the future. Watch his TED Talk from the recent TEDx conference in Manhattan Beach below. There are more great finds from around the Internet every day at TNW Shareables.

Motorola and Verizon invited comparisons, and that's what they gotThe Droid lands in stores Friday, and on Thursday the heavyweight reviewers -- which is to say the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg and the New York Times' David Pogue -- weighed in.Given that Motorola (MOT) and Verizon (VZ) pitched the Droid in its first TV ad as everything Apple's (AAPL) and AT&T's (T) iPhone was not, it was perhaps inevitable that every reviewer so far, including these two, treated its arrival as a grudge match.Mossberg's review is positive but tepid -- especially the video version. He plods through the comparisons item by item like a slightly boring homework assignment. His top-line summary:"While it has some significant drawbacks, I regard it as a success overall. It's the best super-smart phone Verizon offers, the best Motorola phone I've tested and the best hardware so far to run [Google's (GOOG)] Android. I can recommend the Droid to Verizon loyalists who have lusted for a better smart phone, but don't want to switch networks." (link)Pogue being Pogue has more fun with the assignment, even running a Twitter contest to come up with a new term for these newfangled gizmos. (He's going with "app phones"; Mossberg calls them "super-smart phones.") Pogue's bottom line:Since Verizon seems to want a Droid-iPhone faceoff, here it is: the Droid wins on phone network, customizability, GPS navigation, speaker, physical keyboard, removable battery and openness (free operating system, mostly uncensored app store). The iPhone wins on simplicity, refinement, thinness, design, Web browsing, music/video synching with your computer, accessory ecosystem and quality/quantity of the app store." (link)For a more thorough comparison, written by someone who actually seems to care, check out developer Greg Kumparak's 2,500 word review in TechCrunch. His conclusion: "At this point, I honestly feel that either choice would make any sane person incredibly happy."

In late March, four US Senators banded together and wrote a letter to Apple asking that they remove apps that alert users as to the whereabouts of DUI checkpoints.“With more than 10,000 Americans dying in drunk-driving crashes every year,” the letter stated, “providing access to iPhone and iPad applications that alert users to DUI checkpoints is harmful to public safety. We know that your company shares our desire to end the scourge of drunk driving and we therefore would ask you to remove these applications from your store.”While some of these apps make use of information housed in publicly accessible databases, many of them rely on crowdsourcing. Indeed, one app singled out by the letter is alleged to have had approximately 10 million users actively alerting “each other to DUI checkpoints in real time.”In a separate letter sent concurrently by US Sentator Charles Schumer, Schumer also called out apps like Trapster and PhantomAlert which work to alert users as to the whereabouts of police speed traps and red light cameras.Well, Apple took those letters to heart, partially.In revised app store guidelines discovered by Mac Rumors, Apple has updated Section 22.8 to now read:So one out of two ain’t bad, and in all honesty, Apple made the right decision here.DUI checkpoint apps do nothing more than tell potentially intoxicated drivers where not to go. They’re still driving drunk, just on the down low. Apps like Trapster, however, might effectively work to cut down on speeding when a police speed trap is noted. Though to be fair, it might encourage speeders to pick their spots more strategically.Either way, drunk driving is a lot more serious and contentious than speeders which is probably why Apple chose to only address DUI checkpoint apps.We should note, however, that DUI checkpoint apps already on the iTunes App Store haven’t been kicked out and we’ll have to wait and see if they’re grandfathered in or if they’ll eventually be removed. Take DUI Dodger, for example, which enables users to view and submit checkpoints in their area.

Developing applications for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is big business, and it's one that Novell (NASDAQ: NOVL) wants a piece of. Novell today released new software called MonoTouch that aims to bring .NET applications to the iPhone.MonoTouch is based on Novell's Mono project, which is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework. Unlike Mono, MonoTouch is neither free nor open source and is being sold as a commercial product by Novell. With MonoTouch, Novell is expanding the developer base for iPhone applications beyond just C to include .NET and its millions of global developers.Miguel de Icaza, vice president for developer platforms at Novell, explained that MonoTouch is built from the same source code base as Mono, but there are some differences."Mono is a traditional .NET implementation with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler," De Icaza told InternetNews.com. "The iPhone has both a legal and technical limitation for interpreters in general, so we had to modify it."He added that MonoTouch includes a static compiler, which means that there are some dynamic things that developers are used to doing with .NET that they won't be able to do with MonoTouch. In particular, he noted that the add-on IronPython and IronRuby languages do not currently work with MonoTouch.De Icaza added that there is no magic porting tool for traditional .NET applications to run on MonoTouch for the iPhone. The reason is due to the dynamic compiler issues, which can affect software libraries.The 1.0 launch of MonoTouch follows a relatively rapid development cycle from De Icaza and his team. He said the first MonoTouch prototype was completed in early May, and the limited beta program opened up in August. According to De Icaza, there were 600 people in the beta program.With 1.0 now available, the plan is to continue to evolve MonoTouch and add new features over time. Among the features for the MonoTouch 2.0 roadmap is support for Microsoft's Silverlight media framework. Novell has an effort known as Moonlight that provides an open source implementation."MonoTouch is not an open source effort, although the foundation with Mono is," De Icaza said.He added that many of the pieces that are necessary for MonoTouch are not open source. Among those pieces are all the API bindings to the Apple platform. Novell has been working on Mono since 2004 as an open source implementation of the .NET framework. The most recent release is Mono 2.4, which provides performance improvements."MonoTouch is proprietary and I don't feel guilty about that," De Icaza said. "Mono is open source, but on the iPhone we felt that it's a proprietary platform, a very locked down platform and we felt if you're targeting that platform, we might as well make it proprietary as well."

The target release date for the unlock is New Year’s Eve 2008. This unlock method is available to iPhone 3Gs that have 2.11.07 baseband or earlier, we did warn you. You can tell what version baseband you have by going to Settings->General->About->Modem Firmware. The unlock requires a jailbroken 3G iPhone.  It’ll be installable via Cydia, and so it doesn’t matter if you have a Mac or PC. Please refrain from updating your baseband, regardless of what version you’re at.  We’ll have complete directions on New Year’s Eve. We’ll stream a live demo of the unlock before Christmas (see the update at the end of this post).Softpedia doesn't condone jailbreaking / unlocking your iPhone / iPod touch or any other device. Using hacks may render your device unusable, or may considerably reduce the quality of your experience using the respective device. If you choose to download and install the PwnageTool, you do it at your own risk.The iPhone Dev Team, best known for its PwnageTool and QuickPwn hack software, has confirmed the completion of the iPhone 3G unlock. Those interested in jailbreaking their devices are advised not to upgrade to OS 2.2 using iTunes alone.“Over the Christmas break some of our members will be talking at the Chaos Computer Club’s 25C3 Congress,” a Dev-Team Blog post reads. “This talk will be a juicy technical talk relating to iPhone platform and our previous exploits.[...] We have been working hard on a few other things. The main one being the 3G unlock codenamed 'yellowsn0w.' This is now completed and is currently being packaged into a user-friendly application with the simplicity that you see in QuickPwn or BootNeuter.” Some facts for visitors of the blog are also listed. Readers are assumed to be OK with jailbreaks, hence the team's advice of refraining from updating the iPhone 3G's baseband. Read on for the details: It has been recently revealed that the newly-released Mac OS X 10.5.6 update keeps Macs from recognizing the iPhone in DFU mode , making it impossible to jailbreak / unlock it using PwnageTool or QuickPwn. Taking on the DFU Issues in OS X 10.5.6, the Dev Team explains that “Lots of users have been experiencing problems with the use of DFU mode after applying yesterday’s 10.5.6 system update. We believe this behavior is due to a kernel bug not a specific countermeasure by Apple.” The team offers some workarounds, but asks not to be held responsible should anything bad happen. It's probably best if you wait until New Year's Eve to jailbreak your device. Of course, it's probably even better to read the text in red and act accordingly.

Even though most don't expect the next iPhone to be called the "iPhone 5," it looks like Apple is still trying to secure rights to the name.According to Fusible, a blog that monitors domain name purchases, says Apple recently filed a dispute to gain ownership of iphone5.com.Right now, the site is a discussion board about the iPhone. It has no affiliation with Apple.If Apple wins the rights to iphone5.com, it's doubtful the company will use it. Fusible notes Apple owns many other domain names to protect its products.Now check out everything we know about the next iPhone >

Apple has found a new way to get people to agree to online tracking: withhold applications from them if they don't. This week Apple is launching a new iPhone. And with that comes a new operating system and the company's new advertising platform.According to Apple's new privacy policy, users can opt out if they don't want to be served targeted ads. But if they don't want to share their location information with the company, they also won't have access to new apps from the iTunes store.The launch of Apple's iAd advertising system this week comes with some new terms and conditions. Apple will be serving targeted advertising. Users can opt out of receiving such ads, but it won't be particularly easy. And the company thinks it would be cooler if people didn't opt out. According to the new T&Cs:"Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests."Apple customers who want to opt out of tracking have to use the above URL from an Apple device running iOS 4 to do so. And each of their devices using that operating system must be logged out individually.In addition, Apple is collecting "precise," "real-time geographic location" of its customers who use its new iOS software that runs on the new iPhone.Apple's wording assures customers that location data is “collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.” But it also doesn't give people a choice to opt out of location tracking. Users have to agree to the new terms and conditions before downloading new apps or any other data from the iTunes store.Meanwhile, the new T&Cs are light on details regarding what will happen with this location information. The company's privacy policy states:"To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work."Obviously, applications that rely on location will be among the “partners and licensees” who will access location data. But it would be nice to have details on what location-based services other than Find My iPhonewill utilize the data. Apple also insists that the data will be anonymous, but they are not divulging how long the data will be kept, which could irk privacy advocates.

Police have located and spoken to the man who found an iPhone prototype left behind by an Apple engineer at a San Francisco-area bar last month, according to media reports.Stephen Wagstaffe, a San Mateo County District Attorney spokesman, said police in Redwood City have spoken to the man but declined to disclose his name, according to reports by both CNET News and KCBS.In a recorded message on his work phone Wednesday, Wagstaffe said there was nothing new to report on the iPhone case and there was "nothing further to discuss concerning what has gone on so far."Wagstaffe also declined to say if the man is suspected of selling the prototype phone to Gizmodo, an online gadget guide site, the reports said.Last week, the New York Times reported Gizmodo paid the man $5,000 US for the prototype dubbed iPhone 4, 4G or HD in blogs, and posted photos and video of it on April 19 showing its new features, including a camera flash and a second camera for video chatting.Gizmodo editor Jason Chen said the phone had been left at a bar in Redwood City by one of Apple Inc.'s engineers.Chen arranged to return the iPhone when the company posted a letter by its lawyer asking for its return last week.Last Friday, a special computer-crime task force made up of different law enforcement agencies searched Chen's house and car in Fremont, Calif., and took computers, servers and accessories.The search warrant said the computer and other devices may have been used to commit a felony. Investigators also seized Chen's credit card bills and copies of his cheques.Chen's lawyers argue that California's shield law, which protects journalists from having to turn over anonymous sources or unpublished material to law enforcement during a search, should apply to him.

Electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn has denied earlier reports that thousands of workers went on strike on Friday at a plant that assembles Apple’s latest iPhone — reportedly causing production of the device to be “paralysed”. Today Foxconn said no such strike took place and claimed production of the iPhone 5 is on schedule, Reuters is reporting.Earlier reports had suggested 3,000 to 4,000 workers began striking at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou complex on Friday afternoon — with the disputes apparently triggered by “over-exacting quality controls” on iPhone 5 production, compounded by a lack of worker training to meet the new, higher standards. Demands that workers also work through a week-long national holiday also caused tensions to boil over into industrial action, according to reports.But Foxconn Technology Group sent Reuters a statement today denying there had been a strike. It said two brief and small disputes took place at the plant in question, several days earlier, but claimed these were “immediately addressed” and did not escalate into an “employee strike”. Additional staff were also provided for “the lines in question”, it added.“Any reports that there has been an employee strike are inaccurate,” Reuters quotes Foxconn in an emailed statement. Foxconn added that “there has been no workplace stoppage in that facility or any other Foxconn facility and production has continued on schedule”. Employees who worked over the national holiday did so voluntarily, it added.Also in the email, Foxconn said it received instructions from Apple to “strengthen quality inspections” for the iPhone 5 — “following multiple complaints from customers regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone”.We’ve asked Apple to confirm this claim and will update with any response.

Apple is selling the iPhone 3G on its Apple Store Web site in Hong Kong, promising the phones "can be activated with any wireless carrier."The Apple Store in Hong Kong is selling the 8GB and 16GB iPhone 3G models for HK$5,400 (US$695) and HK$6,200, respectively, with free shipping. The store advertises the compatibility of the phones with any carrier, saying, "Simply insert the SIM [subscriber identity module] from your current phone into iPhone 3G and connect to iTunes 8 to complete activation."On the Apple Store's main page for Hong Kong, the site says, "Buy directly from Apple. And choose your carrier.""Customer response to the iPhone 3G has been off the charts, and we are thrilled to offer our customers in Hong Kong another way to get their hands on this revolutionary device," an Apple spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to questions.The company did not comment on whether online iPhone 3G sales and activation will be extended to other markets.The iPhone 3G has been available in Hong Kong since July 11 through Hutchison Telecommunications. The cheapest monthly plan offered by the operator charges HK$2,938 for the 8GB version and HK$3,738 for the 16GB one, along with a two-year contract that costs HK$188 per month.Checks of the Apple Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Singapore, show the iPhone 3G is not available for sale online. Instead, the sites offer a link to a list of stores where the phone is on sale.

Apple's chief foe in the mobile sector and in the courtroom goes after the new iPhone, alleging that the device infringes on eight of its patents.Fresh off a courtroom victory against Apple today, Samsung filed another legal salvo against its chief foe.The Korean electronics giant submitted an amendment to a lawsuit originally filed in April against Apple, adding the iPhone 5 to a list of devices that includes the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the new iPad that Samsung accuses of infringing on several Samsung patents.Samsung reportedly threatened to sue Apple last month for patent infringement over its then rumored use of long-term evolution (LTE) connectivity in the next-generation smartphone. While the new iPhone's debut last month confirmed that Apple's new device featured access to the the speedier fourth-generation wireless networking -- for which Samsung holds numerous patents -- Samsung's latest lawsuit did not address the LTE patentsA Samsung representative told CNET this evening that the eight patents in question include six utility patents and two standard essential patents unrelated to its LTE patent portfolio (see filing below).Echoing previous statements made in the patent dispute, Samsung said, "we have little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights."CNET has contacted Apple for comment and will update this report when we learn more.In a bit of a one-two punch, Samsung added the iPhone 5 as a legal target after a federal judge issued an order dissolving a three-month-old ban on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the U.S. Samsung's once-flagship device was with stipulation that it could be reversed if Samsung was cleared of infringing on an Apple tablet design patent -- which happened during Apple's overwhelming patent victory over Samsung last month.Updated at 10:45 p.m. PT with more information from Samsung.

Smule has done it again. The company behind the ingenious lighter app that took the iPhone by storm a few months ago has launched Ocarina, a networked musical instrument that allows you to listen to songs being played around the world in real time. The app costs 99 cents, and you can grab it here.As an instrument Ocarina has been perfectly executed, and is much more suitable for the iPhone’s screen size than the virtual keyboards and guitars that litter the App Store. To play, you blow into the iPhone’s microphone while fingering notes using the 4 ‘holes’ on the ocarina. Smule says that the microphone can detect subtle variations in air flow, explaining that “unlike other iPhone audio apps, the sound is not pre-compiled but is generated by the notes, gestures and nuance of the individual performer”.And for the vast majority of the population that has no idea how to play an ocarina, the app has another awesome feature: you can listen in on the songs being played on any iPhone worldwide. After selecting the ‘globe’ view, the app presents you with a 3D world littered with a number of little dots presumably representing every active Ocarina. The app will automatically start playing one of these, highlighted by a series of green blobs rising from Earth, each of which corresponds to a note. If you don’t like what you’re listening to, you can hit the ‘next’ button to start playing a new song (you’ll probably be using this button often, as many of the people playing are awful).This is how an iPhone app should be done. As we pointed out in September, too few developers are leveraging the platform’s network effect to differentiate themselves, instead choosing to develop standalone apps that can be easily cloned. By being first to market with this app, Smule has safeguarded itself against the competition: even if another ocarina app comes along that is network compatible, Smule’s application will likely have the largest user base and will be very difficult to catch up with. And if Smule is smart, it’ll keep making these virtual instruments, allowing it to share the same network to create a worldwide orchestra that would be nearly impossible to replicate (and it sounds like it will – the company has developed an audio platform called ChucK that will likely be applied to other instruments).For another app that is trying to tap into the iPhone’s network effect, check out Chess With Friends, which we covered yesterday.

Update: The iPhone 2.0 software is now available. Update 2: Top apps by number of downloads is here.Apple’s iPhone App Store is now live, several hours ahead of its rumored 9 am PST launch. To access it, download iTunes 7.7 here. Once iTunes has upgraded, you can access the App Store here.You can “get apps” on iTunes now, but you’ll need the iPhone 2.0 software to actually use them on the iPhone, which isn’t yet available.There are 27 pages of applications currently available. We’ve updating our directory with the more interesting applications now. At first glance, there are very few non-English applications. Another interesting trend – a lot of books are listed as applications, most for $0.99 (I just bought Heart of Darkness, for example).According to Pinch Media, the App Store had 552 applications at launch. 135 of these apps are free, while the remaining 417 range in price from $0.99 to $69.99, with the vast majority ranging between $0.99 and $9.99.Some people are saying they can’t see the app store even after downloading v 7.7 of iTunes and clicking on the link above. Here’s a qik video I took of the store if you can’t access it yourself:Here are screen shots of the Facebook and MySpace App on iTunes, as well as one of the directory pages:

For those who don't know, Apple and AT&T removed an application that allowed your iPhone to interface with Google Voice. But, in removing GV Mobile from the app store, Apple has cut the application off from any future updates or bug fixes. The reality is that Apple took your money, and has interfered in your ability to get updates to a program you purchased.If you ask for a refund, Apple will happily refund your money, but, here's the stark reality of such a decision... The author, who received 70% of the purchase price when you bought the software, now has to refund 100% of the purchase price when you ask for a refund. In real numbers, The author made $2.09 on a $2.99 program. But, we has to give BACK $2.99--actually costing the author 90 cents for you to get a refund! Apple keeps the 90 cents profit no matter what.So, you want compensation, but you don't want to hurt the author? Here’s what I did.. This hurts APPLE and not the author! I called up apple corporate offices and told them that I want my money back as “compensation” — NOT as a refund. I was very specific that I did not want a refund on the app; that I wanted APPLE to cover my cost. They ended up crediting my account for 5-free song downloads, (Yes, it's a pathetic compensation, but, it’s something.. and it’s something that won’t hurt Sean, but DOES cost Apple money).I spoke to Robert Barger @ Apple Corporate care. You can reach him at 512-674-2500 x 40267. Give him a call and let him know how you feel about what happened.

While the Nokia Lumia 900 is the best Windows Phone currently available, and was formerly a gdgt Must-Have model, we've changed our stance on the phone for one simple reason: Microsoft has announced that current Windows Phone models won't be able to run the next version, Windows Phone 8. Based on this, we can't recommend locking yourself into a two-year contract for a phone that won't be able to take advantage of the latest software long before the end of that term. It's possible that, with deep discounts, you can get a good deal on the Lumia 900 (we've seen it on Amazon Wireless for about $50 with a two-year AT&T contract), and if you're content with the functionality available in Windows Phone 7 (the phone will be updated to at least WP 7.8), it could still be worth buying. But that doesn't make it a Must-Have smartphone.

Services like Ustream and Qik have long offered the promise of live streaming video from your mobile phone to the web — except if you had an iPhone. For those devices, that was only possible if you jailbroke your phone. Not anymore.The Ustream Live Broadcaster has just gone live in the App Store tonight and yes, it allows you to stream live video from the iPhone to the web. And yes, it even works over a 3G connection. And yes, it’s awesome.While one of the key features of the iPhone 3GS was video recording capabilities, that was limited to recordings that were captured on your device and could be uploaded to the web after they were done recording. With the Ustream Live Broadcaster, you can easily record videos right to the web, and allow others to watch them as they’re being recorded. These videos can also be archived so that people can watch them later, if they choose.Settings within the app also make it easy to automatically tweet out when you go live, as well as to do things like share the videos on Facebook and YouTube. The live broadcast can also send out your location, if you’re into that sort of thing. The app also allows for chatting with viewers, and yes/no polling.Ustream has long promised that it would be the first to allow for live video streaming on the iPhone, and it looks like they’ve finally come through — though almost a year after we first wrote about it. They’ve had an iPhone app out for a while, but it hasn’t had live capabilities until now. Qik has had a live-streaming app, but it was only an ad-hoc app, meaning it wasn’t available in the App Store.This Ustream app’s approval follows the approval of another live video streaming app, Knocking, after the developers emailed Steve Jobs personally about its rejection. But that app only does one-to-one streaming, this does one-to-many — full-on broadcast.Find the Ustream Live Broadcaster in the App Store here for free.

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

The CES 2010 did not officially start yet, but the Parrot AR.Drone already made it on my short list of CES 2010 coolest products. The Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter piloted with an iPhone or iPod touch that carries two cameras that deliver live video feed onto your iPhone. How bloody cool is that? (watch video below). Parrot is positioning the Parrot AR.Drone as a video game for the iPhone. It combines wireless, video and gaming technologies to allow real-world objects and conditions, like a tree or wind, to become a part of the video gaming experience.Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter that consists of a central cockpit surrounded by four propellers. One camera located underneath, connects to an Inertial Measurement Unit, which allows the AR.Drone to measure its speed and perform flawless stationary flight. Parrot Smart Piloting (PSP) technology compensates for wind and other environmental conditions during outside flights. For the first time, these technologies, used primarily for professional and military applications, have been adapted to the gaming universe. The second camera, at the front, broadcasts and streams to the iPhone or iPod touch screen, what the AR.Drone sees, as if you were sitting in the cockpit. This allows for the augmented reality gaming experience. The Parrot AR.Drone generates its own Wi-Fi network that simply connects to an iPhone or iPod touch and turns it into a true piloting station. I am not even sure if the U.S. Army has a better drone than this. Pricing has not been announced yet for Parrot AR.Drone. I hope it will be below $200. Parrot launches the iPhone Drone later this year. The company is more known for Bluetooth gear, but with the AR.Drone they could land a huge hit. I certainly want a AR.Drone when it is out for my iPhone. See also these hi-res photos. Game developers are invited to creating games for the Parrot AR.Drone on the open platform that Parrot provides for it. More details can be found on the Parrot AR.Drone site.

(CNN) -- Does a free case fix all the iPhone 4's problems?Not really, says Consumer Reports, the influential product watchdog.Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Friday announced that his company will give iPhone 4 owners free cases to address reception problems caused by the phone's external antenna, which is a metal band around the edge of the phone.Mike Gikas, senior editor for electronics and technology at Consumer Reports, said in an interview that such a patch is a good "first step." But it's still not enough for his group to recommend the phone to consumers."What we were hoping for was a concrete, this-is-it fix for the phone," Gikas said.Consumer Reports made headlines earlier this week for suggesting that iPhone 4 owners would get better phone reception if they put duct tape over the bottom left corner of the phone, where there was a "design flaw" in the antenna.In an effort to address widespread complaints, Apple said it will give a variety of iPhone 4 cases to consumers through September 30.Gikas said such a solution makes it difficult to review the phone, because everyone has a different case, and it's unclear if the solution is permanent; there's a chance the phone could still be recalled after September 30, or that a new version could be issued, he said."When we test a product we try to assume this product is just like all the others that came in boxes just like it," he said, "and we can't do that anymore [with the iPhone 4] because, with the case, this phone is different."During the press event in Cupertino, California, Jobs tried to spread the blame about reception issues across the smartphone industry as a whole.Gikas said that was a bit unfair."The human hand -- the body -- attenuates signal on all phones," he said. "But we haven't seen it happen to the degree that it's happened with the iPhone 4."Previously, Jobs had written an e-mail that said customers should hold the phone differently if they experienced poor reception.On Friday, Jobs skirted around saying there's a problem with the phone's hardware, Gikas said."The most important thing to remember is a problem was discovered with the phone and we can confirm it in a lab, and it was a significant problem," he said."And I don't think Apple fully admitted to it. They acknowledged it and they threw an interim solution at it. But everything spells fogginess about this thing."

Michigan: Police Search Cell Phones During Traffic StopsACLU seeks information on Michigan program that allows cops to download information from smart phones belonging to stopped motorists.The Michigan State Police have a high-tech mobile forensics device that can be used to extract information from cell phones belonging to motorists stopped for minor traffic violations. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan last Wednesday demanded that state officials stop stonewalling freedom of information requests for information on the program.ACLU learned that the police had acquired the cell phone scanning devices and in August 2008 filed an official request for records on the program, including logs of how the devices were used. The state police responded by saying they would provide the information only in return for a payment of $544,680. The ACLU found the charge outrageous."Law enforcement officers are known, on occasion, to encourage citizens to cooperate if they have nothing to hide," ACLU staff attorney Mark P. Fancher wrote. "No less should be expected of law enforcement, and the Michigan State Police should be willing to assuage concerns that these powerful extraction devices are being used illegally by honoring our requests for cooperation and disclosure."A US Department of Justice test of the CelleBrite UFED used by Michigan police found the device could grab all of the photos and video off of an iPhone within one-and-a-half minutes. The device works with 3000 different phone models and can even defeat password protections."Complete extraction of existing, hidden, and deleted phone data, including call history, text messages, contacts, images, and geotags," a CelleBrite brochure explains regarding the device's capabilities. "The Physical Analyzer allows visualization of both existing and deleted locations on Google Earth. In addition, location information from GPS devices and image geotags can be mapped on Google Maps."The ACLU is concerned that these powerful capabilities are being quietly used to bypass Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches."With certain exceptions that do not apply here, a search cannot occur without a warrant in which a judicial officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the search will yield evidence of criminal activity," Fancher wrote. "A device that allows immediate, surreptitious intrusion into private data creates enormous risks that troopers will ignore these requirements to the detriment of the constitutional rights of persons whose cell phones are searched."The national ACLU is currently suing the Department of Homeland Security for its policy of warrantless electronic searches of laptops and cell phones belonging to people entering the country who are not suspected of committing any crime.

The phone maker plans to add Apple's recently unveiled iPhone 5 to its list of accused products, according to a report from Reuters.It appears that Apple's iPhone 5 isn't going to escape the ongoing legal battle with Samsung Electronics.Samsung said it would add the recently unveiled smartphone -- which has already seen record pre-sale figures and which will hit stores tomorrow -- to a list of products accused of violating its patents, according to Reuters, citing U.S. court documents.Samsung confirmed to CNET that it would pursue the iPhone 5.The two companies are in the midst of a bitter legal war over intellectual property. Apple recently scored a big victory over Samsung in a Federal court in San Jose, Calif., but the two companies have several existing lawsuits going on in different countries around the world.Samsung has already taken its case to consumers; the South Korean conglomerate released an ad yesterday slamming the iPhone 5 and people waiting in line for Apple products.Analysts, meahwhile, believe that the iPhone 5 could be poised for record sales spurred by pent-up demand from consumers who skipped the last refresh, the iPhone 4S.CNET has contacted Apple for comment, and we'll update the story when the company responds.Below is the filing from Samsung:Samsung filing

Facebook announced their new app for iPhone, version 3.0 with a hefty feature list. Missing in the list was video capture and upload. Joe Hewitt, a Facebook employee working on the iPhone app tweeted a day after, that video uploading has been implemented in the new Facebook iPhone app – but there’s a catch. You won’t be able to watch your friend’s Facebook videos yet on the iPhone because Facebook videos are encoded in a very high bit rate which the iPhone doesn’t play. This might change in the future though, either through updates to the iPhone OS, or changes made by Facebook to encode videos in an iPhone compatible bit rate.Even without the playback, it’ll be great to use your iPhone 3G S to record and upload videos directly to Facebook. Expect the new app to appear in the App Store this summer.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19 (UPI) --Some iPhone owners have begun reporting a bug that has their handsets showing the wrong date and time, a U.S. tech website reports.The majority of complaints appear to be coming from Verizon iPhone subscribers, Tom's Hardware Guide reported Friday.Some iPhone owners are complaining about the date and time being off by a day, while others report dates off by as much as two weeks."Mine isn't just off by 30 min," one iPhone owner wrote on the Apple Support Communities website. "Today the black one was off by 15 days plus 6 hours and 12 minutes when I pulled it off the charger. The white one is my wife's and she complained yesterday evening that she had to fix the time four times throughout the day.""I've had the phone for about two weeks and have noticed the time drifting slowly off by 3-5 minutes," another user wrote. "Tonight [Tuesday] at 10:40 p.m. it changed itself to September 28th 4:35pm."Many of the complaining owners say the issue is occurring at their home, suggesting inconsistent WiFi or LTE coverage.Several purported fixes have been suggested by users, including changing the date and time updating from automatic to manual, turning off LTE, resetting the device or toggling the Airplane mode.

Fond of gender stereotypes? The study has you covered: women tweet more than men; gals tweet about family and fashion while guys tweet about tech and sports; women like purple backgrounds while men prefer dark ones.The most useful part of the study, however, is that it provides a good view of how ordinary people use Twitter. For instance, it reveals that 25 percent of Twitter users have never tweeted, the average number of followers is 208 and that 81 percent of users have fewer than 50 followers.This is a good reminder that most people don’t use Twitter in the same way as those of us in the media-politics-tech-celebrity-sports bubble. It also appears to confirm BuzzFeed’s John Herman’s theory that “Your Twitter followers aren’t fake, they’re just shy.”It will be interesting to see how Twitter reaches out to this passive population going forward. I’ve tried to persuade family and friends that Twitter is simply a great news service but they’re skeptical. They think, understandably, that Twitter is a club for loud mouths and ask me, “what would I tweet?”As for the study, Beevolve CEO Goldee Udani said by email that the firm was “curious about the demographic make up of Twitter user base, topics that Twitter users found interesting at a macro level and how dense was the Twitter social graph compared to known statistics about Facebook.”You can see the full study, which is presented in clear language and graphics, here.

Computerworld - Hackers can exploit a flaw in Adobe's Flash to compromise nearly every Web site that allows users to upload content, including Google's Gmail, then launch silent attacks on visitors to those sites, security researchers said today.Adobe did not dispute the researchers' claims, but said that Web designers and administrators have a responsibility to craft their applications and sites to prevent such attacks."The magnitude of this is huge," said Mike Murray, the chief information security officer at Orlando, Fla.-based Foreground Security. "Any site that allows user-uploadable content is vulnerable, and most are not configured to prevent this."The problem lies in the Flash ActionScript same-origin policy, which is designed to limit a Flash object's access to other content only from the domain it originated from, added Mike Bailey, a senior security researcher at Foreground. Unfortunately, said Bailey, if an attacker can deposit a malicious Flash object on a Web site -- through its user-generated content capabilities, which typically allow people to upload files to the site or service -- they can execute malicious scripts in the context of that domain."This is a frighteningly bad thing," Bailey said. "How many Web sites allow users to upload files of some sort? How many of those sites serve files back to users from the same domain as the rest of the application? Nearly every one of them is vulnerable."Bailey, who demonstrated how attackers could compromise a Web site and attack users in a post today on Foreground's blog, outlined how a hacker would leverage the Flash flaw. "It's relatively simple," he maintained. "All they need to do is create a malicious Flash object, and upload it to the [Web] server."He used the example of a company that lets users upload content to a message forum to explain the process. "If the user forum lets people upload an image for their avatar, someone could upload a malicious Flash file that looks like an avatar image," Bailey said. "Anyone who then views that avatar would be vulnerable to attack."Adobe has told Foreground that the flaw is "unpatchable," Murray and Bailey said. Instead, Adobe is trying to educate site administrators to close the hole on their end. But they've not had much success.Brad Arkin, Adobe's director for product security and privacy, agreed that the problem can't be solved with a patch to Flash. "We see this as a generic problem that affects any site that allows active scripting, not just Flash, but things like JavaScript and Silverlight as well. Even if Flash figured out some magical safeguard, this would be true for all active content sites that allow users to upload files."

A teardown by IHS iSuppli shows Apple updated most components in the latest device and included some new suppliers.Apple is sticking with most of its component providers for the latest iPhone, an IHS iSuppli teardown shows, but it has made some "critical changes" and updated most chips.A physical teardown by IHS, released today, shows Apple is using parts from many of the usual suspects -- Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Murata, Dialog, Texas Instruments, STMicro, Cirrus Logic, Avago, Skyworks, NXP and AKM.But it also has made some additions, like flash memory maker SanDisk, and almost every component has been updated. And IHS' supplier list indicates a reduced reliance on Samsung, the chip and handset maker that Apple has been battling in court."The iPhone 5 exhibits a great deal of similarity to the iPhone 4S in terms of component suppliers," IHS analyst Andrew Rassweiler said in a statement. "But beyond this superficial resemblance, there are some critical changes to product design and parts that enable major upgrades that improve user experience."Some of those changes include a bigger display and a faster applications processor. And the device uses a 4G LTE chip from Qualcomm that has implications for the iPhone 5 design. Because LTE is more complex, Apple had to create two different models of the newest iPhone to accommodate its wireless carrier partners, IHS says. It only offered a single model for the 4S.Perhaps the biggest winner for the new iPhone -- besides Apple itself -- is SanDisk, which isn't believed to have been a supplier for previous iPhone models. That earlier missed opportunity had hurt the company while rivals like Samsung benefited from their exposure to Apple.Along with flash, the teardown also revealed a different dynamic random access memory supplier than in IHS' 4S analysis -- Elpida. The Japanese DRAM maker is in the process of being bought by rival Micron following Elpida's recent bankruptcy filing. IHS' teardown of the 4S named Samsung as the DRAM supplier, though other analyses have listed Elpida as another memory supplier.It's likely Apple is sourcing DRAM and flash memory from multiple suppliers. IHS notes Samsung, Hynix and Toshiba could be providing flash for certain phones, while Apple could also be buying DRAM from Samsung and Hynix.In other changes, Sony now supplies the battery in the newest iPhone, rather than Amperex Tech like in the iPhone 4S.A preliminary, virtual teardown by IHS last week showed the 16GB version of the iPhone 5 costs $199 for Apple to make, slightly more than the iPhone 4S. The tech research firm today says its physical teardown confirms that cost. Meanwhile, a teardown of Apple's A6 applications processor by iFixit and Chipworksshows the chip to be Apple's first custom-designed processor. Based on ARM Holdings' instruction set, the A6 has two processing cores and three graphics cores.The site also notes that the logic blocks in the chip were likely laid out by hand rather than by using advanced computer software as is typical for most chips today. A manual layout usually results in faster processing speeds, but it's much more expensive and time consuming, iFixit says."It just might be the only manual layout in a chip to hit the market in several years," the site noted.Updated at 12:05 p.m. PT with A6 teardown details from iFixit/Chipworks

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple’s iPhone 4 hasn’t even hit its one-month anniversary yet, but the company has already issued a software update that might fix the death grip problem affecting the device’s antenna.However, despite the fact that iOS 4.1 was made available to developers late yesterday, the Cupertino outfit is keeping quiet until Friday, when it will hold a press conference about the iPhone 4.The update itself has reportedly magnified the phone’s signal bars by making them taller. Whether this actually resolves what many have described as purely a hardware problem remains to be seen.Two weeks ago Apple coughed to a glitch with the way the signal bars are displayed on various iterations of its iPhone that can lead to dramatic drops in reception and bandwidth.The company said it was gobsmacked to have discovered the software flaw, and confirmed it would issue an update within a few weeks.Apparently, by lengthening the signal bars this almighty glitch ought to vanish, but perhaps iPhone 4 owners should sprinkle a little bit of angel dust on the slinky beast too, just for good measure.Meanwhile, until tomorrow (maybe) iPhone punters will be none the wiser about whether iOS 4.1 has saved the device from the evil death grip. That’s because developers sign a non-disclosure agreement with Apple that means details about what’s baked into the update will remain out of the public domain.So, iPhone 4 users, have your signal bars sprouted? Tell us all about it in comments. ®

I just got off the phone with AT&T to figure out my iPhone data plans for the next month.I'm on a family plan, which can be a great discount on the iPhone if you upgrade from your family plan to an iPhone. You only play $9.99 for voice on the additional lines, which is basically a steal. I've had the unlimited data plan since I got my iPhone 3G 2 years ago and assumed that the unlimited data plan also applied to the two non-iPhones in the family plan.So I talk to an unlucky AT&T representative and tried to dissect the possibilities for when I get my iPhone next week:Option 1 I upgrade and keep my current plan Still keep my $30 unlimited plan No tetheringOption 2 I upgrade and change my data plan Change to the 2 gig, $25 plan and add tethering for $10 a month moreSo either I get as much data as I want the way I want to use it, or I get to use my data the way I want, get less and pay more for it.If anyone at AT&T is stupid enough to wonder why people don't like them, they really need to look at money grabs like this.

If anyone taught us the importance of numbers, it was Apple.I don’t know that bloody iPhones and skull icons are the best way to make an argument for more ethical labor policies at factories like Foxconn. And the name “iKill” is just as tacky as it is ineffective at evoking some sort of meaningful emotional response.But numbers? Numbers are powerful things. If anyone taught us that, it was Apple and its contemporaries, hawking gadgets that were twice as fast, half as thin.Do you remember that moment in Harry Potter, when that first amazing feast just appeared on the banquet tables of Hogwarts? Ron practically wet himself in anticipation of his first full belly after years of fighting over scraps at the Weasley dinner table. A skeptic might say it was all too good to be true--how could amazing food just appear--but this was the world of Harry Potter. It was magic.Then in book two, you learned, it wasn’t magic at all! There were just a lot of hard working elves working countless hours to make the whole spectacle possible, and as much as we all loved the late Dumbledore, he was as responsible as anyone for turning a blind eye.That’s where we are now with Apple. The story has gotten less fun, but finally, we can grow up.However magical Apple’s products might be, magic doesn’t exist in this world. Industrial production is an exhausting, horribly paying job by the standards of anyone reading this. Apple isn’t the only Foxconn customer by any stretch, but they are the largest, richest, and most lauded. If Apple is taking it on the chin, it’s only because they have the biggest and, at times, smuggest chin of them all.Stay hungry? Yes. Stay foolish? Sure. But absolutely, stay disgusted, too. Stay angry.Because with $108 billion in revenue a year, Apple has every meaningful resource to make things, not just better, but better than ever. And maybe, just maybe, a company like Apple can do something truly great: make us all believe in magic again.

We all suspected it, but now it is confirmed: someone very, very close to the 3G iPhone launch has told me that Apple will announce their new model at the WWDC Keynote on June 9th. The second-generation iPhone will be available worldwide right after the launch (the worldwide release date is July 11, starting at $199) and not at year's end, as previously thought. The new model will also herald new sales policies in some countries.In Spain, for example, the 3G iPhone will be available for sale at the June 18th (according to our sources, the release date was changed at the last moment by Apple, and it's now July 11) grand opening of Telefonica's megastore—an Apple Store-like shop located in the company's historical building in Madrid's Gran Vía— with nationwide availability the next day or after a few hours. The other European countries with iPhone availability will have similar launch schedules.According to another source involved in the launch, the 3G iPhone will no longer be available at a fixed price point—at least in some countries, and its launch will also bring new sales policies, although these have not been completely specified yet.The move is a logical step, since the iPhone has clearly solidified its position as the cellphone to beat during the last 12 months, and companies in the cutthroat European cellphone market need to use it as an incentive to capture clients aggressively.This most probably means the new 3G iPhone will be integrated in the usual marketing systems of carriers, with point-based trade-ups, discounts for carrier switchers and other service-based subvention packages.

The application is already available for a number of smartphones US telecoms giant AT&T has admitted that it struck a deal with Apple to prevent iPhone applications from using its network for VoIP. VoIP allows voice calls to be routed over mobile internet but reduces a network operator's voice call revenue. Apple and AT&T both responded to a federal inquiry into Apple's failure to approve Google Voice, a VoIP application for the iPhone. Apple said that the app had not been rejected but is still under review. In July, Apple rejected Google's application for the Google Voice app to be sold in its App Store, and removed several third-party applications that employed the same technology. The app is already available on Blackberrys and phones that run both Google's Android and the Symbian operating system. Apple's move prompted an inquiry from the US's Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In AT&T's response to the FCC, the firm said that "AT&T and Apple agreed that Apple would not take affirmative steps to enable an iPhone to use AT&T's wireless service (including 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi) to make VoIP calls without first obtaining AT&T's consent". However, it added that the firms had agreed that "if a third party enables an iPhone to make VoIP calls using AT&T's wireless service, Apple would have no obligation to take action against that third party". AT&T argued that the deal was struck because "both parties required assurances that the revenues from the AT&T voice plans available to iPhone customers would not be reduced by enabling VoIP calling functionality on the iPhone". In its letter to the FCC, Apple said that several VoIP applications such as Skype had already been approved for use over wi-fi wireless networks, rather than over the cellular network. However, it added that the Google Voice app was still under scrutiny because it could "alter the iPhone's distinctive user experience", but added that Google Voice could be accessed via the iPhone's web browser. In its reply to the FCC inquiry, Google argued that "the Google Voice features accessible by the mobile website are more limited than those features found in the App Store version". Those features include direct access to the phone's contact list, or dialling directly from the application.

A new study finds that Apple's smartphone hardware is twice as reliable as that of RIM's BlackBerrys, but it's not the hardware that is the problem with these phones.I love my iPhone and have never felt tempted to return to the BlackBerry, but I was still rolling my eyes at TechCrunch's report of the iPhone being "twice as reliable as the BlackBerry". After all, my iPhone crashed in four different applications in a 45-minute period this afternoon.Of course, the referenced SquareTrade study covers hardware malfunctions, not software malfunctions. In this, perhaps it is true that the malfunction rate for Apple's smartphones after one year is only 5.6 percent, while Research In Motion's phones crap out 11.2 percent of the time.But in day-to-day usage, I've found my iPhone software to be far less stable than the ugly-but-reliable BlackBerry software.As I said, I'm not going back to the BlackBerry, as the iPhone experience, even with less-than-stellar software stability, is still much better than BlackBerry's stodgy dependability. I wouldn't, however, complain if Apple managed to make the iPhone as rock-solid as its OS X software on my MacBook Pro.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureiPhone customers are struggling to install Apple’s latest software patch and have been grumbling about the problems on Cupertino’s support forums.The company released its iOS 4.0.1 update yesterday, and immediately some users began complaining that they couldn’t successfully install it on their iPhones.“On a Win7 PC. Plugged the iPhone 4 in this morning and told there's an update. Ran it, and it errored during the install - I now have a brick. Now had to do a full restore, and I guess I'll have to try again,” wrote a UK punter with the handle DiscoRobbo on Apple’s forum this morning.“So far I've had to restore to factory settings (successfully and now on 4.0.1), but now the phone is having to resync ALL my data - which will take a while,” DiscoRobbo added later.Many customers have been reporting firmware problems with the update, which keeps spewing out ‘error 9’ messages.iPhone customer PaulDev said that an Apple rep gave him the following explanation for what had gone wrong.“Error 9: This error occurs when the device unexpectedly drops off of the USB bus and communication stops. This can occur if the device is manually disconnected during the restore process. This issue can be resolved by performing USB isolation troubleshooting, using a different USB dock connector cable, trying another USB port, restoring on another computer, or by eliminating conflicts from third-party security software.”“Maybe you touched the USB cable in the lower left corner. ‘Don't hold it that way’, okay? Apparently flaky mobile signals weren't enough, with 4.01, they've upgraded wired connections to have the same brilliant reliability was wireless,” he said.Having read the forum gripes some decided to altogether steer clear of Apple’s update.“After reading 8 pages of #applefail I think I will hold off updating for now and wait for today's press conference. Pls note however my apple bumper does not solve the reception drop issue,” said georgeyoung on Apple’s forum.Apple has remained characteristically quiet about this latest in a series of complaints from unhappy fanbois disappointed with their iPhone 4 devices.The company will be holding a press conference later today about the iPhone 4. It's been reported that Apple won't be recalling the slinky beast, despite the antenna problems that may have prompted the quick iOS 4.0.1 update release yesterday. ®

Deutsche Telekom users just wanted to preorder a new iPhone 5. Instead they got phone sex. Nope, it’s not April Fools’ Day. It’s just a Friday. You can’t make this stuff up.Since Deutsch Telekom is Apple’s partner for Germany, the company was able to offer customers a voucher which would guarantee they could buy Cupertino’s latest and greatest. Germans with the carrier called the number provided to them via a text message. What they didn’t know was that Deutsche Telekom had royally screwed up, no pun intended. The number was one digit too long and thus resulted in connecting callers with an adult dating hotline advertised as “hot dating fun.”“We really regret what happened and have already apologised to our customers,” a Telekom spokesman said in a statement to Die Welt (via The Local). Once it realized its mistake, the German telecommunications company sent out a second text with an apology for the mistake and the correct preorder hotline number.Thankfully, this story has a happy ending. No, I’m not talking about that; get your head out of the gutter! Since a call to any 0800 number is free, the customers were not charged for Deutsche Telekom’s faux pas.If you’re lucky, preorders made today will ship on September 21, when the device will also go on sale in Apple Stores and other retail stores. Unfortunately, that date will likely be pushed back as Apple is having trouble dealing with demand. The craziness isn’t as high in Germany as it is in the US (where the iPhone 5 reportedly sold out in an hour), but Deutsche Telekom did say that customers had to call an average of three times just be connected with one of their employees.Read also: Apple’s iPhone 5 now available to preorder in select launch countries

It's that time again. The first-generation technology is being replaced, and even some of the ecogeekiest folks in the world simply can't stand to have an outdated cell phone. So, if you simply can't stand the slow speeds and lower-cost service plan of your old first generation iPhone...what's the best way to dispose of it?It turns out that there are a lot of answers to that question. Since we at EcoGeek are maniacally concerned about these things, we've decided to put together a list (in order of greenness) of what you can do with your old iPhone (and, by extension, most electronic devices.)And for those precious few ecogeeks who want to actually downgrade to a more environmentally friendly, low power option. You can actually sell your in-demand iPhone, and buy a green phone for far cheaper.

Apple said in an email invitation on Thursday that it will provide a "sneak peek" at the iPhone 3.0 software, along with information about the new software kit that third-party vendors use to create applications for the device.The company will host the event at its corporate campus in Cupertino, California, on March 17.Apple released its 3G iPhone last summer and the device proved to be an immediate hit with consumers. Apple sold 6.9 million devices in the September quarter and 4.3 million in the December quarter.The iPhone is one of Apple's main engines for growth. Over the course of 2008, the company sold over 13.7 million iPhones, ahead of its 10 million target.Key to the iPhone's success has been the applications offered through the company's App store, which launched last July. The store features a wide array of programs, some for free and some for a fee.In January, Apple said more than 500 million applications had been downloaded and that more than 15,000 apps were available.Shares of Apple rose $3.07, or 3.3 percent, to $95.75 in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

It is being viewed as a significant development as it is the first time that the smartphone industry’s high-stakes patents wars have affected iPhone users directly by restricting the capabilities of their handset.Push notifications for iCloud and MobileMe services were disabled last night, Apple told German users. To get their email, contacts and calendar updates, users will have to collect it manually or set their iPhone to make regular checks.It follows Motorola’s victory in a court case last month. At the time, Apple dismissed the relevant patent as an “old pager patent” and vowed to appeal the decision.“Apple believes this old pager patent is invalid and we’re appealing the court’s decision,” it said.Today it added: "This ruling only impacts customers in Germany who use a push setting to get their MobileMe and iCloud email. These customers will still receive email to their devices."Motorola is engaged in several legal battles with Apple, as part of the broader patent wars. Last week a court in Munich ordered it not to include a “slide to unlock” feature in its future smartphones, after Apple successfully claimed it infringed an iPhone patent.Google’s last year decided to spend $12.5bn to acquire Motorola because of its portfolio of thousands of smartphone patents. The search giant plans to use the armoury to defend the Android operating system from attacks by Apple, Microsoft and others.Apple this week complained to the European Commission that Motorola was failing to meet its so-called FRAND obligations, which require firms to licence standard technology to rivals on fair terms. Officials in Brussels are already investigating Samsung on similar allegations.But according to Florian Mueller, a German intellectual property expert who tracks the patent wars, Motorola’s “old pager patent” is unlikely to come under the scope of any European Commission investigation because it is not cover standard technology.“This is the first time that Apple's customers have started to see and feel the effects of the ongoing patent disputes in the smartphone and tablet computer industry in the form of a removal of certain functionality,” he said.“The patent that now affects Apple's push email service in Germany does not appear to be essential to any industry standard.”Germany, Europe’s largest smartphone market, has become the frontline in the patent wars because of its relatively speedy court process and because the winner in an intellectual property case is often granted a potentially disruptive injunction against the loser.

The discovery that gripping the iPhone 4 in a way that bridges the left and bottom antennas can cause serious signal problems has resulted in—to say the least—a lot of controversy. However, most of the data that either "proves" or "refutes" that existence of said problem has been anecdotal at best. So AnandTech used a clever hack to get an iPhone 4 to report actual signal strength instead of "bars," giving some quantitative data about how bridging the antennas can negatively affect signal strength. The analysis explains why not all users are affected by the problem, and further investigation also shows that the antenna design does in fact improve reception as long as the left-bottom area isn't bridged when holding the device.Other mobile handsets definitely have antenna attenuation problems—when cupping an iPhone 3GS or Google Nexus One in the manner that causes problems with the iPhone 4, AnandTech measured 14dB and 18dB drops, respectively. However, the problem with the iPhone 4's external antenna is worse; bridging the antennas detunes 3G reception by a full 24dB.As long as you have a signal strong enough to show five bars on your iPhone 4—between ?51dBm and ?91dBm—a 24dB drop in signal strength shouldn't drop your call or data connection. However, Apple only uses a very small range of signal strength for showing four or less bars, from ?91dBm down to the usable signal cutoff of ?113dBm. If your iPhone displays four bars or less, a 24dB attenuation will cut the signal below the useable limit.That's definitely a significant problem—one that Apple has so far failed to address adequately, in our opinion—but there is good news in all of this. AnandTech also discovered that the iPhone 4 can actually use signal at the lower threshold far more reliably than any previous iPhone. "It's readily apparent that the new baseband hardware is much more sensitive compared to what was in the 3GS," according to Anand Shimpi. "The difference is that reception is massively better on the iPhone 4 in actual use."Rumors have suggested that Apple has an update to iOS 4 coming soon that may address the issue, and an e-mail from Steve Jobs to a frustrated customer seems to support that theory. A reader indicated to us via e-mail that Apple may be using digitally adjustable solid state capacitors to tune the iPhone 4's antennas, which if true would make a software fix possible.While Apple has yet to externally admit there is a problem, the company is definitely looking to beef up its on-staff expertise in antenna engineering—ironically posting job listings for mobile antenna engineers on the same day that the iPhone 4 problems were discovered. Until Apple does offer an official fix (assuming one can be made), using some type of case, or alternately covering the gap between antennas on the bottom left corner with some type of insulating material, is the only reliable solution if you're affected by this problem.

Skype has launched its video-calling service for the Apple iPhone, a week earlier than many expected – with more announcements from the VoIP specialist due at CES 2011 in Las Vegas early next month.So if you have an iPhone 4 and want to make Skype-to-Skype video calls with others (either on their iPhones or PCs/Macs) then you can grab the latest version of Skype's iOS app from iTunes today.The video calling app will work over Wi-Fi or 3G, although initial tests show that the video quality and stuttering on 3G video calls are somewhat compromised when compared with the smooth flowing moving images on Wi-Fi."Video calling significantly enhances the user experience of Skype for iPhone, which is one of the top five free iPhone apps in 2010 according to Apple," said the company."Now, users can make and receive free Skype-to-Skype calls, call mobiles and landlines around the world at very low rates, and now share more moments together with video on Skype for iPhone,"The new Skype for iPhone app will also work with the with the iPhone 3GS, and iPod touch 4th generation with iOS 4.0 or above – although obviously only allowing the caller to send video from the single camera on the back of the phone or iPod in those cases.iPod touch 3rd generation and iPad will both be able to receive video calls, but not send them, due to the lack of video-shooting capabilities on those devices.Most excitingly, for many Skype users, video calls can now be made between your PC or Mac laptop or desktop and your iOS device.Your desktop client will need to be Skype for Windows 4.2 or above (or Skype for Mac 2.8 and above) – plus the app will also work with other desktop clients and devices such as Skype for Linux and the Asus-manufactured standalone Skype Videophone.The Skype for iPhone application is freely available to download from the Apple App Store – for more head to www.skype.com/go/iphone

A lot has changed in Apple’s new iPhone. But with the Verizon Wireless and Sprint versions of the iPhone 5, there’s something that will remain the same from the old model: The phone still won’t be able to place a call and handle data activity over the cellular network at the same time.Older Verizon and Sprint smartphones on 3G networks were not able to handle simultaneous calls and data because of a limitation in CDMA, the 3G technology that those networks use. But now some Verizon 4G LTE smartphones will let you stay on a phone call while looking up something in an app or checking e-mail. So why not the iPhone 5?Brenda Raney, a Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, said it was Apple’s decision to design the iPhone 5 so that customers could make voice calls and do Internet activity simultaneously only over Wi-Fi, not over Verizon’s cell network. “The iPhone 5 is designed to allow customers to make voice calls on the Verizon Wireless network and surf the Web on Wi-Fi,” she said in an e-mail. “It was an Apple decision.”The explanation for this, it turns out, is complicated. The technology in 4G LTE networks does not currently handle voice transmissions; it only does data. So when you place a phone call on a 4G LTE smartphone, it’s actually rolling back to the carrier’s older second- or third-generation network, according to AnandTech, a Web publication that does deep analysis on hardware.That means when AT&T customers place a phone call and use data on the iPhone 5, both functions will roll back to AT&T’s older network, which can handle them simultaneously. When you place a phone call while using data in an app with a Verizon or Sprint iPhone 5, it will roll back to their older CDMA networks, which are not capable of simultaneously doing calls and data. And that’s why the iPhone 5 on Verizon and Sprint, despite being a 4G LTE device, will still not do both at the same time.An Apple spokeswoman, Natalie Kerris, put it this way: “iPhone 5 supports simultaneous voice and data on GSM-based 3G and LTE networks. It is not yet possible to do simultaneous voice and data on networks that use CDMA for voice and LTE for data in a single radio design.”So why does Verizon’s Samsung Galaxy S III, a 4G LTE phone, juggle calls and data? Samsung added an extra antenna so that it pulls data from the 4G LTE network at the same time that it’s using another antenna to do voice, said Anand Shimpi, editor in chief of AnandTech.Then why didn’t Apple add another antenna? Its phone already has two antennas in an effort to improve reception, and it would have had to add a third antenna just for Verizon and Sprint phones to give them simultaneous data and calls, Mr. Shimpi explained. Leaving that third antenna out allows Apple to simplify the process of manufacturing the iPhone for multiple carriers. Plus, in the next two years, 4G LTE technology is supposed to evolve to support voice calls, which would render another antenna unnecessary.Whew! Despite that explanation, the ability to do calls and data at the same time was one of the major things that AT&T’s iPhone customers had that Verizon’s and Sprint’s didn’t. And for now, that story remains the same with the iPhone 5 — which may be a consideration for customers considering a new phone on those networks.

From a user’s perspective there is not much difference between a smartphone and a tablet. Both devices are portable touch-screen computers, and while the a smartphone might have a dedicated dialing application by default, the ability to make voice calls or connect to a cellular network is not an exclusive feature. However, thanks to U.S. Copyright law the difference between an iPhone and an iPad is not just the screen size, it is the freedom to install software without a gatekeeper.The Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), passed in 1998, banned the circumvention of technology tailored to protect copyright. Due the the potential for these digital locks to prevent otherwise legal practices, such as transferring the music from  CD to your computer, the DMCA instructed the U.S. Copyright office to consider exemptions to the law every three years.In 2010, the last year that exemptions were published, the U.S. Copyright Office ruled (PDF) that installing the software of your choice in your mobile device would be exempt from the DMCA. Jailbreaking and rooting, modifying the software of iOS and Android devices, respectively, to modify the operating system, delete unnecessary applications, or simply install applications that might not be available in the designated application stores, became officially legal.This past October the U.S. Copyright Office issued the latest decision (PDF) in this triennial rulemaking, extending the exemption for jailbreaking and rooting for smartphones but not expanding the same freedom to tablet users. As a result two very similar devices with the same processor, operating system, and dedicated application store offer very different degrees of freedom.The ruling also rolled back the freedom to circumvent digital locks in order to unlock a handset. In the United States wireless carriers often sell mobile devices that are restricted to operate on a limited number of wireless networks. This prevents users from taking their phone with them to another carrier or even using a different SIM card when traveling abroad. In 2006 the Copyright Office granted an exemption allowing users to unlock their own device, an exemption that was extended in 2010. The most recent rule-making eliminated this exemption and starting in January 2013 users will technically violate copyright if they unlock their smartphone without their carriers’ permission.Although the recent DCMA rulemaking primarily impacts U.S. users, the U.S. has actively pushed other countries to adopt restrictions against circumventing copyright protections including through trade agreements such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which was rejected by the European Parliament but recently passed in Japan. Similar language has also been included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (PDF).Combined, these efforts are a stark reminder on how copyright protections can extend beyond media and capture the basic freedoms of control over the devices we purchase and use.

In Apple's mind, here's how it was all supposed to play out: Samsung loses in court, and customers see a bad-nasty-bad company that steals ideas. Who wants a cheap knock-off, anyway?Funny thing is, it seems that the Apple v. Samsung trial actually had a very favorable effect on Samsung, because it has been selling GSIII's like hotcakes ever since. In fact, according to a new study by Localytics, sales of the device grew by 16% during the week of the Apple verdict. Ha!Instead of seeing Samsung as an inferior knock-off company, consumers actually took notice. If Apple thought Samsung's products were good enough to take them to court over, then they mustbe a viable option, right? Customers have clearly spoken.To add insult to injury, Samsung saw its next spike in GSIII sales - up by 15% - during the week of Apple's iPhone 5 announcement. Unhappy iPhone owners? People unimpressed with the 5? Or perhaps it's just because that's around the time when Samsung really kicked its new advertising campaign into high gear.It's hard to say what the realreason is. Either way, though, this is probably not the sort of result Apple was expecting.

While China sees nothing near the frenzy of the first U.S. iPhone launch day, crowds there do honor the tradition of lining up for the phone hours in advance. But price--and a lack of Wi-Fi--could prove a deterrent.It could be the Year of the iPhone in China, as Apple officially started selling its iconic smartphone in the world's largest mobile market Friday night.While China saw nothing near the frenzy of the first iPhone launch day here in the U.S., crowds there did honor the tradition of lining up for the phone many hours in advance at several locations. A few hundred people queued up in the rain and cold outside The Place shopping center in Beijing, for example. There, Zhi Xianzhong became the first person to get the iPhone from Apple partner China Unicom after waiting 7 hours and 40 minutes, according to China Daily.As expected, China Unicom, the country's second largest telecom operator after China Mobile, is selling two versions of the iPhone in China under a three-year deal with Apple. But cost could prove to be a deterrent. Prices range from 4,999 yuan (about $732) for the 8GB 3G model to 6,999 yuan (about $1,025) for the 32GB 3GS phone (sans contract).Consumers can get cheaper, cracked, gray-market iPhone models at local electronics stores or bring them in from other markets. But price isn't the only potential obstacle here. In accordance with Chinese government regulations, the handsets also lack a key feature--Wi-Fi capability, though reports say China Unicom hopes to offer Wi-Fi-enabled iPhones within a few months.China Unicom is starting off by selling the iPhone in 285 cities. The carrier hopes to sell 5 million devices in three years, according to Chinese news reports, but the company wouldn't confirm that figure.

Deep within the bowels of the iPhone OS are some property list files that describe the capabilities of the various iPhone and iPod touch models. According to a reader with access to the latest iPhone OS 3.0 developer beta, there is a plist file for a new, unknown device.Our source believes that the new device, referred to as N18AP, may represent updated iPod touch hardware. The plist for the second-generation iPhone (N82AP), for instance, simply includes the plist for the original and lists the updated features—like GPS and 3G capabilities. Likewise, the plist for the second-generation iPod touch (N72AP) includes the plist for the original and lists only the updated features.That leads us to the new discovery. The plist file for N18AP apparently includes the plist for N72AP, the second-gen iPod touch, leading to the speculation that the device is an updated iPod touch model. The only new capability listed, however, is "encode-aac."How this capability might relate to new features is not known. It's easy to speculate that it could include a recording feature, but the current iPod touch can already do that. All we can say for certain from this information is that Apple has some device similar to an iPod touch that can encode AAC format audio and is expected to run iPhone OS 3.0. If or when it will appear as a new product, however, is known only to Apple.

Google Android has one of the best features designed for Google maps. Makes sense, doesn’t it? But while the newly released Android is getting all the hype in the news as of late, it seems Apple isn’t going to let Google get away with that title just yet. With the software 2.2 update, the iPhone will now support Google Street View as well as mass transit directions. With this feature, people will be able to view their actual surroundings so they can get a better sense of where they need to go. The mass transit feature is especially helpful for those who commute on a daily basis and need to catch those buses on time.It wasn’t too long ago that a map was the confused traveler’s staple — you’d stare at it for what seemed like hours, dimly aware of your orientation or distances, unable to fold it back into it’s designed shape.With all the advances in technology over the last few years, we’ve gotten to the point where the map has become cumbersome, replaced by slick-thin devices which not only give you an idea of your surroundings, but also the local fare.With Google Maps applications such as Street View and mass transit directions, it my be only a matter of time before the standard changes once again. Just think, we won’t have to pull out our phones anymore to look up the stop we missed. There could even be interactive touch screen maps on the bus itself. Although the software update is another step towards a future of incredible ease, it will be interesting to see what will come out in the next five years that could make this obsolete.

[From Christoph J. Landers] Hi Sammy, People on the internet are talking a lot about the Palm-Apple-Patent-showdown, and I just wanted to share my opinion on the matter with fellow Palm-users. I love PalmAddict, and read it quite a lot (it's one of the few blogs on the internet that I actually read at least once a day). Good Job.It's fun to read the comments iPhone-users made about the Palm Pre. Particularly how it's just a cheap imitation that rips-off their beloved device. More importantly, that the Pre Palm blatantly steals from Apple, and Palm should be sued. The question - of course - these iPhone-people should ask themselves is this: how stupid do you think Palm is? - Sure one of the goals of Palm is to find the holes in Apple's newly granted patents...but that's the way the game is played: if you are able to pass through a hole in someone's description of their IP than that is your right. You may even patent that hole yourself. To give an example...In Apple's patent it is stated that: "In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, the device 100 may include a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from the touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen." [Read more]AppleInsider pointed out that "Interestingly, this is a feature Palm is already touting about its upcoming Pre handset. According to Palm's press release: "[The Pre has a] gesture area, which enables simple, intuitive gestures for navigation." The gesture area is separate from the touch screen." [Read more]iPhone-users are eager to point out that Palm is in violation of the Apple patent. But they are wrong. They are wrong simply because Apple presented a hole, and Palm decided to use that: the patent clearly states that the touchpad 'does not display visual output'. So what did Palm do? - They created a gesture area that DOES display a visual output: if you touch it, it lights up (this was clearly said by Palm during their introduction of the Pre, and you can see it on some of the demos on YouTube). Light is visual, and it is an output. So when we compare it to Apple's patent the question rises: "is this a touch-sensitive area that is separate from the touch screen and does not display a visual output?" - for if it is, then Palm's gesture area is illegal. The answer is simple: no. Yes it's touch-sensitive, and yes it's separate from the touch screen, but no, it is not NOT display visual output. And that means that Apple's lawyers will have a hard time proving that this is still part of Apple's IP.My guess is, that Palm has spend a lot of time on finding the holes in Apple's patent (proposal) and has spend even more time on playing with the holes in it. And from the looks of it, Palm did a great job...and these iPhone-people know it, and that's what they are most afraid of.

A security flaw in Apple Inc.'s iPhone allows unauthorized users to gain easy access to private contacts and e-mails even when the device is locked, but the company said a fix is on the way.Popular technology blog Gizmodo and an online forum run by the Mac Rumors site showed that it took only three taps to gain access to locked iPhones, which run the latest 2.02 iPhone software.A spokeswoman said in an e-mail that Apple was aware of the problem and was readying a software update to fix it. In the meantime, she recommended users set the iPhone's "Home" button to open up the phone's iPod music collection rather than the phone's "Favorites" menu.The flaw could be seen as a momentary setback in Apple's ambitious plans to compete against Research In Motion, whose BlackBerry smart phone has become a standard issue device in corporate businesses around the globe.Earlier in August, technology research firm Gartner issued a report that said iPhone's software had met Gartner's minimum requirements for business support, although some issues persisted. The author of the report, Ken Dulaney, was not immediately reachable.Last week, Apple released a software update for the iPhone that reportedly helped fix problems connecting to faster third-generation (3G) wireless networks, after receiving a flurry of online complaints from customers around the world.

A Samsung official has reportedly denied claims that the company has raised the priceit charges Apple for its iPhone and iPad processors by almost 20 percent. Speaking with Korean newspaper The Hankyoreh, the unnamed official added that prices were agreed upon at the beginning of each year and "aren't changed easily."Monday's report in rival paper Chosun claimed Apple and Samsung have a supply agreement that runs through to 2014, and unless "special cost factors" were involved, unit prices have traditionally stayed level.

So word on the street (literally) is that a large number of people are queuing in line outside of Apple's flagship store on 5th Avenue in New York City (see above) -- keep in mind the Cube is open 24 hours a day. Our intrepid girl-on-the-scene reports that the group is more than 60-deep, though most people seem confused about what they're waiting for, while some believe they're actually camping out for a 3G iPhone. Meanwhile, Apple reps tell us they're crowd-controlling iPhone buyers because otherwise they would be "screaming" at employees and clogging up the store. See what happens when you get short on stock? More pics after the break. For those of you convinced this is an Improv Everywhere stunt, here's a post from Charlie Todd -- the group's founder -- denying involvement.[Thanks, Laura and Abiade]

On the Hong Kong-to-Singapore leg of my SQ1 flight from San Francisco, a B777 aircraft, an air steward noticed my iPhone connected to the in-seat USB port.He then told me I couldn't charge my iPhone this way. It seems it's not a question of not enough juice in that port but because the USB port does not have a circuit breaker and will keep charging even when the battery is full. Apparently it may overload the circuits or something.I even offered to disconnect my iPhone when it was full but he wouldn't have any of it. So I disconnected my iPhone from the USB port.This is new to me. I have seen many people use it, myself included, without being told off.It seems strange to me that you would design a plane with a USB port that cannot do what normal USB ports on computers do.Anyways, I just switched to charging via the in-seat power socket (good thing I had my iPhone charger head with me).So these SQ USB ports, are they only good for flash drives? Strangely, their Krisworld magazine touts connecting your iPhone to the Krisworld system to access your own movies and music via the in-seat screen and the connection method? The USB port.They did have an asterisk on the iPhone bit that stated "On Selected Aircraft Only". So maybe my B777 was not one of the "Selected Aircraft".Maybe Singapore Airlines can go to Sim Lim Square and pick up new USB ports for these planes. I heard got offer.

The 21-year-old California man who found a prototype iPhone and then sold it to gadget site Gizmodo.com says he now regrets not attempting to return the phone to its rightful owner.Talking through his lawyer yesterday, he admitted to Wired.com that he was paid by Gizmodo for what he believed was exclusive access to review the iPhone and that the site told him “there was nothing wrong in sharing the phone with the tech press.”“He regrets his mistake in not doing more to return the phone,” says Bornstein’s statement. “Even though he did obtain some compensation from Gizmodo, Brian thought that it was so that they could review the phone.”The finder of the phone has been interviewed by police, but not yet charged. However, the cloud is not gone from over his head just yet.The person who found the phone “is very definitely one of the people who is being looked at as a suspect in theft,” San Mateo County Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe told Wired.com Wednesday. “Assuming there’s ultimately a crime here. That’s what we’re still gauging, is this a crime, is it a theft?”The finder made no direct effort to return the iPhone himself, though reports claim that a friend of his attempted to contact AppleCare to no avail. According to the owners of the bar where it had been found, he never told anyone there that he’d found the phone. If he had, he’d have learned that the Apple engineer who’d lost it had come back to the bar on several occasions to see if it had been found yet.As reported earlier this week, police searched the home of the Gizmodo editor who wrote the story.“This thing has gotten completely, completely out of control,” said the iPhone finder’s lawyer. “He made a mistake… He should have just immediately turned that phone in.”

TORONTO - Shares of Research In Motion (TSX:RIM) shot up six per cent after the BlackBerry-maker announced plans to offer software to companies and governments, allowing them to use Apple and Android smartphones and tablets on its secure network.RIM said the service, named BlackBerry Mobile Fusion, will be available in March after a test run with some of its business customers.Shares in RIM were up $1.01 to $18.02 in early morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.The move is intended to help RIM encourage its corporate customers to stick with its services, even as some move away from BlackBerry devices.The Waterloo, Ont., tech company has been losing consumer marketshare to Apple and Android devices and although it's still dominant in workplaces, its competitors are making inroads.

Apple was warned as long ago as 2010 that the popular Gowalla location-sharing iPhone app was uploading users' address books without alerting them, Technology Review has learned.This raises questions about why Apple didn't do then what it announced it would do yesterday. In a statement, the company said software upgrades for iPhones would be issued to protect users from the practice, which is forbidden.Apple's statements follow a series of revelations over the past week concerning apps that access users' address books. The revelations began when an independent developer discovered that the two-million-user-strong social network Path collects users' address books, assembling vast collections of names, e-mails, and phone numbers without consent. Others found that some other popular apps, including the location-sharing services Foursquare and Gowalla, do the same. Transmitting and storing users' address books exposes them to an increased risk of their personal data being leaked, perhaps through an attack like the one that extracted credit-card details from Sony last year.The criticism that followed these discoveries—compounded by evidence that Apple ignored a warning about such behavior from academic researchers in 2010—has led to calls for the company to alter iOS and reform its famously opaque application approval process.In the longer term, all smart-phone operating systems may need more effective privacy controls to better explain what personal data they collect, and to let users opt out. Google's Android mobile operating system already requires apps to receive explicit permission to access contact books or other private data, but app makers do not need to explain how that information will be stored or used, and many users seem not to fully understand what they are handing over.In 2010, graduate student Manuel Egele and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara, used a tool called PiOS to scan 1,400 iPhone applications for signs that they leaked sensitive user data. PiOS flagged Gowalla's app because it stealthily uploaded a user's entire address book to the company's servers when a user viewed his or her list of phone contacts through the app.That was a clear breach of user privacy, and of Apple's own rules for inclusion in the App Store, says Egele, now a postdoctoral researcher at UCSB. But when Apple was contacted about it, a series of representatives showed little interest, he says. "We even took screenshots that showed it was being sent unencrypted," he says. "They said, 'If you have a privacy concern, you should contact the developer.' " Egele and colleagues presented a peer-reviewed paper on the work, including an account of their Gowalla finding, last year.Apple did not reply to inquiries about the 2010 incident. But its first public statement on the address-book saga, made yesterday, implied that it had only just become aware of the issue.

Seventeen mobile phone manufacturers and operators have committed to develop standard for universal cell phone chargers by 2012.The initiative, led by the European mobile communications organization GSMA, seeks to adopt a universal connection and a common energy-efficient format that could result in an estimated 50 percent reduction in standby energy consumption and tens of thousands of tons of duplicate chargers.The group said phones would have a micro USB interface, currently used by some phones and by other devices such as digital cameras.Universal chargers would also make life easier for consumers, the GSMA said. Phones could be shipped cheaper, with no charger cord, since eventually most consumers would have one. And consumers would not be left with drawers of old chargers to sort through.Some of the industry’s biggest players are not included in the group, however, including Cupertino-based Apple Inc., whose popular iPhone uses a proprietary 30-pin cable; Sunnyvale-based Palm Inc.; and Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry smart phone tops the market.The companies that have joined the initiative are AT&T, KTF, LG, mobilkom austria, Motorola, Nokia, Orange, Qualcomm, Samsung3 Group, Sony Ericsson, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, T-Mobile and Vodafone.

The bizarre gathering, which morphed into a spirited Michael Jackson "Thriller" dance routine, marked the completion of its Windows Phone 7 software, and showed how badly Microsoft wants to resurrect itself in the viciously competitive phone market.The new software, which will be publicly unveiled on October 11 and expected on handsets in stores by November, is Microsoft's last chance, some analysts say, to catch up with Apple and Google Inc's Android smartphones, after squandering its strong market position in only a few years.A group of smartphone manufacturers including Samsung and HTC Corp are expected to roll out Microsoft-based phones for the holiday season.Whether they will be good enough to render the iPhone obsolete is the question."The product can't be an also-ran that just does everything that is already out in the marketplace," said Bryan Keane, an analyst for Alpine Mutual Funds, which holds Microsoft shares. "Right now, it isn't apparent that Windows 7 is better than anything that's out there, except that it might have a better tie-in to the actual Windows platform."By the admission of Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, the company "missed a generation" with Windows Mobile, its last phone operating system, which floundered while the iPhone and Android roared past with sumptuous touch screens and a host of new applications.Microsoft is now fourth in the fast-growing U.S. market for smartphone operating systems with a share of less than 12 percent, according to research firm comScore, behind BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd, Apple and Google.Microsoft's strange disappearance from the phone market, and its delayed response to the emergence of tablet devices like Apple's iPad, has been seen as a drag on Microsoft's shares, which are down 20 percent this year."The market is really fearful of their positioning in those two markets (phones and tablets)," said Ken Allen, Baltimore-based portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, which holds Microsoft shares. "Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock."Investors were not impressed with Microsoft's last attempt to launch a new phone, the Kin, which was dropped after fewer than three months on the market.Whether the new phones can make up for that error and lift concerns will depend on how the handsets measure up and how much the network carriers promote the phones.Prototypes of the new devices, which have been demonstrated by Microsoft employees over the past few months, look to be a huge improvement over the last version of Microsoft's phone software. They have a touch-screen interface resembling the company's Zune music player and movable 'tiles' that access various phone functions.But at first glance, they don't appear to offer radical new features that rivals lack.Launch phones are expected from Samsung, LG and HTC Corp, while AT&T Inc is expected to be the initial U.S. network provider, according to a person familiar with the launch plans. Microsoft and AT&T declined comment. None of the handset makers immediately replied to requests for details.All three of those phone makers already offer Android-based phones, while AT&T is currently the sole carrier for the iPhone, which means none has too much riding on the success of the new software, which could be a problem for Microsoft."We'll have to see how much vendor support (Microsoft) gets behind it -- that was partially what drove Android success," said Keane at Alpine. "But now, their problem is, 'We already have Android and the iPhone, do we need a third one?'."

It's always refreshing to hear the head of a major corporation cop to past mistakes -- particularly in front of a large crowd of on-lookers. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson admitted some misgivings about the way the carrier handled iPhone data, telling a crowd at the Milken Institute's Global Conference in Los Angeles, "My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat." Stephenson drove the point home by adding, "Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital."And, for the record, that certainly wasn't the only thing about the iPhone that kept the exec up at night. Stephenson again,You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model," he said. "Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you're using iMessage, you're not using one of our messaging services, right?No one ahead said it was easy being the chief.

A Scottish IP firm is suing Apple over the smooth zooming and scrolling featured on the iPhone.Glasgow-based patent licenser Picsel Technologies says the Cupertino iDevice maker illegally uses display technologies it developed. The firm sued Apple on Friday in Delaware District Court.Picsel claims Apple infringes on its US patent 7,009,626, titled "Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing."The patent describes using an approximate, intermediary rendering of what's displayed on a device while scrolling, zooming, or during other major screen transitions.For example, if a user zooms into a particular object on a device's web browser, the transition is done by showing an approximation of what the final display will look like using scaled data from the page before the zoom.Picsel claims it has spent millions of dollars developing the technology for the patent, which the USPTO approved on March 7, 2006.The company also alleges that Apple knowingly and deliberately infringes on patent '626 with devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, although the initial complaint doesn't provide evidence for this claim.Picsel says the IP has been baked into more than 200 million devices worldwide. Its website lists companies like Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, Panasonic, Palm, HP, Motorola, and Nokia as licensing partners.It appears many of the technologies the firm makes are produced in-house - not collected from other inventors.The complaint asks for a block on allegedly infringing Apple products, unspecified damages, that patent damages be increased to three times the amount awarded, and attorneys fees.A copy of the lawsuit is available here. ®

Several versions of Apple's iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have potentially serious security problems, a German government agency said in an official warning Wednesday.Apple's iOS operating system has "two critical weak points for which no patch exists," the Federal Office for Information Security said.Opening a manipulated website or a PDF file could allow criminals to spy on passwords, planners, photos, text messages, e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations, the agency said in a statement."This allows potential attackers access to the complete system, including administrator rights," it added, urging users not to open PDF files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until Apple Inc. publishes a software update.A spokesman for Apple in Germany, Georg Albrecht, told The Associated Press that the company is looking into the matter."We know these reports and are investigating them," he said, refusing to elaborate.Although no attacks have been observed yet they were likely to appear soon, the German agency said."It has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks," it said, noting that the devices' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world.The warning relates to iPhones using iOS versions 3.1.2-4.0.1., iPads using iOS 3.2-3.2.1 and iPods Touch using iOS 3.1.2.-4.0.The agency said it was possible but not clear whether older iOS or iPhone OS versions could also be affected.The federal agency, based in Bonn, said it was in contact with Apple on the issue.

So I have my Macbook (2008, white, running 10.5.8) set to lock when the lid is shut, prompting me for a password when the computer opens/wakes up. Great. No problem. But occasionally I'll plug my iPhone (3G) into the USB port while the lid is shut to charge overnight. When the phone is plugged in, the computer immediately wakes up - the apple logo glows and the phone begins charging. After a few moments, the light turns off, the comp falls back asleep, and the phone continues charging.Risk I noticed (and repeated to test) this morning.Can any of you test this to see if this is more widespread than a fluke in Austin, TX?

I updated my iPhone 4S earlier today (using the OTA method), and I discovered a nasty bug. My iPhone could no longer remember the names of any of my contacts! I opened up the contacts app on my phone and discovered that all of entries were still there but if I got a text or a call my iPhone would have a sudden bout of amnesia and forget the contacts name.It’s even more bizarre when you’re trying to create a new text. In the example above I texted Erin Hontz. After I selected her as the contact, I wrote my message and hit send. In the message pane (pictured on the right) it would forget my contact’s name and just show the number.I mentioned this on Twitter and many of my followers had similar experiences.• Use the Delta Update (The OTA version) • Be on an iPhone 4S (I haven’t had reports with the 4) • Be On VerizonDisabling (and re-enabling) iCloud contacts did not solve the issue.Have you had any issues upgrading to iOS 5.0.1?This method fixed my incoming calls but not incoming text messages. Your milage may vary. via TSF reader James Foster1) Open the Phone and dial *228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number. 2) When the system answer press 1 for “Program or activate your phone” 3) Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, “Settings updated.” 4) Open the Task Manager (double click the home button) and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications 5) Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe) 6) Open the Message App to verify the fix.If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.

Let’s step into a time machine and travel through the mists of chronos to an ancient yesteryear. It was a different era, Britney Spears shaved her head, Boris Yeltsin died, and people learned how to print images on toast from the comfort of their own workshops. Oh, and a lil’ thing called an iPhone came out. The year was 2007, and Verizon and Sprint were so scared that they issued these ridiculous sheets to their frontline reps with talking points for discouraging people from buying an iPhone:“Touch screen: It sounds cool, but if you’re a heavy text or email user, it could be challenging not being able to feel the keys as you press them. And how are you going to type without looking with a keyboard you can’t even feel.” “Sorry, iPhone can’t send picture or video message — only e-mail. No over-the-air downloads. You have to connect to a PC to load music.” “Wi-Fi is not a mobile technology. You have to be in a fixed location to use it — and that’s if you know where to find it. And some Wi-Fi hotspots make you pay to use them. There’re also those pesky concerns about security of Wi-Fi.”“The iPhone is an Apple product and has some nice features. It also has a nice price. Do you really need all those features in one device?” “Are you sure 4G or 8G is enough storage for you? To give you a comparison, most iPods/MP3 players hold 40 to 60Gigs or more.” “Using the iPhone on the GSM/EDGE network may be like having a really powerful computer on dial up.”Ok, that last one turned out to be true.

In an effort to get around Apple's ban on rival browsers for its iPhone, Mozilla plans to offer a Firefox application that will give users access to their browser bookmarks and history. The app will also let users open tabs from their most recent Firefox sessions.The Firefox Home app is a spin-off of the bookmark and tab synchronization technology Mozilla currently offers as an add-on for the Firefox desktop browser. Mozilla will submit the free application to the App Store within the next three weeks. Sadly, Mozilla has no way to know when or if the app will be approved and available to users, so it's hard to say when we'll be able to get our hands on this app.Firefox Home Coming Soon to the iPhoneWe have been working on an application for the iPhone based on the Firefox Sync (formerly Weave Sync) technology. The app is called Firefox Home, and it gives iPhone users instant access to their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks and the set of tabs from their most recent browser session. What’s more, it provides Firefox “Awesome Bar” capability that enables people to get to their favorite web sites with minimal typing.Firefox Home provides an amazing “get up and go” experience. It’s encrypted end-to-end. It’s your home on the Web, wherever you are. And, of course, it’s free.Firefox Home for iPhone is part of a broader Mozilla effort to provide a more personal Web experience with more user control. For devices or platforms where we’re unable to provide the “full” Firefox browser (either technically or due to policy), we aim to provide users with “on the go” instant access to their personal Firefox history, bookmarks and open tabs on their iPhones, giving them another reason to keep loving Firefox on their desktops.Why is this useful?

Apple could be just days away from becoming the subject of an unpleasant antitrust inquiry into a recent decision to restrict software development on the iPhone and iPad. Nevermind Apple’s moral policing which always ignites the heated debate among our readers, this is a much more serious issue than app rejections, the one with potentially far-reaching implications for the Californian firm.From Apple’s perspective, they are entitled to define user experience on the iPhone platform which is – mind you – neither open-sourced nor open in the Android sense. Apple’s unmatched ability to create gadgets that “just work” stems from their tight control of the entire widget, including software, hardware, apps, services, and user interfaces. Take this control away from Apple and you have just another gadget vendor that builds dull products.The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is thinking different about such a closed ecosystem. According to New York Post, Apple could be “in the eye of regulatory storm” and might even face an antitrust probe over its lock out on iPad and iPhone. A source “familiar with the matter” told the publication that:The inquiry could pave the way for a fully-fledged investigation if the agencies conclude that Apple’s controversial decision to prohibit app development does in fact stifle competition. According to Steve Jobs’ widely publicized rambling titled “Thoughts on Flash,” Apple sees third party cross-development tools as a big no-no because they lead to “sub-standard apps and hinder the enhancement and progress” of the platform. It’s a fight for developers’ resources because programmers must choose between “developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously,” New York Post noted.Developers with limited budgets are hurt the most because their focus on iPhone inevitably comes at the expense of other platforms. Jobs has a point, too, because cross-development tools do enable only the lowest common denominator set of features, as he summed it up nicely:If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers. This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor’s platforms.Apple’s our-way-or-the-highway approach makes sense from their way of doing things.  By the way, Adobe’s shares dipped two percent the day Apple published that piece. We’ll find out soon if the DoJ and FTC can establish the case against Apple, but we can help but wonder who’s next?Probe Microsoft because Windows doesn’t run Linux apps? Go after Sony because it only sells Sony Pictures movies on Playstation Network? Bring movie studios to justice because we aren’t allowed to watch FairPlay-DRM’d iTunes movies on non-Apple devices? Hit Adobe because its Flash is killing the prospect of open videos? Meet us in comments.Read more at New York Post

Apple on Monday rested its case that Samsung ripped off the design of the iPhone and iPad while building its own mobile products. Meanwhile, three of the Samsung phones that Apple labeled as infringing were tossed from the trial.It was a minor victory for Samsung. The Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S i9000, and Galaxy S II i9100 were thrown out of the case by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh after questions about whether the phones were even sold in the US. The devices were dropped from the case because they are “world phones that could be purchased in the US., but that weren't sold by Samsung's telecommunications and electronics divisions in the US,” according to CNET.All Things D points out, however, that the ruling does not affect the US-specific versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S and Galaxy SII phones, which are among roughly 20 devices Apple has identified as infringing its intellectual property. Moreover, the three phones were essentially worthless in Apple's case from a financial perspective. Apple's damages report assigned the three phones a worth of $0, the only phones in the case with such a distinction.Samsung tried to get a larger victory today, asking for a Judgment as a Matter of Law that Apple hasn’t proven its case, and that no reasonable jury could possibly side with Apple. Koh rejected Samsung’s request, meaning the case will, as expected, move forward to the next phase. Earlier on Monday, Apple’s expert witness on financial matters testified regarding the damages Apple is seeking, a number that recently grew from $2.5 billion to $2.88 billion.With Apple resting its case, Samsung was able to start its defense late this afternoon. Samsung's first witness was Benjamin Bederson, chief scientist and co-founder of a mobile company called Zumobi. Bederson is testifying on Samsung's behalf because he helped create a user interface for mobile touchscreen devices called LaunchTile, which was apparently used in conjunction with Microsoft's Pocket PC software and the HP iPAQ device starting in November 2004. Samsung believes LaunchTile should count as prior art, making some of Apple's patents invalid because the technology already existed, according to a Forbes liveblog of the trial. After Bederson, one of the people behind a 2001 touchscreen tabletop computer called DiamondTouch also testified on the prior art issue.We’ll hear much more about why Samsung doesn't think it infringed Apple’s patents as the week goes on. Judge Koh is reportedly aiming to move to closing arguments by Tuesday of next week before handing the case off to the jury.

Although previous versions of Windows Mobile have long supported a clipboard to move content around, the Windows Phone 7 Series devices due out this year won't have that ability.LAS VEGAS--The new Windows Phones have a lot of things that prior versions of Windows Mobile haven't had, most notably a cool factor.But one thing that the 7 Series devices won't have--at least not this year's crop--is the ability to broadly copy and paste items. As earlier noted by Engadget, Microsoft confirmed on Tuesday that developers shouldn't expect to have access to a clipboard to allow users to copy and paste. Nor will Microsoft's own Office applications have copy and paste. That's despite the fact that it has been a staple of past versions of Windows Mobile for as long as I can recall."We don't enable copy and paste and we do that very intentionally," Windows Phone executive Todd Brix said in an interview.Brix said many times when a user copies something on a phone, what they really are looking to do is take a specific action, such as calling a phone number or e-mailing an address. For those specific tasks, Microsoft has what it calls "smart linking," which lets a user double click on a phone number and either call it or add it to the phone book. For an address, one can get a map without having to copy and paste the address."It's actually an intentional design decision," he said. "We try to anticipate what the user wants so copy and paste isn't necessary."But, particularly for a device that is going to include Word and other mobile Office applications, the concept of intelligent links doesn't seem sufficient. The BlackBerry for example, offers both intelligent links and a copy-and-paste system, which seems to me to be ideal.Brix insists that most users won't miss copy and paste and said that it was a matter of focus; Microsoft said it wanted to really do well the tasks that 80 percent of users wanted."We tried to focus on what the core use cases were," Brix said. "Certainly there will be some people that wont be happy with some of those decisions."If this feels like deja vu, a similar limitation hampered the initial iPhone, with Apple later going back and adding the feature.As my colleague Jessica Dolcourt noted recently, it's not like users don't want copy and paste. We just take it for granted unless some one boldy chooses to omit it.With the 7 Series taking so many cues from the iPhone, I'm surprised Microsoft didn't learn that lesson.

We knew this day would eventually come, but somehow we're still misting up a little -- Linux has been ported to the iPhone and iPod touch. Dev Team member planetbeing is the mastermind in charge of bringing everyone's favorite open-source OS to Apple's handhelds, and while it's a little rough around the edges (read: no touchscreen drivers, sound, or WiFi / cell radio support), it's definitely the first step on the road to hacking nirvana. The team is hard at work, and it even sounds like they're thinking about porting Android in the near future (!), so hit the read link to try it out and lend a hand if you can -- or just head on past the break for a quick vid of the port in all its text-scrolling glory.[Via iphone-dev.org ; thanks to everyone who sent this in]

Ever wanted to unlock your iPhone simply by having it look at you and recognize who you are? A jailbreak mod called RecognizeMe will be hitting Cydia soon and promises to bring biometric facial recognition security to the iPhone 4. The mod will allow you to unlock your iPhone by scanning your facial features with the front-facing camera and verifying who you are before giving you access.The tweak offers settings for dialing up the level of security (facial matching), which we're assuming requires a bit more processing time, but the app definitely appears to deliver on its promise of facial recognition security for the iPhone 4. The mod looks a little slow at the moment, but hopefully the developers are able to optimize the code before an official release.Check out the video after the jump, and let us know what you think in the comments!

XBMC is a free media player that began life on the Xbox but has since grown to be a multi-platform solution. The XBMC software, which already runs on the previous Mac OS X-based, Intel x86 Apple TV, has now been released to work on the ARM Architecture A4 chip used in the new iOS version, offering the ability to install apps and play content formats Apple doesn't natively support on its $99 box, according to AppleInsider. Furthermore it will be able to be played on the iPad and iPhone.With regard to jailbreaking and Apple TV, MacRumors.com says:The software is not available through the App Store, and requires a jailbroken Apple TV or iOS device. While jailbreaking has been a known way to load third party apps onto the iPad and iPhone, it's not been a very common procedure for the Apple TV. Due to similarities of the underlying iOS firmware on the new Apple TV, it's been widely expected that these unauthorized apps would become available for the device. Apple presently offers no authorized way to install apps on the Apple TV.

Nokia's Lumia 920 packs the industry's best image stabilization -- there's no questioning that -- thanks to a camera module that pairs both sensor and lens-based optical IS. The iPhone 5 also offers a notable improvement over its Apple-made predecessor on the video front, but considering that its stabilization is of the digital variety, we wouldn't expect it to top Nokia's new flagship. We had an opportunity to test both smartphones in a head-to-head demo at Nokia's research and development facility in Tampere, Finland, about two hours north of the company's Espoo headquarters. In fact, we're told that this is the very first such comparison shoot in the world, considering that the iPhone made it to market just last week and the only opportunity to shoot with a Lumia 920 is currently in the European country where the device was born.As expected, the Nokia phone was able to capture far smoother video than what we snapped with the iPhone, with both devices secured side-by-side in a homemade foam holster. Unlike our handheld interview shoot earlier today, we pushed the limits a bit further this time, running through Nokia's parking lot and turning every which way as well. It's important to note that the Lumia 920 we used was a prototype, but its performance was still quite solid. You'll find the side-by-side video just past the break -- the Lumia 920 is on the left, with the iPhone clip on the right.Update: We also had an opportunity to test the Samsung Galaxy S III (just below) and the HTC One X (following) against the Lumia 920. Both smartphones lack OIS, so we weren't surprised to see poor stabilization performance. Check out the videos for the head-to-head.

Free image-browsing app is intended to show what is possible on the mobile platform, but where is the Windows Mobile version?Is it possible some at Microsoft find the iPhone a more attractive platform than the software giant's own Windows Mobile?Engineers in the company's Live Labs have released the company's first application for Apple's popular smartphone--even before making it available on Microsoft's own mobile platform. Seadragon Mobile, which was added to Apple's App Store on Saturday, is a free image-browsing app that allows users to quickly "deep zoom" images while online and is intended to demonstrate what is possible with a mobile platform.Seadragon is the backbone for Microsoft's Photosynth, which allows users to take a grouping of photographs and stitch them together into a faux 3D environment.Other iPhone apps are reportedly in development in Redmond; Microsoft's Tellme unit was expected to release the company's first iPhone app in the form of a voice-activated search for a variety of phones, including iPhone and BlackBerry. A Microsoft representative told my colleague Ina Fried in September that a public version of that program would likely be released in a few months.So where's the Windows Mobile version of Seadragon?"The iPhone is the most widely distributed phone with a (graphics processing unit)," Alex Daley, group product manager for Microsoft Live Labs, told TechFlash. "Most phones out today don't have accelerated graphics in them. The iPhone does and so it enabled us to do something that has been previously difficult to do."

Alright folks, this is the single biggest news in iPhone hacking ever since the jailbreak. iPhone hacker and Dev-Team member Planetbeing apparently just managed to port Google’s Android Mobile OS to the iPhone.I repeat, he took the Android OS, the system that runs on the Android phones, and installed it on an iPhone. I believe this is the very first time someone managed to install a non-Apple OS on the iPhone and the implications of this are absolutely huge.It’s still in alpha version for now, but with some improvements, this would allow anybody to use both iPhone and Android OS on their iPhone. Just like you can do Bootcamp on your Mac to access PC apps, you’ll be able to go on Android to try all these apps that don’t exist, or were not allowed on the iPhone. Imagine for a second that Adobe manages to puts flash on there, well, you’ll get to have it too.Check it out, it’s just sick:To get more late breaking news as it happens, download the AppAdvice iPhone/iPad app!

Porissa sattui maanantaina aamulla jotain varsin kummallista matkapuhelimen kanssa. Nuori mies sai epämukavan kuuman herätyksen maanantaihin. - Aamusta heräilin ja piti mennä yhdeksäksi töihin, mutta meninkin kahdeksaksi isäni kyydillä, aloittaa Helminen. Perillä työpaikan pihalla nuori mies laittoi autossa iPhonen takataskuunsa ja nousi autosta ulos maanantaisesta aamuherätyksestä vielä hieman väsyneenä. Pian kuitenkin takataskussa alkoi tapahtua kummia. - Kävelin autosta ulos kaksi metriä, kun alkoi kuulua outoa suhinaa. Kohta paikat kuumenivat. - Ihmettelin sitä suhinaa ja yhtäkkiä rupesi polttamaan. Katsoin taaksepäin ja savua tuli aivan järkyttävästi. En yhtään osannut ajatella, että se olisi puhelin! Lopulta nuori mies nappaa kännykän takataskusta ja heittää maahan. - Puhelin oli ihan liekeissä ja savusi oikein kunnolla. Housutkin olivat vähän liekeissä. Kyllä siinä kädet tärisivät! Pian isä Juho Helminenkin huomasi, että jotain kummaa tapahtui. Koko tapahtumaketjun tallensi firman valvontakamera. - Siinä se ihan selkeästi näkyy, että poika kävelee autosta vähän maanantaiaamun tyyliin, ja yhtäkkiä savua tulee aivan kamalasti, isä sanoo. - Housuihin paloi kiinni sulaa muovia ja kännykkä paloi huonoon kuntoon, poika kertoo. - Jos olisin mennyt yhdeksäksi, kuten aluksi pitikin, niin kännykkähän olisi syttynyt kotona. Siinä olisi sänky syttynyt palamaan ja olisi voinut käydä pahemminkin. Pidän puhelinta aina sängyssä ja olen tässä miettinyt, mitä kaikkea olisi voinut tapahtua. Isä on ollut yhteydessä Appleen. - Ensin yhdistettiin Yhdysvaltoihin, sitten Ruotsiin ja sitten jollekin suomea puhuvalle, katsotaan nyt miten tämä tästä. Nuori on nyt ilman puhelinta ja uusi pitäisi hankkia. iPhone ei ole joutunut mustalle listalle. - Tässä on nyt selvittelyä, että mitä Apple ja vakuutus tähän sanoo. Eiköjän tässä nyt kuitenkin ole jonkinlaisesta yksittäistapauksesta kyse, poika sanoo. iPhone on ostettu maaliskuun 22. päivä ja se toimi ennen tätä moitteettomasti.

The new iPhone 3G and the iPhone 2.0 software update can best be described as the most successful failure I can remember. Apple has sold an astounding number of phones and applications, and yet is failing in so many different ways:And yet, Apple can chalk this release up as yet another major success. I love my iPhone and other Apple products, but so far my expectations are not being met with the iPhone 2.0 software and the 3G iPhone experience.

Samsung (005930) isn’t even waiting for Apple (AAPL) to launch the iPhone 5 before taking aim at the new smartphone in a new run of attack ads. The first such advertisement appeared in newspapers on Sunday, comparing a sampling of iPhone 5 specs to a significantly larger list of Galaxy S III features. Under the heading “It doesn’t take a genius,” Samsung’s aim is to communicate that its flagship Android smartphone outclasses the iPhone 5 in a number of key areas including display size and quality, RAM, available storage and battery life. Apple’s iPhone 5 launches this coming Friday at 8:00 a.m. local time and the Samsung Galaxy S III went on sale in the U.S. in early July. Samsung’s full ad can be seen below.

The launch of Apple’s latest smartphone has come and gone, sending millions of users home with the latest in mobile tech from Apple. Everything about the iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, and smaller, right down to the SIM card.For the second time since the original iPhone, Apple has opted for a smaller SIM to go in their phone. Micro-SIM cards are now the standard for many carriers, just in time for Apple to adopt the smaller nano-SIM for their devices. This means that every iPhone 5 user, even the ones that are moving from the iPhone 4S, need to move to a new SIM card and throw their old ones away. On an individual scale this is no big deal, but what does such a small change mean on a global scale?Within the first day of pre-orders, Apple had sold more than two million iPhone 5 handsets. This doesn’t include any of the hordes of people that waited outside of an Apple Store on the release day for the phone (which took that figure up to 5 million). This launch was the biggest one Apple has ever had, and the largest pre-order event any smartphone has ever had. More than five million people, most of whom already had a smartphone, now need a new SIM card.Despite the nano-SIM being much smaller than previous cards, the plastic tray that every user is given is the exact same size. This credit card sized piece of plastic has a small rectangle notched out where you punch through and pop out your nano-SIM. The previous SIM and the plastic holder for the new SIM are then tossed in the garbage.The previous SIM and the casing to the new SIM together will weigh about 5.6 grams. If you look at the five million users that managed to secure an iPhone 5 already, that is roughly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated just by forcing every user to replace their SIM card. Nearly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated in a single weekend, and the knowledge that if any of those users move away from the iPhone 5 to another device any time soon, that user will need to change SIM cards all over again.Apple maintains a page on their own website that describes all of the environmental practices, including the things they have done to improve their packaging and manufacturing process along the way. That page has not yet been updated to the iPhone 5, and so does not include any information on what Apple feels the footprint of their latest smartphone is.If you are someone who has just picked up the iPhone 5 and changed SIM, please recyle the plastic.

An Apple logo is seen at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California June 11, 2012.The ruling came from Judge Richard Posner in Chicago federal court. He dismissed the litigation between Apple and Motorola Mobility with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled.The ruling is a blow for Apple, which had hoped a decisive ruling against Motorola would help it gain an upper hand in the smartphone market against Android."Apple is complaining that Motorola's phones as a whole ripped off the iPhone as a whole," Posner wrote. "But Motorola's desire to sell products that compete with the iPhone is a separate harm -— and a perfectly legal one -— from any harm caused by patent infringement."Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment on the ruling. Motorola Mobility spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said the company was pleased that Posner dismissed Apple's case.Both parties have the option to appeal Posner's ruling.Motorola sued Apple in October 2010, a move that was widely seen as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent Apple lawsuit. Apple filed its own claims against Motorola the same month.Posner issued a series of pre-trial rulings that eliminated nearly all of Motorola's patent claims against Apple from the prospective trial, while maintaining more of Apple's claims against Motorola. That meant Apple had more to gain in the trial, which had been set to start last week.However, Posner canceled the trial earlier this month.Apple had sought an injunction barring the sale of Motorola products using Apple's patented technology. But in Friday's ruling, Posner wrote that neither party is entitled to an injunction.Since Motorola could design around the minor technological features covered by Apple's patents, an injunction would be an inappropriate windfall for Apple, Posner wrote.Posner also said that Apple had not clearly demonstrated that Motorola phones caused a loss of consumer goodwill significant enough for an injunction."To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture," Posner wrote.In a bright spot for the iPhone maker, Posner also ruled that Motorola could not seek an injunction based on the one patent in the case that it was still asserting against Apple.Motorola had pledged to license that patent - which covers an aspect of wireless communication - on fair and reasonable terms to other companies in exchange for having the technology adopted as an industry standard."How could it be permitted to enjoin Apple from using an invention that it contends Apple must use if it wants to make a cell phone," Posner wrote.At a hearing earlier this week, Apple had argued that it would be satisfied with an injunction forcing Motorola to remove Apple's patented features within three months. But Posner found that proposal unworkable, in part because of the hardship in administering such an order."Because of the potential costs to Motorola and the federal judiciary I could not responsibly order injunctive relief in favor of Apple," he wrote in his ruling.The case is Apple Inc. and NeXT Software Inc. V. Motorola Inc. and Motorola Mobility Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, no. 11-08540.(Reporting by Dan Levine in Oakland, California and Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and Jeremy Laurence)

The resolution and streaming seems to be top notch, and using Face Time doesn't count as billable minutes. But STILL, somehow, there are some drawbacks.Face Time uses Wi-Fi so you have to be connected to a network in order to use it.Also Face Time only works from one iPhone 4 to another. Users that want video calling with non-iPhone 4 users will be forced to either find other applications or buy all their friends new iPhones.(Negative)BONUS: Even if you COULD get onto this easily and anywhere you want, if you weren't near a charger your conversation probably wouldn't last very long anyway, as apparently the battery on the iPhone 4, even though it's supposedly more powerful by about 40%, really isn't that much better than the one on the 3GS.FaceTime IS great technology, though, and really where phones have been moving towards for the last few years. There's nothing like actually SEEING the people you're speaking for a whole 13 minutes before your battery gives out in the middle of the day.

Google has denied the latest rumors that the search giant will bring free turn-by-turn GPS navigation on the Apple iPhone, although the features could come in the future to other (unspecified) mobile platforms.Reports surfaced on Thursday quoting a Google executive speaking about plans to bring free turn-by-turn navigation to other mobile platforms, including the iPhone, during a London press conference launching Maps Navigation for Android phones in the U.K.."We did not say we would bring it to iPhone, we said to date we've had it on Android and that in the future it may come to other platforms but did not confIn Android 2.0, Google introduced Maps Navigation, which includes 3D maps, turn-by-turn voice guidance, and automatic rerouting -- all at no cost for the user. Available initially only in the U.S., the software does not store the maps on your phone, but uses the Internet connection to display routes.However, Google clarified on Thursday a few unknowns about its free navigation software for Android. Maps Navigation pre-caches an entire route, and it needs a data connection only when it calculates the directions. So, while driving to your destination, if you lose the connection temporarily, the route progress will still be displayed as long as you stay on the initial route.Free turn-by-turn navigation for mobile phones is getting increasingly popular with customers, to the detriment of traditional GPS device makerslike TomTomor Garmin. Next to Google's Maps Navigation, now available in both U.S. and U.K., Nokia introduced in January its own free GPS software for several of its devices, and by now has been downloaded more than 10 million times.

Oh, you knew this was going to happen. Samsung is not taking the release of the iPhone 5 lying down. A new ad declares Apple's phone isn't genius.I don't think they've kissed and made up yet.When one party embarrasses another so badly -- and in public -- you don't expect the hurt one to just take it, do you?And so Samsung is greeting the arrival of the iPhone 5 with an ad that will run tomorrow in certain national and local newspapers (how modern). It is not a flattering ad. It suggests that the iPhone 5 isn't even good enough to be, well, a copy of the Galaxy S3.Clearly, it's been hastily put together, but its headline -- "It doesn't take a genius" -- rather prepares you for what follows.Yes, it's a list of all the fine, rational reasons why the Galaxy S3 is vintage port compared to the iPhone 5's wine-in-a-box.Oh, the Galaxy S3 is full of things the iPhone doesn't have: Palm Swipe Capture, Shake to Update, oh, and NFC -- to name but three.And though there's no doubt that the S3 is a fine phone -- especially for those with hands handed down by gorillas -- there is one small element that Samsung might be overlooking.People don't buy the iPhone for all the features. They buy it for all those quirky, irrational, emotional, maddening reasons that make people's eyes glaze over and their minds work like a blancmange clock.Samsung's biggest problem isn't that its phone doesn't have some fine rational attributes. It's that the brand hasn't captured hearts.There are no lists nor self-help books that can tell you how to do that. That does, sometimes, take a little genius.

Palm wasn’t kidding around when they said they wanted more PDK apps to be submitted. As such, the good folks at Mobile 1UP submitted their entire catalog of mobile games, including the complete GW series, for consideration. And now you too can play their game on your Pre. That, and the Twitter app that beta testers have been raving about has finally arrived - that's right, TweetMe is here, and it’s got some introductory pricing action going to boot. Head on past the break to see it all happen in listacular form.

DALLAS (AP) — An iPhone application helped a Dallas man, while visiting relatives hundreds of miles away in suburban Hartford, Conn., watch as two burglars broke into his home.Vincent Hunter told WFAA-TV that he called 911 at the same time his home security system also contacted authorities.Hunter says "we could see it unfolding."Hunter says an iCam app, which he bought for less than $5, sent him a text message Friday afternoon alerting him that motion detectors sensed movement in his supposedly empty residence.

Samsung has recently been at the courts against Apple in the US. Unfortunately, as we all know, Apple has had one major win against Samsung – resulting in a $1.05 billion fine for the South Korean tech giant.So, when Apple went on to announce (and soon release) the iPhone 5, Samsung wasn’t going to take this lying down. Samsung have made a quite hilarious poster which displays the similarities and differences of the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III.It’s probably worth mentioning too that we don’t know the exact differences between the A6 and Exynos 4 chips found inside – but we do know that the Galaxy S III’s Exynos is quite a powerful chip set. Most of the differences come in the form of design and software additions, but it’s good to see that the iPhone 5 is on-par (or slightly worse off) then a device that was launched 3 months ago. Feast your eyes on this:

iUsers with unmeddled tech must wait for Apple patchThe latest jailbreak for iPhones, published on Wednesday, exploits a zero-day bug in iOS that only users of jailbroken devices will be able to fix, security experts warn.Version 3 of jailbreakme.com, which also works on iPad fondleslabs, takes advantage of a PDF-related vulnerability in iOS. Users of jailbroken devices can use PDF Patcher 2 to guard against the underlying flaw while users of regular devices will have to wait for a patch from Apple. Jailbroken devices allow the installing of apps besides those approved by the official Apple App Store."It's as serious as last time when jailbreakme.com was using a zeroday," notes Mikko Hyponnen of Finnish security firm F-Secure. "Last time nothing bad happened, as Apple patched fast."Apple does not allow anti-virus software to be listed in the official iPhone AppStore, so there's no protection via this route until a patch for the underlying vulnerability is published by Apple.The "temporary" vulnerability of unaltered iPhones and fondleslabs illustrates one security shortfall of the locked-down walled-garden approach practised by Apple. The more laissez-faire approach followed by Google with Android has seen an upswing in malicious code targeted against Droid phones, however. iPhone malware remains even rarer than the low levels of Droid Trojans in circulation but, even so, the potential for badness is still there. ®

Like us on Facebook.com/TrendingNow and follow Trending Now on Twitter: @Knowlesitall and @YahooTrending.Just the other day, we were hearing about Samsung getting in legal trouble over patent violations with Apple. A federal court decision ruled that Samsung owes Apple more than $1 billion in restitution. Samsung plans to appeal the decision, saying it never attempted to steal anything from Apple's iPhone.Next week, on September 12, Apple is expected to introduce its highly anticipated iPhone 5, but the company may find itself on the receiving end of a patent-infringement battle. Chinese tech company Goophone is launching the Goophone I5, which looks suspiciously like an iPhone in the company's video on YouTube.In recent months, tech blogs all over the world have released leaked photos and videos of what is rumored to be Apple's iPhone 5. The pictures show what appears to be a longer, thinner, but altogether similar version of previous models of the best-selling smartphone in the world. The Goophone I5 will run a version of the Android operating system that mimics the look of Apple's IOS. Goophone claims to have already patented its phone in China and vows to sue for patent infringement should Apple try to release the iPhone 5 in China as well.One commenter on Goophone's YouTube account wrote, "the clone wants to sue the original...THIS IS THE FUTURE!" Of course, since the new iPhone 5 does not technically exist for the public yet, we'll just have to wait and see.

Better known for its automobiles, Nissan has shifted gears to the realm of electronics accessories with a new scratchproof iPhone case. More accurately, the cover is susceptible to scratches, but it can automatically "heal" them courtesy of a special paint the Japanese automaker developed in 2005.Dubbed Scratch Shield, the polyrotaxane-based paint has been used on the company's Murano, 370Z, X-Trail and Infiniti vehicles. When gashed, the chemical structure reacts by changing back to its original shape, thus mending the damage. Here's a quick demo from 2008 showing the solution in action:The clip shows a minor abrasion healing over a brief period (the video is only a minute long, but the description sounds as if it's elapsed over half an hour -- impressive regardless). Nissan's press release says Scratch Shield can heal small nicks in as little as an hour, while deeper cuts can take up to a week.Compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, the Scratch Shield case is constructed from ABS plastic and was developed in conjunction with the University of Tokyo and Advanced Softmaterials. In addition to its self-repairing properties, the gel-like paint offers a grippy surface instead of a slick glossy coating.The product currently exists in prototype form and is being tested by select journalists and customers. There's no word on pricing, but if there appears to be enough demand, Nissan will ship the finished product later this year. It's also partnering with other companies interested in using Scratch Shield, such as NTT DoCoMo."We're really excited about the possibilities provided by this technology. In Japan, we've already linked up with world-leading mobile operator NTT DoCoMo to allow them to use the Scratch Shield technology on its Style Series N-03B mobile phones, and we think this technology has real scope beyond the automotive world."
