Apple, never one to tolerate much controversial content in its precious app store, has joined the long list of companies cutting ties with WikiLeaks. An application that offered iPhone users access to WikiLeaks’ daily trickle of formerly-secret diplomatic cables has been removed from the app store with little explanation, as TechCrunch first reported.Igor Barinov, the developer of the app, confirmed to TechCrunch that his $1.99 program had been pulled from the store, though whether that banishment was due to WikiLeaks’ political controversy or some other element of the app still isn’t clear. I’ve contacted the company for comment and will update if I hear back from them.Update: Trudy Muller, an Apple spokesperson, says that Apple  “removed the Wikileaks App from the App Store because it violated our developer guidelines. Apps must comply with all local laws and may not put an individual or targeted group in harms way.”You can still see a cached version of the banned app here.Android, meanwhile, continues to allow half a dozen apps that offer access to WikiLeaks’ content, some for free. I’ve written to Google to ask whether it plans to take any action to block those apps. If it does, it can expect a serious backlash from users who expect a more liberal approach to their content and will no doubt cry foul over any censorship.It’s no surprise that Apple, with its restrictive policies on content, wouldn’t tolerate the hosting of content that the U.S. government has declared stolen goods. Amazon Web Services, a far more tolerant platform, exiled WikiLeaks from its data centers two weeks ago, and financial firms have moved to choke the company too, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and most recently, Bank of America.The ability to scroll on your phone through thousands of raw cables written in stuffy diplomatic language is hardly a privilege most users will miss–after all, they can still access the Guardian and the New York Times apps, where the same information is being parsed and delivered in a much more consumable form. But WikiLeaks will serve as a free speech litmus test for every company in its orbit. And it’s already shown just how little the likes of Apple and Amazon care about users’ access to information.

     SAN FRANCISCO (CN) - AT&T Mobility faces another federal class action involving its iPhone and iPad services. This one claims that "AT&T's bills systematically overstate the amount of data used on each data transaction involving an iPhone or iPad account," and bills customers for data transactions even if they disable their phones and leave them untouched - as the plaintiff's experts did.      The class says AT&T's billing system "is like a rigged gas tank that charges pump that charges for a full gallon when it pumps only nine-tenths of a gallon into your car's tank."     AT&T has faced a welter of class actions since rolling out its iPhone service with Apple, which is not named as a party to this complaint. Previous class actions have claimed AT&T charged for downloads its customers never made, reneged on its billing plans for iPhones, charged for services it could not or did not deliver, and promised but failed that the phones could send text messages and photos.     In the new complaint, named plaintiff Patrick Hendricks claims that AT&T's overbilling "was discovered by an independent consulting firm retained by plaintiff's counsel, which conducted a two-month study of AT&T's billion practices for data usage, and found that AT&T systematically overstate web server traffic by 7 percent to 14 percent, and in some instances by over 300 percent. So, for example, if an iPhone user downloads a 50 KB website, AT&T's bill would typically overstated the traffic as 53.5 KB (a 7 percent overcharge) to as high as 150 KB (a 300 percent overcharge)." (Parentheses in complaint.)     But wait, Hendrick's claim continues: "It gets worse. Not only does AT&T systematically overbill for every data transaction, it also bills for phantom data traffic when there is no actual data usage initiated by the customer. This was discovered by the same independent consulting firm, which purchased an iPhone from an AT&T store, immediately disabled all push notifications and location services, confirmed that no email account was configured on the phone, closed all applications, and let the phone sit untouched for 10 days. During this 10-day period, AT&T billed the test account for 35 data transactions totaling 2,292 KB of usage. This is like the rigged gas pump charging you when you never even pulled your car into the station."     The class claims that though AT&T's overcharges "have a modest effect on an individual customer's bill, they have a huge effect on AT&T's bottom line. AT&T has 92,8 million customers. In the fourth quarter of 2010, AT&T reported its wireless data revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 27.4 percent, from the year-earlier quarter, to $4.9 billion. A significant portion of those data revenues were inflated by AT&T's rigged billing system for data transactions."     Hendricks seeks restitution and class damages for money had and received, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, unfair and fraudulent business practices, unfair competition, and violations of the federal Communications Act. He is represented by L. Timothy Fisher with Bursor & Fisher of Walnut Creek.

Back in my day, piracy and filesharing was sketchy as hell. You would have to dig around on sites that very clearly compromised your security, you had considerably fewer choices in what to download, and cracking software was considerably more difficult. To the point, at least, where someone with less-than average computer skills would not even attempt to crack it, or would get their computer messed up.I remember a time when cracking your gadgets was difficult. Yes you followed instructions from the internet, but there was always a chance it would work and you would break your system. This kept a lot of people from doing it.Now, I have no problem with piracy when it's piracy, but honestly it isn't piracy anymore. It has become sterile and bland. Piracy was named piracy because back in the day, it was like being a pirate! Back then you were a swashbuckling, risk-taking corsair who lived on the edge. It wasn't only getting you the files you want for free, it was god damn exciting. But what has it degraded to? Now everyone has become a pirate. It is the norm. Because everyone is a pirate, pirating has become easier. Have you looked at instructions to "jailbreak" your iphone recently? It's basically one button. And downloading cracked software for that same iphone? I witnessed someone open a professional-looking iphone menu on their cracked phone, and download a brand new game (wich should have costed some money) absolutely free. No hassle, no workarounds, just touch to install. I was disgusted. Piracy should only be accessible to pirates. Your computer illiterate grandmother should not be able to download and crack photoshop. 10 year olds shouldn't be able to jailbreak their iphones and illegally download games people worked hard to make, before they're even old enough to realize what they're doing.Bring piracy back to what it was, something naturally somewhat difficult and slightly risky. Because not everyone should be a pirate. Yar.Edit: Added linebreaks to my "Whining spiel", just for you Paranoir

Eight iPhone owners have joined an elite clan: Their Apple gadget is running a program that cost nearly $1,000.When the iPhone first hit the market in June 2007, those who paid the $499 entry price -- and signed the two-year AT&T contract -- owned a status symbol. A year later, we have the iPhone 3G, Apple's speedier, sleeker and, most important, less expensive smart phone, which introduced a section for downloading third-party applications. Now that the phone is affordable enough for a wider audience, a new status symbol has emerged: a seemingly useless application called I Am Rich.Its function is exactly what the name implies: to alert people that you have money in the bank. I Am Rich was available for purchase from the phone's App Store for, get this, $999.99 -- the highest amount a developer can charge through the digital retailer, said Armin Heinrich, the program's developer. Once downloaded, it doesn't do much -- a red icon sits on the iPhone home screen like any other application, with the subtext "I Am Rich." Once activated, it treats the user to a large, glowing gem (pictured above). That's about it. For a thousand dollars.Apple apparently had some problems with I Am Rich. After initially approving it for distribution, the company has since removed it from the store. Heinrich, a German software developer, has yet to hear back from Apple concerning the removal. "I have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the App Store," Heinrich said in an e-mail with The Times today.But Apple couldn't pull it down before curious aristocrats -- eight of them -- had purchased it. Six people from the United States, one from Germany and one from France dropped a grand for the gem in the first 24 hours it was available, Heinrich said. That's $5,600 in revenue for Heinrich and $2,400 for Apple, which collects 30% of each sale for "store upkeep."In the e-mail, Heinrich said there seemed to be a market for the program. "I am sure a lot more people would like to buy it -- but currently can't do so," Heinrich said. "The App is a work of Art and included a 'secret mantra' -- that's all."A possible explanation for its removal: A screen shot of an App Store review that has been circulating around the Web recently, showing a user's complaint that he purchased it accidentally. "I saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked 'buy' thinking it was a joke, to see what would happen. ... THIS IS NO JOKE...DO NOT BUY THIS APP AND APPLE PLEASE REMOVE THIS FROM THE APP STORE," it read.I Am Rich isn't the first software that has been removed from Apple's store. Box Office, a movie showtime resource, and NetShare, which let users connect a computer to the Internet using the iPhone's 3G wireless data service, disappeared without a trace. Apple did not respond to phone calls for comment.UPDATED: In a follow-up e-mail, Heinrich said he had not yet received his $5,600 check from Apple, which has a policy of paying developers at the end of each calendar month. He's unsure how the app's removal will affect the payment process."I've got e-mails from customers telling me that they really love the app," adding that they had "no trouble spending the money," he said.UPDATED: Heinrich confirms the validity of the review pictured in the screenshot, and Apple has refunded his and another buyer's money. "I don't want to collect money from people who did this by accident and I am glad that Apple returned the money for two orders," Heinrich said.Milian is an intern at latimes.com.

In the wake of Apple's decision to relax restrictions on the tools its developers can use, Adobe announced Friday that it would resume development on Flash for the iPhone.Adobe "will now resume development work" on its Packager for iPhone for future releases, Adobe wrote in a blog post. The feature is part of the Flash Professional CS5 authoring tool.In April, Adobe announced that it would no longer invest in iPhone-based Flash development after Apple banned private APIs and required apps to be written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine."Essentially, this has the effect of restricting applications built with a number of technologies, including Unity, Titanium, MonoTouch, and Flash CS5," Adobe principal product manager Mike Chambers said at the time. "While it appears that Apple may selectively enforce the terms, it is our belief that Apple will enforce those terms as they apply to content created with Flash CS5."On Thursday, however, Apple reversed course and said it would relax all restrictions on the development tools used to create iOS apps, as long as the resulting apps did not download any code."This is great news for developers and we're hearing from our developer community that Packager apps are already being approved for the App Store," Adobe said. "We do want to point out that Apple's restriction on Flash content running in the browser on iOS devices remains in place."Apple and Adobe have not exactly been on the best of terms lately. They got into a very public spat earlier this year when Apple CEO Steve Jobs posted a note on the Apple Web site that said Apple products would not include support for Flash because the technology is closed, unstable, and antiquated. Adobe responded by saying it would focus its attention on Android apps.Adobe reiterated its commitment to other platforms Friday."Adobe will continue to work to bring full web browsing with Flash Player 10.1 as well as standalone applications on AIR to a broad range of devices, working with key industry partners including Google, HTC, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, Palm/HP, RIM, Samsung and others," the company said.

A Pennsylvania man has sued Apple for not doing enough to prevent children from running up huge in-app purchase bills in iPhone, iPad games.Shortly after Apple introduced new parental controls for in-app purchases on iPhone or iPad games, the company is being slapped with a lawsuit that says it hasn't done enough.Earlier this week, Garen Meguerian of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against Apple that says the company's policy for in-app purchases doesn't go far enough to prevent children from buying currency or points inside apps and games. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, requests class-action status and asks for unspecified damages and legal fees.Meguerian brought the suit after his 9-year-old daughter downloaded the free iOS games Zombie Cafe, Treasure Story, and City Story, and then proceeded to buy virtual currency within the games, which ended up costing Meguerian $200, according to the complaint."These games are highly addictive, designed deliberately so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $100 purchase or more," the lawsuit reads.The complaint notes that Apple requires a password in order to purchase anything from the App Store, and also acknowledges that Apple recently added the requirement via an iOS updatethat a password be entered before making purchases inside any app. The suit finds fault with the fact that the password required for both scenarios is the same.The Associated Press wrote last December about parents having to pay massive bills generated by their children buying items within games or apps without a clear understanding that they cost real money.Then the Federal Trade Commission got involved, with Chairman John Leibowitz sending a letter to Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) confirming that he would review the way Apple marketed in-app purchases, in particular apps aimed at children.Apple responded shortly thereafter with new parental controls in the iOS 4.3 update.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.This story was updated on 4/18 to note that the AP first reported on the issue of children spending real money on in-app purchases without parental permission. An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed the first report of it to the Washington Post.

Foxconn's factory in Shenzhen, China, is home to about half of its 420,000 workers. They make many of our gadgets and computers, then walk to dormitories on the 2.1-kilometer-square campus. I got to look inside.I traveled to China to report on Foxconn and Shenzhen as part of a special feature for WIRED, which will be published in an upcoming issue of the magazine. In the meantime, here's a small glimpse of some of the things I saw while in Shenzhen.This dorm is one of the older ones on campus, built near the beginning. It's a men's dorm—women have separate facilities—and populated mostly by entry-level workers.Since a spate of eleven suicides earlier this year, every building on the Foxconn campus is draped in netting. It is morbid but seemingly effective; there have been no suicides since the nets were installed in May.Hallways remain institutionally empty, kept dim to save energy, keep the temperature down, and to allow workers who keep a late schedule to sleep with less interruption during the daylight hours.A dorm room. Eight workers sleep in four bunk beds in a room about the size of a two-car garage.Toiletries kept on a shelf in mugs.A television viewing room is available on each floor. I joked with the Foxconn executive who was with me that of all the places in the world that could probably manage to get bigger television screens installed, it was probably here at Foxconn, who make televisions for the world's largest brands.Workout equipment in the spaces between buildings.In a newer dorm, a sink is shared on the balcony, where workers can wash their clothing and themselves. Management of the living quarters has recently been outsourced to a local operations company in an attempt to address concerns about an employer managing living conditions of its workers. It's unclear how outside management will fundamentally alter the nature of on-campus living.

The overwhelming success of Apple’s iPhone 4S has finally hit a lull. Since its launch last October, the device has managed to hold on to the title of top selling device in the United States for 10 months before finally being dethroned by the Samsung Galaxy S III last month.According to analyst Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity, monthly channel checks have confirmed that the Galaxy S III is the top selling device at T-Mobile (who doesn’t carry the iPhone 4S), Sprint and Verizon. The iPhone remained the number one device at AT&T, but the S III’s success at the other three largest carriers in the nation is enough to secure the number one spot.The S III wasn’t the only Android device to do well, it’s worth noting that the number two top selling device at Verizon was the Droid RAZR MAXX, and every carrier that sells an HTC One series device has it in their top three.Now that the Galaxy S III has become the top selling device in the nation, can it hold on? Apple, Motorola, HTC, LG, Nokia and even Samsung have new devices slated to hit the market before the end of the year. Still, I’d venture to guess the S III is more than capable of keeping up with whatever hits shelves by the holiday season.

Dear iPhone 4 Users, The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in Apple's history. It has been judged by reviewers around the world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them. Here is what we have learned. To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design. At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our own experience and testing. What can explain all of this? We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising. Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display 4 bars when we should be displaying as few as 2 bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place. To fix this, we are adopting AT&T's recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the iPhone's bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a given area. We are also making bars 1, 2 and 3 a bit taller so they will be easier to see. We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been present since the original iPhone, this software update will also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G. We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same- the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused. As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund. We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do. Thank you for your patience and support. Apple

Consumer Reports said Monday it cannot recommend the iPhone 4 after testing confirmed "there is a problem with its reception."The highly regarded publication said its engineers tested three iPhone 4s, and found that complaints by others about the phone's reception are valid. Apple, contacted for comment, has not yet responded."When your finger or hand touches a spot on the phone's lower left side —an easy thing, especially for lefties — the signal can significantly degrade enough to cause you to lose your connection altogether if you're in an area with a weak signal," Consumer Reports said. "Due to this problem, we can't recommend the iPhone 4."There is, the magazine noted, an "affordable solution for suffering iPhone 4 users. Cover the antenna gap with a piece of duct tape or another thick, non-conductive material. It may not be pretty, but it works. We also expect that using a case would remedy the problem. We'll test a few cases this week and report back."Just 10 days ago, Consumer Reports said on its electronics blog that while holding the iPhone 4 "in certain ways does cause signal loss," that's true for "all cell phones.""All phones are subject to interference from the human who is using them," wrote Mike Gikas on the blog. "And even if the alleged signal loss is real, there's an absence of hard evidence that iPhone 4 reception is problematic compared to past iPhones; indeed, there's evidence of just the opposite."However, a note added since then to the blog says "Since posting this report, Mike Gikas has also experienced the 'dropped call' issue which many of our readers have been attesting to in our blog readers' comments section."The iPhone 4 reception and antenna issues began almost immediately after the phone went on sale June 24. The new phone, unlike its predecessors, has the antenna wrapped around the phone's casing, which some have described as a design flaw.Apple, in a previous statement, said that "Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas. This is a fact of life for every wireless phone."The company said that those iPhone 4 users who have the problem should "avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band, or simply use one of many available (phone protector) cases."A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Apple and AT&T, exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the United States, over the iPhone 4's antenna reception.Consumer Reports said that the "signal problem is the reason that we did not cite the iPhone 4 as a 'recommended' model, even though its score in our other tests placed it atop the latest Ratings of smart phones that were released today."The iPhone scored high, in part because it sports the sharpest display and best video camera we've seen on any phone, and even outshines its high-scoring predecessors with improved battery life and such new features as a front-facing camera for video chats and a built-in gyroscope that turns the phone into a super-responsive game controller," the publication said. "But Apple needs to come up with a permanent — and free — fix for the antenna problem before we can recommend the iPhone 4."

At a press conference Monday morning in Manhattan, CEO Jeff Bezos introduced a thinner, lighter and faster version of the company's surprisingly popular handheld electronic book reader. The price is the same -- $359 -- and it goes on sale today for delivery in 15 days.The new device looks very much like the old one, with these improvements:Thinner: 0.36 inches thick, 25% thinner than an iPhoneQuicker: Turns pages 20% fasterLonger lasting: 25% increase in battery lifeBetter display: 16 shades of gray (was 4)Bigger memory: Stores up to 1,500 booksBigger vocabulary: Built-in 250,000 dictionaryBetter navigation: With a 5-way joystickMore vocal: Able to read text aloud in a semi-robotic voiceLess accident prone: The page-turn buttons are smaller and harder to hit by mistakeMore wired: New Whispersync technology (more below)"We want the Kindle to disappear," said Bezos before a packed audience in the basement of Manhattan's Carnegie Library. "It's designed so nothing interferes with that incredibly pleasurable mental flow-state you get into when you are reading a good book."Bestselling thriller author Stephen King read from new a short story -- "Ur" -- that is available, for now, exclusively on the Kindle. "I'm the entertainment," he quipped.The original Kindle allowed users to download books (standard price: $9.99) wirelessly from the Internet using a built-in 3G cellular modem.The Kindle 2 goes one step further. The new Whispersync technology allows users to pause in their reading on, say, a Kindle 1, and pick up where they left off on a Kindle 2 and, eventually, on future wireless devices -- a phrase Bezos left tantalizingly vague. Earlier reports suggested that the company's electronic library of 230,000 books would be available on various cell phones including Google's (GOOG) Android phones and Apple's (AAPL) iPhone.Ian Freed, VP for Kindle, said the company was working "as quickly as possible" to bring Whispersync to a variety of existing smartphones, starting with the ones that offer the best reading experience. He declined to give a timeframe.Amazon has never released Kindle sales figures, nor would its spokespeople confirm analyst estimates that it has sold as many as 500,000 units of the original model. The company had trouble keeping up with demand through much of 2008, especially after Oprah Winfrey endorsed the device on national television, calling it "my new favorite thing in the world."

Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas. This is a fact of life for every wireless phone. If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4, avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band, or simply use one of many available cases.So, we just spoke with Apple and got the straight dirt on the reception issues that have been plaguing users today... and it's a little surprising. In essence, Apple cops to the fact there are reception issues with the new iPhone -- namely, that if you cover the bottom-left corner of the phone and bridge the gap between the notch there with your naked flesh, you could see some signal degradation. Yes, you read that right: it's not a software or production issue, simply a matter of the physical location of your hand in regards to the phone's antenna. The company's suggested fix? Move your hand position, or get a case which covers that part of the phone, thus breaking contact. As you can see in the email above which just arrived in our tip box, this is a sentiment which runs pretty high at the company. Here's the official statement:We know what you're thinking, and we're thinking it too: this sounds crazy. Essentially, Apple is saying that the problem is how you hold your phone, and that the solution is to change that habit, or buy one of their cases. Admittedly, this isn't a problem that exists only for the iPhone 4 -- we've seen reports of the same behavior on previous generations (the 3G and 3GS), and there is a running thread about this problem with the Nexus One. While it is definitely true that interference is an unavoidable problem, we can't help feeling like this is really a bit of bad design. If the only answer is to move your hand, why didn't Apple just move the antenna position? What we can say without question is that in our testing of the phone , we had improved reception and fewer dropped calls than we experienced with the last generation, and we never noticed this issue. Additionally, when using a bumper we can't recreate the signal loss. So, now we have an answer... all we're wondering is whether or not the company will start handing out bumpers pro-bono to those who are experiencing problems. It certainly seems like the right thing to do. To add a little perspective, check out a video from 2008 after the break showing the same issue with the now-ancient iPhone 3G (thanks Inge).

Steve Wozniak has a tradition of being the first in line to buy Apple products, but he usually waits outside one of the Apple stores in California. This year, the Apple co-founder went to a whole new level for the iPhone 5 launch and waited in line at an Apple store in Australia so he could be one of the first in the entire world to get it.[More from Mashable: The iPhone 5 Hits Stores Today and Two Other Stories You Need to Know]Woz tweeted to his followers Friday from the line at an Apple store in Brisbane and wrote in a Blipfoto post that, "I wanted to be among the first in the world to get my iPhone 5's. I beat my California friends by 17 hours."While he was hours ahead of his friends back in the U.S., Woz wasn't actually the first in line in Australia. According to first-hand reports on Twitter, Woz was actually seventh in line. When he did enter the Apple store, people apparently chanted "Woz" over and over.Wozniak later told The Los Angeles Times that he ended up buying two 64 GB iPhone 5s -- one in each color because he didn't know whether to go with the black or the white version.Buying an iPhone 5 wasn't Wozniak's only business in Australia. He also tweeted about seeing Julia Stone in concert at the Cultural Center in Brisbane.

'Apple should have kept ours. But what do I know?'Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureGoogle has not made a maps app for the iPhone 5, its chairman Eric Schmidt said this morning - and his company is not working on one.The search engine supremo's snub will come as a blow to fanbois who "upgraded" to the latest Apple smartphone, or installed the new iOS 6 operating system on their fruity gadgets, and found Google's maps app replaced by Apple's less-than-brilliant satnav-like alternative. Many punters have urged Google to produce a new replacement map app.Schmidt revealed that execs at top tech companies chat among themselves a lot, but that obviously doesn't stop the power play that has seen Google's map service booted out of the iPhone. Apple and Google are locked in a battle for supremacy in the mobile tech arena: the search giant's Android operating system is at the heart of smartphones and tablets competing against Apple's iPhones and iPads."We’ve been talking with [Apple] for a long time. We talk to them every day," he insisted. He was mellow on Apple's decision:We think it would have been better if they had kept ours. But what do I know? What were we going to do, force them not to change their mind? It’s their call.Schmidt's aside to a press pack is the only indication from Google so far about its plans for Google Maps on iOS 6, which also powers the new iPhone 5. There was speculation that Google was on the verge of putting out a replacement app available through iTunes.Schmidt took the opportunity to make a few more points about the iPhone: "Apple is the exception, and the Android system is the common model, which is why our market share is so much higher."Schmidt said that the success of Linux-powered Android smartphones has been overlooked by the media, which he said was "obsessed with Apple's marketing events and Apple's branding"."That's great for Apple, but the numbers are on our side," he said. ®

Last week’s revelation that Apple iPhones and Google Android-based smart phones were retaining locational information generated howls of protest from privacy advocates and government officials. Concerned that mobile devices were tracking our digital footsteps, many wanted “steps to be taken” to address their worries.Some of the concerns raised about the retention of locational data are valid. But panic, prohibition and a “privacy precautionary principle” that would preemptively block technological innovation until government regulators give their blessings are not valid answers to these concerns. The struggle to conceptualize and protect privacy rights should be an evolutionary and experimental process, not one micro-managed at every turn by regulation.Regulation should enter the picture only when companies break the promises they make to consumers or engage in deceptive practices. If serious harm has come to someone because of data disclosure, the Federal Trade Commission already has the power to crack down on companies, or lawsuits and class actions can be pursued.The data collected on Apple phones was brought to light after some computer science geeks unearthed a file buried on iPhones that can only be read on a computer that is syncing with the user’s device. This means the most likely snoop of your data would be someone already known to you. This could be a problem when an abusive spouse is involved, but in most circumstances, this is likely not a serious issue.Government access to locational data, however, is a more significant issue. Governments possess unique powers the private sector lacks, such as taxation, surveillance, fines, and imprisonment. Indeed, the Obama administration is asking the Supreme Court to rule that the police can surreptitiously attach GPS devices to your car and track your movements—without a warrant or oversight of any kind. Meanwhile in Michigan, police are downloading the entire contents of citizens’ smartphones — including geolocation information, emails, texts, and call histories — when stopping them even for routine traffic offenses.People genuinely concerned about privacy should focus their attention on these state-sponsored abuses and how to limit them. Congress should update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 to ensure adequate safeguards against unwarranted snooping by the law enforcement and a subpoena process that places a high bar on government access to phone records.Some critics worry about companies using locational data for advertising or marketing purposes even though that doesn’t happen much today. Even in this case it is unclear where the harm lies. If our phones know we are walking by an ice cream parlor and the store’s owner is offering free scoops to nearby consumers who find the shop with their phones, that seems like a benefit, not a harm.After all, while for some privacy trumps all other considerations, for others locational data provides the services they expect.  For finding the location of an appointment, seeking out a restaurant in a new neighborhood, or networking with a friend, geo-location is a “must-have” feature on digital devices.Optimally, companies should get clear consent before any “tracking” features collect data about user whereabouts. But in practice, consent can be tricky. What data does the user own? What data do those who provide us with innovative (and often free) services own?

SAN FRANCISCO—In a move expected to revolutionize the mobile device industry, Apple launched its fastest and most powerful iPhone to date Tuesday, an innovative new model that can only be seen by the company's hippest and most dedicated customers."I am proud today to introduce to those who really, truly deserve it, our most incredible iPhone yet," announced Apple CEO Steve Jobs, extending his seemingly empty left palm toward the eagerly awaiting crowd. "Not only is this our lightest and slimmest model ever, but as any truly savvy Apple customer can clearly see, it's also the most handsome product we've ever designed."The packed auditorium, which had been listening to Jobs in hushed reverence for several minutes, then erupted into applause, with hundreds of men and women suddenly jumping to their feet and shouting, "I can see it!" "Look, there it is!" and "God, it's so beautiful!"Screams of "Of course, yes, I too can see the phone," were also heard at this time.According to Apple, the new iPhone 3GI boasts significant hardware and software upgrades, superior processing speeds, and a multi-touch interface that provides those who are "cool enough" with a rich user experience. The wide-screen display reportedly also features the most brilliant colors and finest resolution ever imagined."The new 3GI is as light as air," said Apple senior vice president Philip Schiller, reaching inside an empty display case, apparently to remove the mobile device. "See how thin that is? It's like it's not even there.""Those who really understand what we do here at Apple are going to love this new product," Schiller continued. "Unless, you know, they happen to be totally lame."Retailing for $599, the iPhone 3GI offers only the most special Apple consumers—the ones who believe in the company more than anything else in the world, and who would never, ever dream of questioning it—the ability to open dozens of powerful applications at once. In addition, the new multimedia device will provide true Apple fans with a high-definition video camera, one-tap editing with Final Cut Pro, and cut and paste.Like thousands of others, New York resident Kelly Delaney called in sick to work so that she could join the line outside the Apple Store's trendy SoHo location days before the 3GI went on sale."Oh my God, I can't believe how much faster you can get online with this," said Delaney, who exited the store holding a cupped hand up to her ear and yelling into her wrist about how wonderful the new phone was. "The reception is so clear, and you can pretty much get a signal no matter where you go.""Hold on a sec," continued Delaney, suddenly shaking her hand up and down. "I think my battery is dying."According to Apple, the new iPhone launched in 22 countries and sold a record-breaking 8 million units on its first day."The selection of colors is amazing," said Paul Conrad, a Fairfield, VA native who purchased phones in black, white, and silver. "Not only does it look awesome, but it can do pretty much anything you want as long as you believe in it.""The AppleCare Plan doesn't cover dropping your phone, though, so I'd recommend buying one of these designer protective cases," Conrad added.While the new iPhone has been greatly admired and widely touted for its impressive voice and data communication capabilities, some Americans remain skeptical."Daddy isn't talking into anything at all," said 4-year-old Ella Conrad, pointing at her father, Paul, who has been obsessively staring at, playing with, and customizing the invisible phone since purchasing it Monday. "Daddy's pretending to be on hold with an operator."

This is most the obvious and the most packed with irony, given that Apple is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/24/apple-samsung-lawsuit-verdict_n_1829268.html?1345857263&utm_hp_ref=technology" target="_hplink">suing</a> Samsung in every country it can. The new, larger iPhone -- with a 4-inch display vs. the 3.5-inch display on all older models -- is closer in size to the 4.8-inch span on the Galaxy S III's screen. Was Apple's decision to up the iPhone's screen real estate a response to the popularity of Samsung's plus-sized and popular handsets?Google, which makes the operating system the Galaxy smartphones run on, is also embroiled in spat with the iPhone maker. Apple snidely decided to make <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/11/apple-debuts-maps-app_n_1587726.html" target="_hplink">its own map app for iOS 6</a>, which ships on the iPhone 5; Google Maps won't be preloaded onto iOS 6 devices. (Users can still go to the App Store and download it themselves.) Apple touts Maps as being <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/" target="_hplink">smooth and responsive,"</a> implying that Google Maps left something to be desired.So the new iPhone can take panoramic photographs, huh? Where have we seen that before? Oh right: Both HTC and Nokia smartphones. Nokia's new Lumia 920 comes with a camera setting that lets users <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57510802-233/iphone-5-vs-galaxy-s3-vs-lumia-920-by-the-numbers/" target="_hplink">create panorama shots of their surroundings</a>; HTC Windows Phones have come with a similar tool into the camera software "for some time now," <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44983/nokia-creative-studio-for-windows-phone" target="_hplink">according to Pocket-lint</a>. (Image courtesy of Apple.)Another nifty photo-related feature of the iPhone 5 is the ability to seamlessly share pictures with your friends. "The Shared Photo Streams feature is arguably the most practical addition, since previously sharing photos by email limited users to sending 5 photos at a time," <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-panoramic-photos-better-photo-sharing-in-new-iphone/" target="_hplink">explains TechCrunch</a>. "MMS'ing photos is also not ideal." But text and email's limitations haven't stopped iPhone users from sharing photos. Instagram didn't get to 100 million users by being a bad alternative for publishing mobile pics. There are also plenty of photo-sharing app out there, with smaller but devoted user bases than Instagram's.

Anticipation for the launch of the Raspberry Pi $25 PC continues to grow as its launch window gets ever closer. Over the past few months it has been surprising to see what the tiny machine is capable of. Videos of it running Quake III, playing back 1080p video, and handling graphics-intensive particle and sprite demos have all impressed, but until now we haven’t really been able to gauge how the device compares to other gadgets.Eben Upton has an interview going live today with Eurogamer’s Digital Foundry, and it offers up new insight into just how powerful the Raspberry Pi is. You may be surprised to find what it is actually better than in terms of performance.The Raspberry Pi relies on a custom chipset from Broadcom called the BCM2835. Being custom, it has allowed the development team to tweak performance to the point where Eben believes it is the best mobile GPU available. That’s easy to say when you’ve worked on the chip, so he’s given some examples to show how well it performs. The GPU apparently doubles the performance currently found in the iPhone 4S. It is also expected to easily outperform Nvidia’s Tegra 2.If you consider what an iPhone 4S is capable of, and all those devices running graphically intensive apps on the Tegra 2 platform, you can see the potential impact the Raspberry Pi could have.The reason the Raspberry Pi exists is to get cheap computers into the hands of kids and available in every classroom. Get the younger generations programming and experimenting and you have an army of budding software and hardware engineers ready to build the next Google or Apple in years to come. But the computing power on offer in such a cheap package means Raspberry Pi could impact more than just kids and schools. The hardware is more than capable of being a HTPC, it could replace more expensive home PCs, and I’ve already suggested the $100 PC is now viable.To classify the Raspberry Pi as a cheap PC for kids is to sell it very short. Just like Arduino opened up electronics to everyone, the $25 PC could become the heart of many a new product as well as redefining what we class as an affordable home computer.

Sprint's policy is to have the iPhone 4S SIM locked to our network domestically and internationally. At launch, the International SIM will be unlocked. We do expect a SIM lock to be pushed to the devices shortly after launch. We will then allow existing customers in good standing to unlock the SIM for international use if needed in the future. Customers can sign up for one of our international rate plans and use this phone all over the world. When traveling internationally, there is a setting that must be turned on within the device to connect to GSM. The phone will work with a SIM that is provided within the device out of the box. International voice and data charges are on a pay-as-you-go basis and vary based on the country where the customer is using their phone; a list of rates is available at www.sprint.com/international. Sprint offers two international voice plans that customers can subscribe to for discounted voice rates: * The Canada Roaming add-on is $2.99 per month and all calls placed from Canada are only 20 cents per minute. Without this add-on, calls from Canada are 59 cents per minute. * The Sprint Worldwide Voice add-on is $4.99 per month and offers discounted rates in countries around the world. For example, calls from Italy are $1.69 per minute with this add-on or $1.99 per minute without the add-on; calls from Peru are $2.29 per minute with the add-on or $2.49 per minute without it. Sprint does supply notifications of data roaming charges to protect customers from high costs. Notifications are sent to the customer's preferred method, either text or email, and are sent once the device exceeds approximately $50, $250, $500 and $1,000. To protect the customer from additional charges, the device's international data roaming capability will be suspended after the customer exceeds approximately $1,000 of international data charges in a billing cycle.

So for those who haven't been following along, Giz got their hands on the new iPhone, they make a post that garnishes them 4 million page views in a day. Cool. The phone belonged to a poor schmuck who got drunk and left it on a stool. Whatever.But then Giz decides to post the kid who lost the phone's personal info, Facebook page and Flickr, all alongside a picture of the dude holding a WHISKEY bottle. Basically portraying him as an alcoholic dumbass, while simultaneously painting a picture of Giz being totally innocent, along with the dude who "found" the phone sitting on the stool. That post here. Why do this? Why piss on this guys corpse? What exactly did they gain from basically placing a Dunce cap on his head for the rest of his career?I state that this is a douche move in a comment, and get greeted with this... HAHAHAHA... What kind of horse shit is this? I understand that it's their site... But what is up with these dudes? I haven't been following them long enough to know if they are just naturally assholes, or if this is newfound confidence in the wake of buying a stolen iPhone.EDIT: masklin posted this, its Craig Hockenberry's attempt to get some kind of apology from Giz for basically blackballing this kid.

Dan Wooley survived under the rubble of a hotel in Haiti after the earthquake by consulting a medical iPhone app to treat his wounds. " />Dan Wooley survived under the rubble of a hotel in Haiti after the earthquake by consulting a medical iPhone app to treat his wounds.The Best Reason to Have an iPhone YetUsually, when someone says their iPhone is a life saver, they are talking about the phone helping them find a good takeout spot or an emergency bathroom.When Dan Woolley says it, he really means it. He used a medical app saved on his phone to treat a leg injury after the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince collapsed around him.Woolley, who is from Colorado Springs, is one of the Americans who survived the massive earthquake that hit Haiti last week, and he did it with an iPhone application. Woolley is now recovering at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, but it was his fast actions with the app that may have saved his life.Woolley used the light from his iPhone to show him his injuries and diagnosed it properly as a broken foot. Then, he used the instructions from the app to treat the excessive bleeding from cuts on his legs and the back of his head.Woolley used his shirt to tie off the three-inch gash that was opened on his leg and a sock to bandage the back of his head. He said he also looked up ways to stop from going into shock."I kind of had some time to do some self-diagnosis down there," Woolley said. "God was with me."Not bad for a film producer who was in Haiti filming a documentary on efforts to help the nation's poverty-stricken children.Woolley also used his camera to take pictures of the surrounding rubble to piece together a way out. He eventually took refuge in an elevator shaft until rescue crews found him 65 hours after the earthquake."I took pictures all around me, then I would hold up the back of the camera to me and I could see what the picture was of a little," he said. "I was able to find an elevator in one of the pictures and that is where I decided to hobble to be in a more safe location."On Tuesday, Woolley told The Today Show he knew he was going to die and decided to write a journal on his notepad to his wife and young kids in the event someone found his corpse under the rubble."I was in a big accident. Don't be upset at God. He always provides for his children even in hard times," Woolley wrote in the dim light. "I'm still praying that God will get me out but he may not but He will always take care of ya."

I bought a Samsung Omnia 7 phone. The deciding reason for me was the price as the phone had lost more than 40% from the original price (at online stores). I checked it out at a normal store and was impressed. Really liked how it looked and felt, so I bought it. That was 3 weeks ago... since then I've been under attack. People directly laughing at me, mocking me for being totally lost in the tech world, telling me what a huge mistake I have made and that I should give it back. EVERYBODY is explaining what a shitty product it is... forget the iPhone owners, even dumb phone users are schooling me... I feel like I work for Microsoft everytime I try to suggest that I actually like the thing and that it works fine for me, especially as I paid 50% less than what I had originally planned on spending on a smart phone.I can't believe this shit. What the fuck is wrong with people these days? Can someone remind me, why everybody hates Microsoft so much?! I've never felt any warm feeling for MS but they never really did anything wrong to me.

AT&T has issued a press release today announcing that MMS will become active for iPhone users on September 25.We've been working for the past several months to prepare our systems and network to ensure the best possible experience with MMS when it launches - and that launch date is: September 25 for iPhone 3G and 3GS customers. MMS will be enabled through a software update on that day.AT&T points to the need for the company to build out its network infrastructure to handle the demands of heavy MMS messaging volumes as the primary reason for the delay in launching the service compared to carriers in other countries that have offered MMS since the launch of iPhone OS 3.0 in June. As announced in June, MMS messaging will be included at no additional cost to users with an iPhone text messaging plan. There has been much speculation on the availability of MMS from AT&T, some with dubious origins . Next week's Apple media event had been the subject of some speculation as a possible venue for AT&T to launch MMS, which was first promised at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June, though today's news has put all such rumors to bed.

Fruity peddler of broken iPhones, Apple is leaning on a kid for doing what it can't manage – making a white iPhone 4.Apple has been putting off making a white iPhone 4 until next March because it claims that it is pretty tricky. This has apparently opened the market for those who think it is a doddle.It is such an easy task that Fei "Phil" Lam, 17, from New York, has been cashing in by flogging a converter kit that turns black iPhone 4s into white ones.Apple's response has been to send the boys around. According to the Sydney Morning Herald Lam claims that Jobs' Mob had sent around a private dick to try and gag him from selling the kits. He also claims he had Apple shut down his eBay listings too.So far he has made about $30,000 to $40,000 from the kits which cost up to $279 each.What is doubly embarrassing for Apple is that the kits use parts supplied by the suicide plagued Foxconn, which makes the iPhone in China. The question is then, if Lam can make a White iPhone using kit from Apple's own supplier, why can't Apple?The answer might be in the price tag. Lam said it costs him a lot to bring the components for the kits into the country and he does not have a high mark up. It might be that it is too expensive for Jobs' Mob to get its traditional high mark-up for a white case.It might be that Apple does not have to take too much action against Lam – after he has made a bit of dosh he plans to go to college.   Lam says he is an Apple fanboy, but admits he does not own an iPhone.  Apparently, despite all the cash he has made he does not think he can afford one.  This is how someone ends up being a billionaire before they are 20.

A day after converting the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full-fledged release, Skype pushes out updates to its Windows software and its iPhone app.Updated on July 2, 2009, at 9:02 a.m. PT with more from Skype regarding push notification for the iPhone/iPod Touch app.Skype is certainly on a roll this week. Just yesterday it converted the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full-fledged release. On Tuesday, the VoIP company did it again for Skype 4.1 for Windows. In addition, Apple green-lighted Skype 1.1 for the iPhone and iPod Touch, which you can download now.Skype 4.1 beta brought back features like accessibility, birthday reminders, and the capability to send a contact record to another contact. These had been left out when Skype first updated its interface to the 4.0 style, the company citing a wish to get core features out the door before piling on the extras. It's these extras that users nevertheless clamored for. This minor point update also contains a major new feature that was first introduced in Skype 4.1 beta: screen sharing.Screen sharing initiates a video call, using the technology to broadcast a recording of your screen--either a portion or the full screen--to one other viewer. Screen sharing has some limitations: you can't simultaneously see a video of your buddy and their desktop, and since only one viewer at a time can peep at your screen, you can't use it as a free replacement for collaborative Web conferencing. It doesn't help that the picture quality is still choppy and fuzzy, in both partial-screen and full-screen view modes.Make no mistake, though: it's a great feature that we're happy to see added, but we'll be even happier to watch it improve.In addition to screen sharing, Skype 4.1 lets you feed a contact search from outside address books, including those in Gmail, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Microsoft Outlook, and a host of other players. If you have it installed, the Web toolbar will highlight phone numbers within contact lists so you can call them through Skype.Skype 1.1 for iPhone and iPod Touch reintroduces the capability to listen to Skype voice mail and to send and receive SMS messages. These features had been available on the desktop version, but were not activated when Skype first came out for iPhone.There are a few visual tweaks, also, which gloss up the look and feel of a few screens, most notably the dial pad. To top off the changes, this iPhone update pours on multilingual support, making it available in Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, and Traditional Chinese.Skype for iPhone still has far to go if it's to get all of the extra features that round out the Skype experience--games and conference calling are but two. Push notification is another that Skype users are now asking for. Skype told CNET that they wanted to first integrate SMS and voice mail, the two most-requested features. As for push notification, Skype isn't making any commitments at this point, but a representative from the company vaguely stated, "Where we're able to use functionality provided by the iPhone OS to support a rich Skype experience on the iPhone platform, we will endeavor to do so." Still, it's a fair guess that a future version could notify you when someone is calling.In the future, we're looking forward to what Skype might do with video calls now that the iPhone 3GS has its shiny new video recorder.

A major security flaw that has existed in Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone since the device was first released in 2007 has been revealed by a well-known hacker. The iOS security researcher, known publicly only as “pod2g,” on Friday published details about the vulnerability, which affects all versions of iOS through to the latest beta release of iOS 6.According to pod2g’s report, the reply-to number that is displayed when an iPhone user views an SMS can easily be manipulated to display a number other than the one sending the message. Using a simple procedure, this exploit can be used by malicious attackers to send messages that appear to be from a trusted source — a bank, perhaps — but any replies to the SMS would be routed to a separate phone number without the sender’s knowledge.Pod2g notes that the iPhone is not the only handset vulnerable to the flaw.“In the text payload, a section called UDH (User Data Header) is optional but defines lot of advanced features not all mobiles are compatible with,” he explained. “One of these options enables the user to change the reply address of the text. If the destination mobile is compatible with it, and if the receiver tries to answer to the text, he will not respond to the original number, but to the specified one.”The researcher says this security flaw is severe and he urges users to be wary of any SMS messages asking for sensitive information.

A "serious memory corruption bug" in the iPhone can make it vulnerable to being taken over by a single specially-crafted text message, security researchers showed today. So if you get a text message that consists of a square on your iPhone - perhaps you should worry. Or, much more likely, it's a prank from a friend trying to freak you out. The Black Hat conference in Las Vegas saw a demonstration by Collin Mulliner and Charlie Miller, who are independent security experts, who proved the weakness by taking control of an iPhone belonging to CNet's Elinor Mills. Mills described it thus: While I was talking on the phone to Charlie Miller, his partner, Collin Mulliner, sent me a text message from his phone. One minute I'm talking to Miller and the next minute my phone is dead, and this time it's not AT&T's fault. After a few seconds it came back to life, but I was not able to make or receive calls until I rebooted. The researchers told Mills that "an attacker could exploit the hole to make calls, steal data, send text messages, and do basically anything that I can do with my iPhone". How many iPhones are vulnerable? All of them. How many will be affected? Ah, that's a lot harder. Not the majority. Not even a large minority. It depends on whether Apple can fix the problem before the malicious hackers out there figure out how the hack is done.

What's more annoying than spending hours lining up for a shiny new gadget? Learning that your precious phone can't actually connect to the network. Well, depending on how you hold it -- word has it that the iPhone 4's bottom-left corner isn't playing nice with your skin. If you recall from the keynote , that's where the Bluetooth / WiFi / GPS antenna meets its GSM / UMTS counterpart. So we decided to test on two brand new iPhone 4 handsets purchased today in the UK.One iPhone 4 demonstrated the issue everytime it was held in our left hand (as a right-handed person is apt to do) so that our palm was essentially bridging the two antennas. You can see that in the video after the break. Bridging the two with a finger tip, however, didn't cause any issues with the reported reception. If we had to guess, we'd say that our conductive skin was acting to detune the antenna -- in fact, we've already managed to slowly kill two calls that way so it's not just an issue with the software erroneously reporting an incorrect signal strength. That said, we had no issues when Apple's $29 rubber bumper accessory (given to us free for standing in line) was attached, creating a buffer between our palm and the antennas. Our second UK-purchased iPhone 4 was fine, showing none of these handling symptoms. See the video evidence after the break including Insanely Great Mac's version which got us to worrying in the first place.P.S. Don't forget to take our poll and let us know if you're seeing both the yellow spots / stripes and reception issues. Unfortunately, we're suffering from both flaws which is not a good sign for quality control on this first batch of Apple handsets.P.P.S. Since some of you are asking, our review unit showed none of these issues. Apple responds to the issue, and boy, it's a doozy

Apple on Wednesday apologized for technology issues that crippled the iPhone 4 pre-order process, but said that the company processed orders for 600,000 of the devices in one day.As a result, new orders will not ship until at least July 14, according to the Apple Web site."It was the largest number of pre-orders Apple has ever taken in a single day and was far higher than we anticipated, resulting in many order and approval system malfunctions," Apple said. "Many customers were turned away or abandoned the process in frustration. We apologize to everyone who encountered difficulties, and hope that they will try again or visit an Apple or carrier store once the iPhone 4 is in stock."The new iPhone 4 is not scheduled to hit stores until June 24, but Apple, AT&T and several other retail outlets started taking pre-orders for the device on June 15. Unfortunately, the companies' systems could not handle the extra demand, and many online buyers were met with timed-out browsers and 404 errors.Apple subsequently updated its Web site to say that pre-orders going forward will not ship until July 2. The company's pre-order site now says they will ship by July 14.Earlier today, AT&T said its pre-order sales were 10 times higher than pre-orders for the iPhone 3GS last year. Faced with this "unprecedented demand," AT&T suspended the pre-order process on Wednesday "in order to fulfill the orders we've already received."Apple's inventory will determine when AT&T resumes pre-orders, the company said.There were also reports that people trying to purchase the iPhone 4 accidentally saw the personal information of other iPhone customers. AT&T said it has "been unable to replicate the issue, but the information displayed did not include call-detail records, social security numbers, or credit card information.""In the meantime, we are looking into this matter," the company concluded.Radio Shack, which was accepting in-person pre-orders at its stores, also ended the program amidst demand. Wednesday afternoon, Best Buy said it too had suspended iPhone 4 pre-orders. Wal-Mart is expected to start selling the iPhone 4 in select stores starting June 24.Editor's Note: This story was updated at 4pm Eastern time with information from Best Buy.

Apple‘s iCloud service brings a whole raft of services — email, calendar, contacts, ‘Find My iPhone” and cloud storage — and stores them behind a single username and password. This is very convenient, but if that username and password falls into the wrong hands, you can find yourself very quickly in a world of pain.This is what happened to Mat Honan, former journalist for Gizmodo and former contributing editor to WIRED magazine. Before the hackers gained access to his Twitter account and that of Gizmodo, the hackers first gained access to his iCloud account, where they caused irrevocable havoc.At 4:50 PM, someone got into my iCloud account, reset the password and sent the confirmation message about the reset to the trash. My password was a 7 digit alphanumeric that I didn’t use elsewhere. When I set it up, years and years ago, that seemed pretty secure at the time. But it’s not. Especially given that I’ve been using it for, well, years and years. My guess is they used brute force to get the password, and then reset it to do the damage to my devices. The backup email address on my Gmail account is that same .mac email address. At 4:52 PM, they sent a Gmail password recovery email to the .mac account. Two minutes later, an email arrived notifying me that my Google Account password had changed. At 5:00 PM, they remote wiped my iPhone At 5:01 PM, they remote wiped my iPad At 5:05, they remote wiped my MacBook Air.I still can’t get into Gmail. My phone and iPads are down (but are restoring). Apple tells me that the remote wipe is likely irrecoverable without serious forensics. Because I’m a jerk who doesn’t back up data, I’ve lost at more than a year’s worth of photos, emails, documents, and more. And, really, who knows what else.To do all the damage all the hackers needed to do was to get their hands on a single username and password. Honan believes that this was done by a process called brute forcing, that is, trying passwords until you get lucky. It’s a long process, but if the password is simple or short enough, it’s doable. Short passwords are almost as bad as no password at all, in fact, they’re worse because they lull you into a false sense of security.As pointed out in the comments on Honan’s post, another problem with iCloud is that you only need a username and password to access the account, while Google accounts can be protected by a 2-step verification. Here, along with your username and password, you can set your Google account  to ask you for a six-digit code that Google will send via text message to your phone. While this is no doubt more hassle than just using just the username and password, it dramatically improves account security.If you have an iCloud account, let this be a warning to you. I suggest you change your password, and pick something long and random — I know I have.It’s a dangerous place out there!

Android fans, especially those of you who love your Samsung devices, might have something to cheer about today as it looks like Chinese phone maker GooPhone have already patented the design of the new iPhone 5 before Apple have had chance!November 2012 Update! GooPhone have just released details of the GooPhone i5!:GooPhone i5 iPhone 5 packaging is AWESOME!Official GooPhone i5 iPhone 5 specification is not so!If you’re not familiar with GooPhone then you might want to check out their latest phone the GooPhone i5 which is an Android smartphone based on the design of leaked iPhone 5 components which keep cropping up across China.Like the iPhone 5 design, the GooPhone I5 is basically a much larger iPhone 4S with a 4 inch screen, smaller dock connector and larger external speaker grills along with a headphone rack on the bottom rather than on the top.The most intriguing part of the GooPhone i5's design is the fact that GooPhone claim they have patented it in China, which could effectively block Apple from selling their next generation iPhone in the Chinese market, and may even mean GooPhone have the right to block iPhone 5 exports completely! GooPhone i5 iPhone 5 clone hands on GooPhone i5 SpecificationThe GooPhone i5 is expected to launch a little after the genuine iPhone 5 later this month and is said to feature an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core 1.4Ghz CPU, 1GB RAM, Android 4.0 ICS with an iOS 6 theme, 8 mega-pixel rear camera and a 4 inch screen with an impressive retina display resolution of 1280 x 720.More GooPhone i5 news coming soon!Beijing Start-up SoftCompass Taking on Microsoft in the presentation arena!

iPhone 4 users, did your alarm go off today? SINGAPORE : Some iPhone 4 users got off to a bad start in the New Year when the alarm function of their phones failed to go off, apparently due to a bug in the smart phone's operating system. The problem was first reported in Australia and New Zealand, which were the first countries to ring in the New Year. And complaints have come fast and furious on sites such as Twitter. iPhone user Ameer Assik Shahrir was one of those tripped up by the bug. He had set his alarm for 7.30am, but woke up only at 8.30am. He said: "This morning, I was late for breakfast by one hour, I was supposed to meet a few friends. "If this was a school day, I would have been late by one hour and it wouldn't be good." And it wasn't good at all for those who had to work on New Year's Day. One of them called the Channel NewsAsia hotline. Alex Lam said: "I set my alarm last night for 6.30 this morning. I only received a call from my colleague at 8am, and that was when I realised I was already late for work. "I immediately went to work and noticed my colleagues were also late because their iPhone alarms also did not go off." According to tech websites, users can avoid the problem by setting the alarm to the "repeat" mode. The alarm function can apparently revert to normal on January 3. Sites such as 9to5 Mac also report that only iPhones using specific versions of the iOS 4 operating system - in particular, the 4.2.1, 4.1 and 4.0.2 versions - may be affected. However, the extent of the problem is still unclear. IPhone maker Apple has not made an official comment yet. But it had promised an upgrade of the operating system soon, following similar glitches in November when the phone's clock failed to register the switch from daylight savings time. - CNA/wk/ms

Dozens of law-enforcement agencies across the U.S. are preparing to use a new, mobile facial-recognition tool to identify individuals. There's also an Android version in the works.Some law-enforcement agencies are preparing to deploy a mobile facial-recognition tool, The Wall Street Journal reported today.According to the Journal, about 40 law-enforcement agencies across the U.S. will be making the handheld product available to their officers in the field as early as September. The device, which has been developed by Massachusetts-based BI2 Technologies, allows officers to take a photo of a person from a distance of five feet or less. That photo is then compared with a database of images of people with criminal records to see if there is a match. The device is also capable of scanning a person's iris.Like with any other platform, there are some limitations with BI2's device. For one, it needs to be attached to the back of an iPhone in order to work, which leaves out agencies using Android, Windows Phone, or any other devices. According to the Journal, BI2 will offer an Android-capable version "in the future" but didn't say when.In addition, BI2's database isn't necessarily exhaustive. The Journal said that it includes photos of correctional facility inmates but that only a few states are allowing the company to access mug shots. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal logs, as well as photos on driver's licenses, are not included in the database.Facial recognition has always been a hot-button issue for privacy advocates, and BI2's technology likely will face the same concerns. Realizing that, Sheriff Paul Babeu of Arizona's Pinal County told the Journal that his officers will only use the tool when a person of interest isn't carrying any form of identification. What's more, he said, his officers will not use it without cause.Facial recognition came back into the forefront of the privacy debate last month when the European Union decided to examine Facebook's facial-recognition feature to whether it violates any privacy regulations.That decision followed a claim by CNN that Google was working on a facial-recognition application. Immediately, Google fired back, saying that it wasn't doing anything of the sort.At the D9 Conference in May, Google's former CEO and current executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, acknowledged that Google had come close to offering facial recognition in its Google Goggles image-recognition service, but Schmidt stopped it before it could launch. He said he was concerned that facial recognition can be used for both good and bad.Even so, the company has been involved with facial recognition in the past, offering the technology in its Picasa photo-management service.For law-enforcement agencies, there are also legal implications of facial recognition. As the Journal points out, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that agencies must have "reasonable suspicion" in order to fingerprint an individual. Whether agencies need to have the same "suspicion" to use BI2's tool remains to be seen.Regardless, it seems that at least some law-enforcement agencies believe the technology will be extremely beneficial. In an Arizona Republic article posted on BI2's site, Babeu said that the technology has been valuable on multiple levels for law-enforcement agencies."From an officer-safety perspective, to find out who we are dealing with, this literally leapfrogged us ahead in the ability of law enforcement to best protect our community," Babeu said.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- If you've ever wanted to know how much money Apple (AAPL) is making on each iPhone you buy, here's your chance.The iPhone is the most profitable, and ultimately the most popular, product in Apple's portfolio, based on revenue and sales. Even with a sales shortfall, Apple still sold an impressive 26 million iPhones in the third quarter. Research firm IHS has come up with the cost of manufacturing the iPhone 5, and, unsurprisingly, Apple's estimated margins are astounding.The cost of the new iPhone 5 sets Apple back between $207 and $238, according to IHS, depending on whether the model is the 16 GB, the 32 GB, or the 64 GB version. At $649 for the 16 GB model, Apple is generating $442 per phone in profits, excluding outside expenses. While Apple's spend on marketing, advertising, employees, and other expenses, is unknown (Apple doesn't break down its cost of sales), the tech giant's could be generating margins of at least 68% on the iPhone 5.See if ( AAPL) is in our portfolioThis is pretty impressive, especially when you think about all the new features on the iPhone 5 such as LTE, an in-cell display and a new A6 processor.Apple's component costs include, but are not limited to, parts from SanDisk (SNDK), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM), and lest we forget, Samsung, which is a "frenemy.""While most manufacturers make great effort to simplify designs by minimizing the total number of mechanical parts and fasteners in their products, Apple appears to be going in the other direction with the iPhone 5," said Kevin Keller, senior principal analyst, teardown analysis, for IHS. "The iPhone 5 incorporates even more mechanical parts than previous iPhone designs, resulting in a very complex assembly. But Apple can do this and still produce the iPhone 5 at such low costs due to its capability to leverage its vast army of low-cost labor."The ability of Apple to lead the smartphone industry in margins has been one of the principal reasons shares are up more than 70% year-to-date. Margins for older iPhones, such as the 4 and 4S, are likely higher, as costs have gone down.Now you have an idea how much money Apple is making when you buy the iPhone 5.Interested in more on Apple?

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- European telcos are likely to subsidize Apple's new version of the iPhone, say analysts.Exclusive Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) partner O2 is expected to sell the hotly-anticipated 3G iPhone for about $196 or £100, according to a report by the U.K's Times Online, citing a UBS analyst report. The speculation follows a story first reported by Fortune.com that AT&T (T, Fortune 500) was planning to sell the new iPhone this summer for around $200.Apple CEO Steve Jobs is widely expected to unveil the faster, sleeker version of the iPhone during the company's developer conference in one week. The new iPhone would be available later this month in the U.S. through Apple and AT&T. AT&T pricing strategy calls for a $200 subsidy for customers who sign two-year service contracts."It will be subsidized," says CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood, of O2's iPhone price plan. "But it won't be free," Wood speculates. O2 customers "will have to take connections or contracts at the point of purchase. They will have to sign on the dotted line. That's how they will make sure they get their money back," says Wood.The lower-priced phones in the U.S. and potentially the U.K. and other parts of Europe would help juice the iPhone's sales volume and give the telcos an attractive weapon to win new subscribers.In the United States, AT&T says it pulls in an average of $95 a month from each iPhone customer, nearly twice the average monthly bill of its conventional cell phone user. AT&T has a revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires it to give Apple as much as 25% of its iPhone customers' monthly payments.Subsidies are a widespread pricing practice in the United States and overseas. In exchange for a cheaper phone, customers are locked in to a carrier for a year or two. It's a small investment by the telcos for a large return, as Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi outlined in a report last month.Cutting the price of the iPhone in half would put the cost of the phone within reach of more consumers and likely double the number of iPhones sold, Sacconaghi argues. After giving Apple its cut of the revenue, the remaining take for AT&T is between $70 and $75 a month per iPhone user, totaling more than $1,700 over the life of the two-year contract, wrote Sacconaghi.Though it didn't get much attention at the time, on anApril 23 conference call with analysts, Apple CFO Tim Cook said the company didn't put price guidelines on European carriers selling the original iPhone."The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that, I wouldn't comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential," Cook said at the time.One thing is clear, the iPhone's manufacturer's suggested retail price of $400 seems more fluid than ever."There's certainly more flexibility in pricing," says CCS Insight's Wood.

2008 was a big turning point for Japanese mobile industry. In early 2008, Japanese ministry of internal affairs and communications asked all the mobile phone operators to change the way they sell their cell phones.  Before that Japan was abundant of 1 yen cell phones and even 0 yen cell phones with the real cost hidden in the 2 year contract and higher than international average monthly fee. The ministry asked to display the real cost of the phone unit at the store front. And because R&D cost for the Japanese high-tech phones kept going up for the past few years, the customers finally realized the real cost of the handset were actually more than 30,000 yen (about $300) for the mid-range and more than 80,000 yen ($800) for the high-end phones.  Although, few people are paying it in full and are rather paying it monthly for 2 years; still this notion of the real price deeply discouraged people from buying a new phone.  Then came the bad economy.  So 2008 was the year that Japanese mobile phone industry sunk; the total unit shipment of all operators combined went down for 18.7% (according to Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association) to 42 million units which makes iPhone almost has the 1% share; In January 2007, Steve Jobs said he will have 1% share of the worldwide market.   Well, in Japan, too. They got that number of share in this very competitive market.I use it to get on train (so I don't need to purchase tickets), with it I don't have to go to the counter at the airport and go directly to the boarding gate (because it works as your electronic ticke for airplane, too). I can ride a taxi with it and buy almost anything and eat/drink any thing at any of those shopping complex run by Japanese Railways group. But if that turns out to harm the iPhone sales in Japan, I think Apple will change their deal with SoftBank and start selling iPhone through NTT DoCoMo as well. Actually, Japanese press, including me, has been writing this for a long time; and I think this has been harming SoftBank iPhone sales, too. Those iPhone fans who use NTT DoCoMo right now kind of waited until the DoCoMo version comes out. Some gave up and switched to SoftBank, some can't switch, so they added iPhone as the second phone, but there are still many who can't take either way and sticking with the old NTT DoCoMo phone.I believe you will be only using a small portion of this e-mail in your article. So if you don't mind, I would like to edit this a bit and post to my English blog because I haven't updated that for a while;  perhaps, with an affiliated link to the issue of Wired magazine, you will be writing this article for or something.

This is complete speculation based on the facts we know. Apple gets a share of the profit from AT&T iPhone subscribers. Gene Munster in 2007 suggested that Apple is getting $18/mo per iPhone subscriber from AT&T. BUT, what if that number is based on net profit?Yesterday (Aug 1) the Washington Post published an article to which AT&T replied that:BUT.. What if Apple was being paid profit based on usage? So, instead of the $18/mo that was suggested in 2007, what if it was really a percentage? Apps like Skype, Fring, Slingbox, Google Voice, etc. that would cause AT&T to spend more money relative to some baseline usage scenario, would in effect cost Apple money.Imagine it this way. If you're a normal iPhone user who's paying around $90/mo for service, and you use your phone what AT&T and Apple consider an "Average" amount, Apple is paid 20%, or $18. But, there is an increased cost to AT&T if you use your phone substantially more than Average. Let's say, the cost to provide service to an Average customer is $54, which means the net profit is $36. Apple and AT&T split that amount. (These numbers are made up to show my idea.. just bear with me). But, for a high-usage account, the cost to provide service might be closer to $75. That means there's only $15 net profit for AT&T and Apple to share. Apple suddenly loses $10.50 per subscriber, per month that uses at the higher level. (Again, 50% of $15 = $7.50. $18-$7.50 = $10.50)If AT&T is correct, and they really didn't have anything to do with the App removal, and Apple IS to blame, this scenario fits. It explains why Apple restricts high bandwidth apps. They want to keep the cost of the service low to maximize their profit.Again, this is speculation.. But, it's not something I've seen ANYONE else suggest. Am I totally out-to-lunch? Did I just hit the nail on the head? Let me know!

Apple (AAPL) customers are famed for their loyalty, but it looks as though some of them may not be as fanatical as they’ve been in the past. New data from Strategy Analytics shows that 75% of iPhone owners in Western Europe said they would buy an Apple device for their next smartphone, versus 88% who said they’d buy an iPhone for their next device last year. iPhone user loyalty also dipped slightly in the United States, with 88% of iPhone owners saying they’d buy an Apple smartphone in the future, down from 93% last year. Paul Brown, the director at Strategy Analytics’ User Experience Practice, said that Apple’s loyalty numbers may have taken a hit because of “negative press prompted by a perceived lack of recent innovation.” Strategy Analytics’ press release is posted below.Boston, MA – October 30, 2012 – For the first time since the Apple iPhone was released in 2007, the number of iPhone owners who say they definitely will or probably will purchase their next phone from the same brand has declined.The recent Strategy Analytics Wireless Device Lab Report, iPhone Owner Loyalty Declines: Is Apple Losing its Innovation Edge?, found that only 75 percent of iPhone owners in Western Europe say they are likely to buy their next phone from Apple, down from 88 percent in 2011. US repeat purchase intentions have also seen a slight decline, down from 93 percent in 2011 to 88 percent in 2012.“There is no doubt that Apple is continuing its success in retaining existing user base while attracting new customers,” commented Paul Brown, Director at Strategy Analytics’ User Experience Practice. “However, negative press prompted by a perceived lack of recent innovation by Apple has meant we are starting to see some growth in the number of previously highly loyal consumers who are now reconsidering whether or not they will purchase a new iPhone for their next device.”Taryn Tulay, Analyst at Strategy Analytics’ Wireless Device Lab added, “Respondents who say they probably will or definitely will not buy their next phone from Apple is low. However, it is the shift in the number of those who are unsure whether they will remain with the same brand for their next phone that Apple should be concerned about.”

Apple has quietly enabled a mobile ads tracking system in iOS 6, with unique per-device identifiers that provide advertisers with more user information than ever before. Having blocked developers from using UDID codes – device-specific codes that could be monitored to see if adverts led to app downloads – Apple replaced the unofficial functionality with an official version, IFA/IFDA (Identifier For Advertising) that comes automatically set active, Business Insider reports.Unlike UDID numbers, which are assigned to the device and cannot be changed, IFA codes are designed to be ephemeral. Created randomly and then anonymously assigned to a phone or tablet, they transiently link publishers serving up adverts and the ad servers so that an appropriate advert is displayed on subsequent browsing.If you go on to download an app, the ad server can see what led you to that download, something which was impossible to track previously. There’s no personally-identifiable data, but the fact that Apple has it turned on by default might frustrate or upset some privacy advocates.IFA can be switched off on iOS 6 devices, though the setting to do so isn’t where you’d perhaps first expect. Rather than being part of the Privacy options, it’s under General > About > Advertising, and labeled “Limit Ad Tracking”; for IFA to be deactivated, the switch must – arguably counter-intuitively – be set to “on” rather than “off.”“The biggest thing we’re excited about is that it’s on by default, so we expect most people will leave it on” ad provider Mobile Theory’s CEO Scott Swanson told BI, saying that while the data was personally non-identifiable, it nonetheless provided “a really meaningful inference of behavior” previously unavailable to advertisers.

We all saw this one coming a mile away: Apple is finally being taken to task over iOS 4 performance on the iPhone 3G. In a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of California for San Diego, plaintiff Biana Wofford alleges that Apple purposely crippled the iPhone 3G with its introduction of iOS 4 in order to boost iPhone 4 sales, and hopes to get her lawsuit elevated to class action status.Apple originally marketed iOS 4 as a major upgrade for iPhone 3G and 3GS users. That operating system came out just days before Apple started selling the iPhone 4 to the public, but iPhone 3G users quickly learned that it wasn't what they had been hoping for. There were soon widespread reports of extremely slow and buggy performance of iOS 4 on the iPhone 3G, not to mention the fact that the iPhone 3G didn't get all of the features that came with iOS 4 in the first place.According to Wofford's complaint, Apple knew that the update from iOS 3.x would turn her iPhone 3G into a "device with little more use than that of a paper weight." She also criticized Apple over the difficulty in downgrading to a previous operating system without having to become a "hacker"—indeed, it's no simple task for average users to roll back if they have already upgraded to the newest operating system."Even though Apple has actual knowledge of thousands of complaints from iPhone 3G/3GS consumers, Apple does not allow for those same users/consumers of third generation devices to download and re-install earlier and optimized iOS3.x operating system without resorting to 'hacker' tactics that will void Apple warranties and violate iPhone user agreements," Wofford wrote.Wofford believes that Apple did this all to leave iPhone 3G users with unusable phones, forcing them to upgrade to the newly released iPhone 4. What's unclear is whether Wofford attempted to go to an Apple Store or call AppleCare for help on her issue before filing the lawsuit. Regardless, she accuses Apple of engaging in false advertising and unfair competition, and wants the court to give her (and other class members) restitution and damages.On the one hand, this case seems to join the countless others filed by unsatisfied customers over iPhone-related issues. On the other, it's a somewhat new angle—the iOS 4 performance problems on iPhone 3G are pretty well documented (we've experienced them ourselves), and she does have a point that it's not easy to downgrade the OS once you've committed to upgrading. Though we wouldn't be surprised if this case ended up disappearing into the lawsuit black hole, it's possible Apple will eventually institute some sort of policy that lets people use iTunes to go back to a previous OS if they so choose.

Last month, after reading about it on TechCrunch, I downloaded and tried Earthscape, a program for the iPhone that mimicked much of what the wonderful Google Earth does on traditional computer. Unfortunately, I found it to be a disappointment – it was slow and hard to use. It left me pining for a real Google Earth on the iPhone, and I deleted it.Sunday, my desire for the real thing was fulfilled. Google Earth was released for the iPhone, and it’s a spectacular app that you’ll want immediately.As with the desktop version, you begin with the Earth floating in space. Tapping on the image zooms in, and you can use the pinching gesture to more precisely zoom in and out.Continue to tap, and you’ll eventually be down to street level.Google Earth uses the accelerometer in the iPhone to let you move around on the map, or angle it for a horizon view.As with Google Maps on the iPhone, it works with the device’s GPS. Tapping the locator icon in the lower left-hand corner of the screen takes you to your current location, indicated by the familiar blue dot.Google Earth for the desktop features multiple layers, so you can overlay information on top of the maps. For now, there are only two layers in the iPhone version. You an get Wikipedia information for a specific location if the appropriate article has been geo-tagged. There don’t seem to be too many of these, but perhaps the release of this software will encourage authors to geotag more Wikipedia entries.And see the little blue squares in the screen shots above? Those are where photos have been tagged with location data in Panaramio, a site designed to link images with spots on the globe. Tapping on one of the squares brings up an image at that location.Google Earth for iPhone duplicates some of the features in the Google Maps application, such as being able to search for local businesses. The two are semi-linked – you can tap on a location in Google Earth and go to the same spot in Google Maps, but not vice versa. To get back to Google Earth, it must re-launch, a downside of Apple not allowing apps to run in the background on the iPhone.There are a few annoyances. The accelerometer is sensitive, and easy for the screen to "drift" away from the view you want. Fortunately, you can turn off this feature. Also, Google Earth starts with the globe view every time it starts, then slowly zooms back down to the vicinity of your last location. This gets old quickly.Finally, because it uses your phone’s GPS, your battery level takes a beating – particularly since this app is so much fun, you’ll spend a lot of time working with it.If you’re an iPhone or iPod Touch user, you’ll want to get this application ASAP. It’s free, as you’d expect.Read more at the Google Earth blog. I also like Harry McCracken’s review at Technologizer.

 Bill Nye the Science Guy was gracious enough to elbow Matt out of the way and write a Giz Explains column, in which he tackles the science of "oleophobia," and its relation to the new iPhone screen.The new 3GS iPhone has a coating that helps you leave no, well hardly any, printsâ€“-fingerprints. The glass screen is coated with a polymer, a plastic that human skin oil doesn't adhere to very well. People in the chemical bonding business like to call the finished surface "oleophobic."Such a lovely Greek cognate may sound like it means "afraid of oil." And, it does, but it also connotes (or carries with) "aversion" or "not-like-to-be-around-tivity," if I may. Instead of sticking to the bonded-plastic surface of your new phone, the oil from you fingers or cheekbone or tip of your nose stays more or less together as its own smooshed droplet.The Applers were able to do this by bonding this oleophobic polymer to glass. The polymer is an organic (from organisms) compound, carbon-based. The glass is nominally inorganic, silicon-basedâ€¦ solid rock. The trick is getting the one to stick to the other. Although it is nominally proprietary, this is probably done with a third molecule that sticks to silicon on one side and to carbon-based polymers on the other side. Chemical engineers get it to stay stuck by inducing compounds to diffuse or "inter-penetrate" into the polymer. The intermediate chemical is a "silane," a molecule that has silicon and alkanes (chains of carbon atoms).If you'd likeâ€”and I hope you willâ€”take a moment and think about droplets, like water droplets, on a surface. Deep in the droplet, water molecules stick to each other. On the surface though, they stick to each other as well, but they also have to opportunity to stick or not to stick to the surface they're resting on. When they stick, say to the nylon fibers in a bikini strap, the swimsuit feels wet (or so I'm told). When they don't stick to the surface they're resting on, they bead up, like in the car wax commercials.Well, the polymer that the 3GS iPhone screen is coated with doesn't let the oil of your skin stick to it very much. So, you don't leave fingerprints. The key is in the intermediate compounds, the silanes that hold the plastic to the glass.So grab a hold of one, and for a change, watch almost nothing happen. It's chemistry.

George Hotz (aka Geohot), the developer who had released popular jailbreaking and unlocking tools like blackra1n, blacksn0w has published a new blog post to report that he has jailbroken iPhone 4.In April, there were speculations that Geohot will release an untethered jailbreak for iPhone OS 3.1.3 and iOS 4 called limera1n as he had bought a domain. Geohot had taken part in Nuit Du Hack conference held in Paris at the end of June, where he mentioned that he had found a new bootrom exploit, which can ultimately pwn all iPhones for life, including iPhone 4. He has named this exploit as pwned4life.Geohot talks about jailbreaking iPhone 4, limera1n and pwned4life in his blog post:Got one of these in the mail today and figured I’d give it a shot. As far as a release goes, it probably won’t happen from me. limera1n is little more than a raindrop on a website; it was never mentioned by me previous to this post. pwned4life is a complete invention of some blogger in a basement somewhere. When I said pwned for life, I was referring to the original iPhone, 3G, and Touch; which of course are, by the aptly named PwnageTool. Again, please don’t ask for release dates. Every person that does makes me want to release a little bit less.Another Developer, Comex had also announced  a Userland jailbreak which is ready for the iPhone 4 ( expected after iOS 4.01 / 4.1 release).Stay tuned for more jailbreak and unlocking info by following us on Twitter and/or subscribing to our RSS feeds.

Apple said its iPhone, iPad and Mac computers collect location information, but do so anonymously in batches and encrypt it before sending the data over a WiFi connection from the devices to Apple's servers every 12 hours.The normally super-secretive company shed light on its data collection practices for location-based services in a July 12 letter, responding to a list of questions from U.S. Reps. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Joe L. Barton (R-Texas).The Congressmen June 24 sent Apple a letter demanding to know about the company's practice of collecting, storing and sharing the location of users' mobile devices.Apple June 21 changed its iTunes privacy policy to reflect how it collects data about the location of Apple devices consumers purchase.Apple, which will not let users download any applications from the iTunes store without agreeing to the new terms and conditions, shares location data with application providers when consumers opt in to providers' location services.    "To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services."That policy change spurred concern among Congressmen Barton and Markey, who sentApple a list of nine questions about this practice, which is becoming more pronounced among providers of Web services.Bruce Sewell, general counsel and senior vice president of legal and government affairs for Apple, pointed out that Apple, like Google and other companies providing location-based services, uses cell tower and WiFi information to collect data from users' iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.Apple offers location-based services on the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iphone 4, iPad WiFi/3G and on older iPhones, iPad WiFi iPod touch and Macs running Snow Leopard, and Windows or Macs running the Safari 5 Web browser, albeit to a more limited extent.However, this only happens when users have toggled their device to turn the services on and only when the user runs an application requiring location information.At that point the device "intermittently and anonymously collects cell tower and WiFi access point information from the access points it can see, along with the device's GPS coordinates if available."Web services that leverage location such as Google Latitude, Google Buzz, Twitter Foursquare and Gowalla are becoming increasingly popular among users. Google, Yahoo and Bing are negotiating with Foursquare to use its location-based check-in data in their core search results.The Congressmen nodded to this fact and appreciated Apple's detailed response."As more Americans rely on location-based services as part of their everyday lives, it is imperative that consumers have control over how their personal information is used, transmitted and stored," Markey wrote."Apple's responses provided additional information about how it uses location data and the ability of consumers to exercise control over a variety of features on Apple's products, and I appreciate the company's response."He added that he was satisfied that Apple adequately lets users grant or withhold consent in their usage of Apple products, adding that consumer consent is the key to assessing the adequacy of privacy protections."Our personal information has moved from our wallets and home filing cabinets, to the file cabinets of data brokers and online files of behavioral advertisers and now, directly to the Internet cloud from our mobile devices. Consumers must be made aware of this collection and they must consent to giving it up."Barton did admonish Apple for writing privacy policies "that run on for pages and pages," which most people won't bother to read.

A day after President Barack Obama won a second term, stocks suffered their worst beating in nearly a year. Late selling caused to the $INDU ) to finish down more than 300 points, its largest loss since Nov. 9, 2011. The blue-chip index ended the day below 13,000 for the first time since Aug. 2, and the major U.S. averages were all down at least 2.4%. Bank stocks were the weakest sector in part because it's likely the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill will remain largely intact. In addition, Elizabeth Warren, a critic of many U.S. banking practices, won a seat in the U.S. Senate. JPM ), a critic of bank regulation, was down $2.32 to $40.56. Health insurance stocks were lower because the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Reform Act -- aka Obamacare -- is likely to stay in place.Meanwhile, oil prices fell back sharply in part because of worries about global demand. Europe became a worry after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said he expected no change to the weak eurozone economy in the near future. Worse, he said, the weakness has begun to affect Germany. European stocks immediately sold off -- and sharply, too. The dollar rose against the euro and British pound.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has underlined his love for Android handsets, stating his gripes with the iPhone and why in many ways he prefers Google's OS.He even claimed voice commands worked better on Android, as does the GPS system, the Daily Beast reports.“My primary phone is the iPhone, I love the beauty of it. But I wish it did all the things my Android does, I really do,” said Woz.“If you’re willing to do the work to understand it a little bit, well I hate to say it, but there’s more available in some ways.”Woz feels the battle between Apple and Android is reminiscent of the rivalry between Windows and Macintosh during the 1990s, when Microsoft dominated the market after licensing its software to third-party manufacturers. The theory goes that Android is doing the same to Apple, slowly taking over through sheer volume.Unfortunately for the Cupertino giant, Woz reckons it is up against a stronger competitor this time.“There’s not as big a difference [between iOS and Android] as there was between Mac and Windows,” he said before highlighting Apple's strict app approval process as a hindrance that may give the edge to Android.While Apple has worked hard to promote Siri, its voice-recognition-based assistant for iPhone 4S, Woz stressed his disappointment with it.“I have a lower success rate with Siri than I do with the voice built into the Android," he blurted before stating his view that Android is "way ahead on navigation" and slating the iPhone's battery life.Woz does still recommend the iPhone as the best choice for most, though, redeeming his gripes in the eyes of fanboys.“The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it’s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don’t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person, who is scared of complexity, well, here’s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do.”Ooh, that was a close one, Woz. ®

Apple launched the iPhone 4 in 17 additional countries today, causing another round of debate over whether or not the iPhone 4's external antenna design is flawed or not. A UK consulting firm says its tests show the "death grip" problem is real, and "significantly" worse for the iPhone 4 than other smartphones. A review from Norway is less critical, suggesting the iPhone 4 gets better signal than competing phones and may be victim to AT&T's less "robust" wireless network.Shortly after the iPhone 4 began shipping in the US last month, users started to notice a problem: gripping the device in a certain way led to signal attenuation and, in some cases, dropped calls or poor data connections. While Apple CEO Steve Jobs was somewhat dismissive of the issue early on, testing conclusively demonstrated that the iPhone 4 had a higher signal attenuation than other smartphones when bridging a small gap on the lower left side of the device's stainless steel bezel. Apple later held a press conference that attempted to demonstrate that competing smartphones had "similar" problems, and that Apple had done its due diligence to thoroughly test the antenna before the iPhone 4 was released. Apple decided to offer all users a free iPhone 4 case to mitigate the problem while the company researched the matter further.Lest you thought the whole ordeal was over, however, UK-based PA Consulting Group performed its own analysis, using tests similar to those performed by Consumer Reports and others. Those tests are in line with what we have already seen: the iPhone 4 has a bigger problem with signal loss than other smartphones. PA's wireless expert Simon Tonks concluded that "the 'death grip' issue is real, and is worse for the Apple iPhone 4 than for other smartphones." He also added, "The iPhone 4's radio performance was also found to be generally at the lower end."Testing done on live networks in Norway show a similar problem, albeit with some caveats. Norway's Verdens Gang newspaper's testing (Norwegian) led it to the conclusion that some of the blame can be laid at the foot of wireless providers, such as AT&T in the US. Testing there noted the same "death grip" signal loss issue observed elsewhere, but also showed the iPhone performing better than the others in areas of very low signal strength.These reports are more evidence that Apple's design choices with the iPhone 4 have led to a very real problem with dropped signals. While little new light has been shed on the topic, Apple has promised to share any new findings on September 30, when the current free case program is set to expire.

One-Third of iPhone Users Mistakenly Think They Have 4G new survey from Retrevo Maybe the "4" in the iPhone 4 name gives iPhone owners (34%) the false impression that they already own a 4G phone but the fact is Apple doesn't offer a 4G phone at the moment. Coincidentally, a suspiciously large percentage of Android and BlackBerry owners may be suffering from the same delusion. BlackBerry owners (24%) are almost as confused as iPhone owners since RIM doesn't currently offer a 4G phone. At least some Android owners could be answering correctly as Android 4G phones like the HTC Evo 4G or Samsung Infuse 4G have been available for some time. If nothing else this large number of "misinformed" phone owners serves to emphasize the fact that consumers are quite confused about 4G. technically make the iPhone a 4G deviceOne-Third of iPhone Users Mistakenly Think They Have 4G According to a new survey from Retrevo , 34% of iPhone users are under the mistaken impression that they already have "4G" cellular technology on their devices, highlighting the confusion that has resulted from shifting definitions of just what constitutes "4G" speeds.Confusing the issue is the fact that the marketing term "4G" is now being used to apply to not only the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology being rolled out by Verizon and other carriers but also HSPA+ networks such as those run by AT&T and T-Mobile. In addition, carriers running HSPA+ and LTE network won't necessarily all be offering the same speeds for a given standard, resulting in a spectrum of data speeds for consumers to compare. Apple is not expected to offer LTE support in the next-generation iPhone, but has been said to be supporting HSPA+, which would technically make the iPhone a 4G device on GSM carriers that support the HSPA+ standard. But consumers appear willing to embrace the next iPhone even if it doesn't have 4G capabilities, with 40% of current iPhone owners stating they will be buying the next iPhone even without 4G and an additional 21% stating that they would consider purchasing it. Significant percentages of current Android and BlackBerry owners are also registering interest in the next iPhone, with or without 4G.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureiPhone users expecting their Passcode Lock to prevent thieves running up their bill will be disappointed, as it emerges that the "Emergency Call" button actually allows any number to be dialled.While most users are happy to keylock their iPhone with the sliding finger, some opt to configure a passcode to lock the device more effectively - suffering the inconvenience of entering their PIN every time they use the phone. But while that process will protect data on the device (unlike last time) it won't stop a pickpocket running up your phone bill by making calls to any number.But it neglects to define what numbers constitute an emergency, and it turns out that, in the UK at least, the user is permitted to call anyone they wish.This could be described as a feature - one man's emergency is another's routine call - but we can't help wondering if the typical user is really aware of this particular feature, or if the manual could have been a bit more explicit in stating that someone experiencing an emergency is free to call on support from anywhere. ®

Last month, I wrote about two different Reddit applications for the iPhone, neither one actually made by the social voting site. While both were pretty good, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian clearly thought an official one could do a bit better — so they made one.Due to hit the App Store shortly, iReddit has all the features you’d expect from a Reddit iPhone app: voting, commenting and the ability to switch to different sub-Reddits. It also has some features the other Reddit apps didn’t have, such as the ability to easily switch between “Hot,” “New,” “Top,” and “Controversial” stories in any category — these classifications are a staple of the main Reddit site. This app also features story thumbail pictures (an option that can be toggled off as well).iReddit also has a unique flair that makes some iPhone apps stand out. For example, while the app is pretty fast, it loads all the stories’ actual websites through the app’s web browser, and it can take a bit of time for some of those page to load. So Ohanian chose to use that load time to me a quirky Reddit alient page load overlay (see the video below).But better is iReddits “shake for a new story” feature. Ohanian notes that the inspiration from this came form another great iPhone app, UrbanSpoon. That app works by giving your restaurant recommendations when you shake the iPhone thanks to the device’s accelerometer. iReddit has an option to use an iPhone shake to load what’s called “Serendipity” mode. A Star Wars lightsaber-like sound lets you know you’re entering it, and a big red “Serendipity” banner across the top lets you know that you’re in the mode.While in Serendipity mode, you will keep getting fed random stories to view/vote on every time you hit the “Hit me”  button or shake the iPhone. Clicking “No More!!!” will take you back to regular mode. Much like UrbanSpoon, I could see this Serendipity mode becoming addicting. It’s a bit like a completely random StumbleUpon (a website discovery tool), but again, using the iPhone’s accelerometer.Such a feature seems perfect for a social voting site, where users are often looking for new and interesting stories. The biggest of these sites, Digg, still does not have a native iPhone app.iReddit is fast, solid and yet quirky enough to stand above the other third-party Reddit apps. My only complaint is a minor one: that you can’t see the Reddit vote counts without clicking on a story. I’ve also had some issues loading the site’s custom Reddits, but the developers are aware of the issue and are looking into it.iReddit should be available soon in the App Store for $1.99 — cheaper than Satellite, the better of the twounofficial Reddit apps, which is $4.99, but more expensive than the one previously known as “reddit” but now called “open source reddit,” which is free. But I’m told that a free version of iReddit which is ad-supported will be made available in the next month or two as well.

Recently, AT&T has been vocally combating Verizon’s ad campaign by using semantics and Luke Wilson to paint their competitor’s 3G network as inferior. Now, Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility, is taking on a new opponent: customers.De la Vega has come out to candidly admit that wireless coverage in Manhattan and San Francisco is, as most customers already know, subpar (but, they’re working on it). However, while discussing efforts to improve the AT&T experience in those cities, de la Vega also insinuated that the carrier could start treating some customers differently, with different pricing plans that financially reward or penalize based on data usage.The Wall Street Journal is reporting that heavy smartphone users only represent about 3 percent of the customer base, but their mobile activities are accounting for 40 percent of data traffic. That imbalance is disconcerting to AT&T, and they’re going to do everything in their power — reportedly inline with net-neutrality and FCC regulations — to, as de la Vega says, “keep those subscribers from hampering the experience for everyone else.”So what will AT&T do to curtail their users? Apparently de la Vega is considering offering these data hogs (i.e. me) incentives to alter their mobile consumption rates. The incentives sound more like a warning:“Many customers don’t know how much bandwidth they’re consuming, Mr. de la Vega added. When AT&T conducted a broadband test, customers often reduced their data use. Longer-term, he said, a pricing scheme based on usage is likely, though it will be determined by industry competition and regulatory guidelines.”Although the details are vague, we can’t imagine iPhone owners, who are the most likely culprits here, will be keen on de la Vega’s “incentives.”s

Apple (AAPL) launched the fastest-selling smartphone in history in late September and the company went on to post a record September quarter, during which it earned $8.2 billion in profit on $36 billion in sales. The company also issued impressive guidance for the holiday quarter, anticipating a record $52 billion in revenue. Since Apple’s stock hit a record high when the iPhone 5 launched, however, it has lost more than $130 billion in market value — closing at $558 on Wednesday, down nearly 21% since late September. Why is Apple’s stock tanking as the company continues to break record after record? Wall Street.As dominant as Apple is right now, Wall Street analysts continue to issue sky-high estimates that hammer the company when it can’t meet them. This is the game we play, of course, and while Apple’s stock soared when it was regularly beating estimates, it is now heading back down to Earth as analysts adjusted by raising expectations even further.When Apple only pulled in $8.2 billion in profit last quarter, it was a miss. And when the company only sold 3 million iPads during the iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad’s opening weekend, it was a miss. Now, a number of analysts are pushing the stock down further — DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach, for example, sent shares of Apple down further when he went on CNBC and said Apple’s stock is headed to $425.Even analysts that will remain bullish on Apple until the day it dissolves are inadvertently contributing to the stock’s tumble. When Apple sold a record 5 million iPhone 5 handset during the phone’s debut weekend, the company’s stock slipped because Apple bulls like Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster were calling for opening-weekend sales to reach as high as 10 million units.Will Wall Street lead to Apple’s ultimate demise? Is it even the Street’s fault or is Apple done innovating? Apple may very well be in decline, but beginning to panic in the midst what is shaping up to be the biggest quarter in history for a consumer electronics company may be somewhat premature, especially when most analysts’ fiscal 2013 estimates remain sky-high.

When Steve Jobs first dreamed up the iPhone with his team at Apple, he didn't want it to run on AT&T's network. He wanted to create his own network.So says Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Stanton, who spent a good deal of time with the late Apple CEO during the phone's development period. Jobs wanted to replace carriers completely, Stanton says, instead using the unlicensed spectrum that WiFi operates on for his phone."He and I spent a lot of time talking about whether synthetically you could create a carrier using WiFi spectrum," Stanton said on Monday at the Law Seminar International Event in Seattle. "That was part of his vision."Both WiFi and cellular frequencies belong on the ultra-high-frequency level of the radio frequency spectrum. WiFi takes up five channels of the 2.4 GHz band. Other frequency bands are allotted to various purposes and cellular providers by the FCC.Jobs gave up his plans to create his own network in 2007, ultimately settling on a deal with AT&T.When Jobs debuted the iPhone, it marked a huge change in the way phone makers and carriers developed a device. Jobs sold AT&T Apple's iPhone sight unseen. Previously, carriers were an integral part of device development, adding tweaks, features and software throughout the process. Not so with the iPhone. Apple orchestrated the entire phone experience, while AT&T was simply afforded the opportunity to sell it. Android and other major mobile phone platforms followed this model with their smartphones later on, though to a lesser degree.It's not outrageous to think Jobs and Stanton spoke candidly about network matters, given Stanton's long history with wireless carriers. He was the first employee at McCaw Cellular, the national wireless provider that later became AT&T Wireless. He started another firm called Western Wireless, which birthed an operator called Voicestream that was bought out by Deutsche Telekom and became T-Mobile.I'd be interested to find out what sort of challenges Apple encountered trying to develop and get a phone to work properly just on the WiFi spectrum. The company certainly could have just bought out an existing carrier with its billions in the bank. Either option must have been too costly or provided too little pay-off to make it worthwhile.

AT&T has apparently found a workable solution to the reported data congestion in New York City. They’ve quietly stopped selling the iPhone from their web site to customers in the New York metropolitan area.I guess that’s one way to solve the problem.Reader Stephen in Brooklyn made the discovery while shopping for a new phone today.I was on the AT&T Wireless website trying to get an iPhone. However, when I put in my zip code 11231, the site says the iPhone is unavailable. This seemed a little odd so I started punching in other famous zip codes: 90210, 60609 (spiegel catalog), 02134 (zoom, an old children’s show). For theses cities, LA, Chicago, Boston, iPhone is available. Then I looked up some other zip codes: Dallas, Miami, St. Louis, Philadelphia, San Francisco. All those cities are ok. Then I started putting in more NYC zip codes: midtown, Staten Island, the Bronx…no iPhone available. This is weird…AT&T has cut off New York City.I went to the AT&T site to verify what Stephen said. Sure enough, the iPhone was available to zip codes in San Francisco and other major cities. It was not available to purchase for people living anywhere in New York City, or any of the suburban zip codes in Westchester County or northern New Jersey that I tried. Was it a web site bug? I hopped online with a customer service chat rep to check.Daphne: Welcome to AT&T online Sales support. How may I assist you with placing your order today? Laura: Hi, I was looking at the iPhone 3Gs and the system tells me that I cannot order one in my ZIP code. My zip code is 11231. (Brooklyn, NY) Is this true? Are iPhones no longer available in New York City? Daphne: I am happy to be helping you today . Yes, this is correct the phone is not offered to you because New York is not ready for the iPhone. Daphne: You don’t have enough towers to handle the phone. Laura: Thank you for your help. So the phone is not available to people anywhere in the city? Daphne: Yes this is correct Laura.The iPhone is still available in Apple ant AT&T stores in and around New York CIty. Just not online. Why?Update 1: In a written statement, AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook told Consumerist that “We periodically modify our promotions and distribution channels.” We have requested additional details, and will add them when and if they become available.Update 2 (12/28/09): New York customers are now able to order iPhones via AT&T’s Web site. It would appear that the company has once more modified its “promotions and distribution channels.” We’ve requested a statement from AT&T, and will update this post it if and when we receive it.Is the iPhone available for sale where you live, online or in stores? Let us know in the comments, or e-mail tips@consumerist.com.RELATED: AT&T Network Struggling In iPhone-Dense Urban Areas Call Drop Rate For iPhones In NYC Is 30%, Says Apple Genius Why Do iPhone Owners Hate AT&T So Much?

Xbox SmartGlass for Android and iPhone will be coming in early 2013, Microsoft has told us, following a demo of the innovative service on Windows 8. SmartGlass was first demonstrated back at E3 in June 2012.Xbox SmartGlass will give you expanded control and integration with your Xbox 360 from your smart device. It's going to be available across Microsoft's platforms (Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT) from launch, before landing on other platforms in early 2013.UPDATE: It looks like the Android app has already arrived, you can read about it here.SmartGlass will give you the ability to use your phone as a controller as long as you are on the same network as your console, a function already available through the My Xbox Live companion app on iPhone (pictured above).Although Microsoft is yet to show SmartGlass on all these platforms, we do have some screens from Xbox SmartGlass for Android, iPhone and iPad in the gallery below. We've included a screen from the Android and iPhone apps just below, so you know what to expect.SmartGlass will allow control over movies and music, moving playback from one device to another, so you can pause on your tablet and resume on your Xbox, back on the big screen. It will also allow your mobile device to act as a second screen for things like movies and music, providing information on actors or artists.This second-screen experience extends to supported games: for example, it will provide a GPS map for Forza Horizon or let you line up the next track for Dance Central 3, we have been told.It will act as a remote for the new Xbox Internet Explorer browser, so you can zoom using pinch on your display.Xbox SmartGlass will be available in Windows 8, which launches on 26 October and Windows Phone 8, launching 29 October, initially. You will need an Xbox Live Gold subscription for some SmartGlass features to work and we're not certain exactly which features Android and iOS users will get.Once we've got firm dates for SmartGlass on other platforms, we'll bring you all the details.

Reddit, owned by Conde Nast (who also happens to own Ars Technica and Wired.com), is one of the popular social news website on the internet. So, if you are an avowed lurker at Reddit, like me, then an app for your iOS device can be helpful to budge through the popular /r sections wherever you go.iReddit is the official Reddit app for the iPhone, iPad and the iPod touch, and is fairly good at what it does. However, the frequent crashes, freezing, and no support for the app can be disappointing. Perhaps, that’s where the unofficial Reddit app comes into play.The app is “Alien blue,” which is free to download and works with the 3.x and the new iOS 4.0+ firmware. What makes this app better than the official is, of course, the easy to use interface and navigation available at the tap of a button. The main page is nifty, well organized with theme selection feature and added support for multiple user login is enough to jolt the Redditors.Alien blue app lets you select different themes by changing the appearance, allows you to tweak the settings, upvote (umm… downvote) posts and edit the comments. In short: Alien blue culminates into an impressive app that turns out to be much better than the iReddit.So, if you are intrigued by this short review, then check out the app (I am not affiliated with Alien blue) by visiting the iTunes page, or searching for “Alien blue” right from your Apple device. Yes, they do have a Pro version, but the free one does the job, actually a very good job!Edit: Thanks for the love, Reddit! And yes, for those of you who are using iPad, Alien blue isn’t free to download, but it is totally worth it ($1.99).

The Quip app promised to let people send pictures to each other for free — like sending a multimedia message but without any fees.What it didn't say was that anyone with a few web skills could see them as well.Quip stored the private images on a publicly accessible web server without any encryption, making them easy prey for savvy internet users.Now some of the most intimate moments of thousands of people are being circulated on web forums.Many photos show people posing nude or having sex. Others show a day at the baseball or baby shots.One image shows a man naked from the waist up and seemingly covered in cuts and blood. Another seems to have been taken inside the White House.Some internet users have also allegedly matched up nude photos with real names and Facebook profiles.On one web forum, a user identifying as one of the makers of the Quip app said the system had been shut down."Hello, this is Ish, the founder of Addy Mobile, makers of the Quip app," said "ish_addy" on Reddit."As soon as this post came to our attention, we immediately shut down our servers. We have also now disabled all S3 access and have started to systematically secure all files in the system."We will not bring the system back up until we have adequate security around all files shared over Quip."However many of the photos, saved by people before the servers were shut down, are still being circulated.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs is on a roll. While heâ€™s probably had better days than today, heâ€™s lately been shooting off emails left and right in response to customersâ€™ concerns. We just were sent what appears to be one such Jobs response, sent last week surrounding the whole Mark Fiore situation. And itâ€™s a good one.When questioned about Appleâ€™s role as moral police in the App Store, Jobs responds that â€œwe do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone.â€? Better, is what he said next: â€œFolks who want porn can buy and [sic] Android phone.â€œLast week, another Jobs email about the Fiore situation was published in which Jobs called the situation a â€œmistake.â€? He noted the same thing in this email, but the porn/Android link is the key here. Assuming this email is legit, this isnâ€™t the first time Jobs has suggested users try Android if they want porn. Earlier this month, during a Q&A session after the iPhone 4.0 OS event, Jobs said: You know, thereâ€™s a porn store for Android. You can download nothing but porn. You can download porn, your kids can download porn. Thatâ€™s a place we donâ€™t want to go â€“ so weâ€™re not going to go there.This is noteworthy both because itâ€™s funny, and because Apple and Google are in the early stages of a war thatâ€™s brewing between the iPhone and Googleâ€™s Android platform. Jobs is apparently going to keep taking these jabs from what he considers to be the moral high-ground.Read the full back-and-forth below:Matthew Browing, an Apple customer wrote the following to Jobs: I was converted to Apple products with the announcement of the iPhone 3G. (My friends have been trying to convince me for years.) Since then Iâ€™ve purchased 4 iPhones, 2 computers, several routers, and miscellaneous other items. Unfortunately, Iâ€™m really starting to have a philosophical issue with your company. It appears that more and more Apple is determining for itâ€™s consumers what content they should be able to receive. For instance, the blocking of Mark Fioreâ€™s comic app (due to being political satire) or blocking of what Apple considers to be porn.Iâ€™m all for keeping porn out of kids hands. Heck â€“ Iâ€™m all for ensuring that I donâ€™t have to see it unless I want to. Butâ€¦ thatâ€™s what parental controls are for. Put these types of apps into categories and allow them to be blocked by their parents should they want to.Appleâ€™s role isnâ€™t moral police â€“ Appleâ€™s role is to design and produce really cool gadgets that do what the consumer wants them to do. Thanks for listening.In response, Jobs replied: Fioreâ€™s app will be in the store shortly. That was a mistake. However, we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone. Folks who want porn can buy and Android phone.Yes, Jobs apparently made a typo (and -> an), but we checked the IP headers on the email and they are legit. Of course, these can be faked, but it seems hard to believe that someone would go to all the work of sending us an email in which they changed all the IPs or manipulated all the time elements only to attach their real name and real email address to send it to us.And no, the email doesnâ€™t end with the usual â€œsent from my iPhoneâ€? or the new favorite, â€œsent from my iPad,â€? but again, looking at the header information, thatâ€™s because it was sent using Apple Mail. Jobs has been known to do this in the past (and recently) as well.

News of a successful attack that almost instantly gives full access to an iPhone's password keychain made its way around the Web on Thursday after Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology revealed the exploit to IDG News Service. While the fact that hackers could access a device's keychain in such a short time certainly sounds alarming, the attack isn't entirely new, and is actually a product of Apple's "DRM approach" to security, one iOS security expert told Ars.Fraunhofer SIT's exploit first relies on physical access to an iPhone, so an attacker has to get your iPhone away from you before digging in. In most cases like this, you would likely want to use Apple's (now free) remote wipe feature in order to protect your data, but remote wipe is easily thwarted by removing the device's SIM card. Any attacker sophisticated enough to decrypt the keychain will know this trick.Once an attacker has your phone, he could use any of the commonly available jailbreaks to install an SSH server, install a keychain hacking script, and collect the decrypted password information.Part of what makes the attack relatively trivial is that the cryptographic key used for the keychain is stored on the iPhone. Once a device is jailbroken, hackers can use iOS's built-in APIs to access and decrypt certain passwords—including those for network access and e-mail accounts—stored in the keychain. From there, passwords from VPN access or e-mail accounts can be further used to gain more passwords, or e-mail accounts can be used to request password resets for a number of online services.But while Fraunhofer SIT's particular methods may be new, accessing the keychain and other encrypted information on a jailbroken iPhone has been possible for some time. iPhone forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski told Ars that similar exploits have been around since about the time of the introduction of the iPhone 3G."Several dev teams have been able to easily deduce Apple's encryption keys for the keychain; it just hasn't been widely advertised," Zdziarski said. The "new" part of Fraunhofer SIT's attack, however, leverages Apple's APIs to access the keychain instead of other methods.The real problem, according to Zdziarski, is that Apple hasn't yet fully implemented a truly secure environment for iOS. "Apple has—since introducing encryption—been relying on their DRM know-how, and just erasing the label that says 'DRM' and calling it 'security,'" he explained. "The problem with this is that DRM only makes things a little more difficult for hackers.""Real security relies on the strength of the key, and the secrecy of the key," Zdziarski continued. "And as long as the keys are all stored on the iPhone and don't rely on a user password, they can easily be compromised."In other words, even while Apple has continually improved the security of information on iPhones and other iDevices, the same types of flaws that enable moderately skilled hackers to access an entire unencrypted disk image of an iPhone still exist. And while Apple offers APIs for developers to add an additional layer of encryption for user data, it's up to developers to implement it independently.Zdziarski said that he believes Apple is pushing to make the iPhone compliant with security standards set forth in Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). When that happens, government and enterprise users can be less wary about iPhone security issues. "But at the end of the day," he said, "Apple will need to abandon their DRM approach if they want true security, as opposed to just some fancy marketing strategies."

An iPhone bug already seen when Australia switched between Daylight Savings Time and Standard Time a few weeks ago has now hit Europe. Twitter just lit up with reports of recurring iPhone alarms going off an hour later than usual. So even though the iOS clock changed correctly over the weekend, the alarm did not. Thing is, according to a ZDNet Australia report from more than three weeks ago, Apple acknowledged the bug with a promise to fix it with a software update. So why wasn't it rolled out in time to avoid this mess in Europe? Let's see if Apple fixes it before North America makes the switch on November 7th, otherwise, you've been warned.Deleting and re-adding the alarms will NOT fix the issue. We've now tested a number of scenarios under iOS 4.1 on European iPhone 4 and 3GS devices for ourselves. The bug (demoed on video after the break by Roman ) appears when using a repeating alarm for anything other than "every day." So for example, your alarm will go off an hour late if it's set for "weekdays," or "weekends," or every "Monday." The following alarms are not affected by the bug: You can test yourself by creating a repeating alarm (but not every day) to go off one minute in the future and 59 minutes in the past.: Some US readers are now waking up to alarms reportedly going off an hour early [Thanks, David O. and Matthieu Di B.]

Sizes go up, prices fall. These are the two hallmark rules of the TV land. Just a few years ago, $800 couldn’t buy you a screen much larger ... Read moreMost folks have accepted that they'll buy new cases almost every time they upgrade their iPhones, thanks to subtle — and occasionally rather bold — design changes. But repurchasing all their accessories, including charger cables and speaker docks? That is a tougher, pricier pill to swallow.According to TechCrunch's John Biggs, we should get our credit cards ready as that shopping spree is inevitable. At the very least you'll be looking at buying an extra cable or two (currently priced at $19) and, unless there are some third-party adapters out there to ease the pain, you may also have to kiss your current speaker dock goodbye.Biggs writes that "three independent manufacturers" told him that the next-generation iPhone will use a 19-pin port, rather than the wider 30-pin port found on current iPhones, iPads and iPods. If true, this news will make life a bit difficult for third-party accessory manufacturers, who have accepted Apple's 30-pin port design as a standard "since Apple released the third-generation iPod" in 2003, writes Biggs.As skeptical as I normally am regarding reports like this one, it's actually not all that unlikely that Apple would redesign the iPhone — and subsequently iPod and iPad — ports. The 19-pin design would save valuable space, after all, and interface technology has made major advancements in 10 years.Let's not forget, the Cupertino-based company recently redesigned the MagSafe, its proprietary magnetically-attached power connector, too, and that was only around since 2006.Want more tech news, silly puns, or amusing links?

Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota) has called upon Apple and Google to participate in a hearing with the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law in order to discuss consumer privacy. The hearing will take place May 10 at 10 a.m. EDT in Washington, where witnesses from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, Center for Democracy and Technology and others will talk about what the latest mobile technology means for privacy and the law.“Recent advances in mobile technology have allowed Americans to stay connected like never before and put an astonishing number of resources at our fingertips,” Franken said in a statement. “But the same technology that has given us smartphones, tablets and cell phones has also allowed these devices to gather extremely sensitive information about users, including detailed records of their daily movements and location. This hearing is the first step in making certain that federal laws protecting consumers’ privacy — particularly when it comes to mobile devices — keep pace with advances in technology.”Device privacy has been an increasingly important topic to lawmakers in recent years, but discussion came to a head last week when two researchers revealed that the iPhone and 3G iPad keep a log file of every location the user has ever been, whether the iOS Location Services are turned on or not. The discovery was neither new nor hidden (and it turns out Google also does some level of location logging as well), but the announcement sparked a deeper look into how technology companies track and store our personal data.Franken was the first to fire off a letter to Apple over the news, followed by Representative Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts). Both demanded answers about why Apple collects the data, how it’s generated, whether users can disable the location logging and so on.Neither Apple nor Google have publicly acknowledged Franken’s call for a hearing just yet, and the companies did not respond to our request for comment by publication time. It’s in both of the companies’ better interest to attend, though, lest they want the DOJ, FTC, CDT and others to begin making plans for possible legislation without them.Photo: An unencrypted file stored in iPhones and iPads constantly records a user’s location data. An open source application was used to plot the location data from an iPhone belonging to a Wired.com reporter.

The iPhone has been hacked in the past to use modified external keyboards, but new mods promise much more general interaction. Now, iPhone expert Ralf Ackermann has succeeded in supporting a standard Bluetooth keyboard using an external Bluetooth approach and is working on supporting an internal one.For the external approach, Ackermann modified a Robotech Bluetooth module, which he placed in an iPhone battery sleeve and connected to the iPhone (serial) connector port at the bottom of the unit. This allowed the the phone to communicate directly with the the module using the Bluetooth serial port profile.The whole thing works courtesy of Jay "saurik" Freeman's Veency application. Ackermann used a tiny libvncclient to generate keyboard events, which were then passed to Veency. Veency then provided the keyboard event injection using the iPhone's private Graphics Services framework.You can find out more about this external module project over at Ackermann's blog. He'll be posting schematics and code as he gets his site set up.Ars readers may be more excited, though, by his work on a completely internal solution. Here, Ackermann discovered BlueSn0w, part of the iBluetooth project. BlueSn0w (yes, its name is apparently inspired by the iPhone dev team's yellowsn0w) will scan for discoverable Bluetooth devices. According to this Flickr page, the module seems to enable the Bluetooth UART interface to communicateThe internal solution depends on gaining access to the Bluetooth module stack. "User space BT stacks are not common—nevertheless, of course they can be done," Ackermann told Ars. "In the past, I had a look at an adaptation of the Linux Bluez stack for ATMEL uCs for instance—and this seems similar." Once the stack becomes available, Ackermann believes a fully internal solution will be quickly usable. There is no time estimate on this due to the complete volunteer nature of the BlueSn0w project but it looks like hobbyists are drawing close to the goal.Allowing the iPhone to accept keyboard input from an external Bluetooth keyboard will move the iPhone forward in opening new opportunities for general computing and on-the-go note taking. Taking into account the iPhone's newly realized video out support, the entire platform looks like it's at the brink of a transformative revolution.

After nearly a decade of rumors and speculation, Apple's finally unveiled the iPad. It's a half-inch thick and weighs just 1.5 pounds, with a 9.7-inch capacitive touchscreen IPS LCD display, and it's running a custom 1GHz Apple "A4" chip developed by the P.A. Semi team, with a 10-hour battery life and a month of standby. It'll come in 16, 32, and 64GB sizes, and it's got the expected connectivity: very little. There's a 30-pin Dock connector, a speaker, a microphone, Bluetooth, 802.11n WiFi and optional 3G, as well as an accelerometer and a compass. There's also a keyboard dock , which connects underneath in the portrait orientation, support for up to 1024x768 VGA out and 480p composite out through new dock adapter cables, and a camera attachment kit that lets you import photos from your camera over USB or directly through an SD reader. The device is managed by iTunes, just like the iPhone -- you sync everything over to your Mac. As expected, it can run iPhone apps -- either pixel-for-pixel in a window, or pixel-doubled fullscreen -- but developers can also target the new screen size using the updated iPhone OS SDK, which is available today. The 3G version runs on AT&T and comes with new data plans : 250MB for $14.99 and an unlimited plan for $29.99 a month contract-free. Activations are handled on the iPad, so you can activate and cancel whenever you want. Every iPad is unlocked and comes with a GSM "micro-SIM," so you can use it abroad, but there aren't any international deals in place right now -- Steve says they'll be back "this summer" with news on that front. It starts at $499 for 16GB, 32GB for $599, and $699 64GB. Adding 3G costs a $130 per model, so the most expensive model (64GB / 3G) is $829. The WiFi-only model will ship in 60 days, and the 3G models will come in 90.

As more and more businesses are switching to Apple products, Jobs is trying to make the move on two of the biggest U.S banks to become iPhone supporters. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are considering whether to let employees use the Apple iPhone as an alternative to RIM’s Blackberry for corporate e-mail. The banks are currently testing software for the iPhone that is designed to make it secure enough for company messages. The tests are the latest sign that RIM may be losing its tight grip on the corporate smartphone market. Companies are experimenting with alternatives such as Apple’s iPhone or devices that use Google’s Android software. “People are delighted with their iPhones and Android phones and they want to use them for work,” said Roger Entner, head of telecom research at Nielsen Co. “The result is RIM now has real competition for corporate customers.”RIM is already losing out on the battle, losing 15 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading this year before today, while Apple had climbed 51 percent. Apple led by Jobs, reported last month that 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone, including Procter & Gamble Co., General Electric Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. is exploring whether to let works use Androids or iPhones for corporate e-mail.Currently Bank of America, which has about 284,000 employees and Citigroup, which has about 258,000 employees are deploying or testing the new smartphones out. The efforts are intended to widen the choice of devices employees can use, rather than replace the Blackberry. The trials at the two companies involve more than 1,000 employees, which typically takes four to six weeks, and will be followed by a pilot project before potentially wider implementation. Laura Hunter, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina- based Bank of America, declined to comment on any specific trials, adding that “we continuously evaluate new and innovative technologies.”Apple is taking steps to make its products more appealing to businesses and challenge the Blackberry, which won over Wall Street banks and corporations with is security and reliability. Apple is working to improve the iPhone’s security by strengthening encryption tools and adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with server computers that can wipeout or lock an iPhone if it’s lost. The company even enlisted computer-services provide Unisys Corp. to help it sell more devices to corporate customers. While both RIM and Apple’s share of the global mobile-phone market rose last quarter from a year earlier as more consumers upgraded to smartphones, Apple moved into fourth position, knocking RIM into fifth, according to research firm IDC. The popularity of Apple’s latest model, the iPhone 4, helped the company sell more handsets than its Canadian rival.What do you think of the iPhone moving to Corporate America?

If you didn't already think your smartphone knows too much about you, here's a handy reminder. A duo of UK researchers have uncovered a potentially worrying (and oddly enough, undocumented) feature in iOS 4 : it asks your iPhone to record your location constantly, then timestamps that data and records it for posterity. The trouble with this unsolicited location tracking is that the hidden file that holds the data -- consolidated.db -- is relatively easy to uncover and read, making any desktops you've backed your phone up to and the phone itself even bigger privacy dangers than they would usually be. Some extra digging revealed this behavior has been known about for a good while (see Courbis and Alex Levinson links below), though mostly by people involved in computer forensics. Additionally, restoring a backup or migrating to a new device keeps the data logging going, which the researchers point to as evidence that what's happening isn't accidental. See a couple of visualizations of the extracted results on video after the break. [Thanks, Tom]The original text of this article was updated to reflect that this was already a known issue, albeit in limited circles. The ability to easily visualize the data is new.

AT&T is raising the fees it charges buyers of the iPhone and other smartphones if they break their two-year contracts, while lowering them for "dumb" phones to better align the fees with their real costs.Starting June 1, smartphone buyers will have to pay $325 for breaking their contract, up from $175 currently. For buyers of regular phones, the fee is being decreased by $25 to $150.The early termination fee goes down for every month customers stay in their contract — by $10 for smart phones and $4 for regular phones. So if a smart phone contract is broken after two months, the termination fee is reduced by $20 to $305.The changes only apply to new contracts and renewals.AT&T charges customers $199 for the latest model of the iPhone, but pays Apple far more than that. AT&T makes the subsidy back through the customer's service fees over the two-year contract period. AT&T likely loses money for every customer that breaks a contract and pays a $175 termination fee, but may break even with the new, higher fee. A new iPhone model is expected to be announced next month.Meanwhile, simpler phones may cost AT&T only $125 to buy, meaning that a $175 termination fee is excessive.Following the same logic, Verizon Wireless doubled its smartphone termination fees in November, from $175 to $350. Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile still charge the same termination fees for all types of phones: $200. All three also pro-rate the fees for customers who leave later in their contracts.The Federal Communications Commission has questioned Verizon Wireless about the higher termination fees for smartphone users, but hasn't taken any action.The pro-rating of the fees came about after the carriers settled several class-action lawsuits by customers who found it unfair that they paid the full termination fee when breaking a contract after nearly two years.

Facebook's slick new camera app goes on strike if you don't give it access to your location. Here's why.Since Facebook released its new "Camera" mobile app yesterday, there's been speculation as to why the social network would buy Instagram and then release its own very similar app. There's been even more curiosity about why the new app has such an interest in where you are while using it.As users have noticed, the Camera app requires iOS' Location Services to be turned on so it can access your locally stored photos, and the app won't let you upload a shot if you simply deny it location access from the get-go.According to software developerJoshua Debner, who pinged BuzzFeed, about the behavior, the location services requirement is "an iOS limitation in order to be able to multiselect. Otherwise you would have had to pick one photo at a time..."That feature is what currently separates the Facebook Camera app from the photo uploading feature in Facebook's usual iPhone and iPad app. There you can only upload one shot at a time.iOS and Android app Gifboom uses the same API, and has its own explainer on the matter:In Facebook's case, the standalone Camera app can use that location information to let other users know where you were when you took the photo, but it isn't on by default.CNET's Bridget Carey received confirmation that you can use the app even if you're concerned by giving it access to your location. The work around: Just make sure that when you take photos with the iPhone camera, you've turned off location permissions. No GPS data is then attached to your photos. Then you can go into Facebook Camera and upload them location-free.iOS Location Services is turned on by default, but it can be disabled in the device settings, and users can choose which apps are allowed to access Location Settings. Also, while it will be little comfort to those truly paranoid about location privacy, users of the app can choose whether to share a photo's location data when posting it to Facebook.Updated at 5:24 p.m. PT to clarify how iOS handles location with additional background.

The iPhone continues to store location data even when location services are disabled, contrary to Apple’s previous claims.The Wall Street Journal did independent testing on an iPhone and found that even after turning off location services, the device was still collecting information on nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points.This discovery challenges some of Apple’s claims. As Wired.com reported last week, the company explained in a detailed letter last year that it deliberately collects geodata to store in a comprehensive location database to improve location services. In the letter, Apple noted that customers can disable location-data collection by turning off Location Services in the settings menu.“If customers toggle the switch to ‘Off,’ they may not use location-based services, and no location-based information will be collected,” Apple said in the letter (.pdf).That doesn’t appear to be the case from WSJ‘s testing, as well as multiple independent reports from customers who had the same results.The controversy surrounding Apple’s location-tracking stems from a discovery by two data scientists, who found that a file stored on iPhones and iPads (“consolidated.db”) contains a detailed history of geodata accompanied with time stamps.Apple claimed in its letter last year that the geodata is stored on the device, then anonymized and transmitted back to Apple every 12 hours, using a secure Wi-Fi connection (if one is available).Although it’s thorough, Apple’s explanation does not address why the stored geodata continues to live on the device permanently after it’s transmitted to Apple, nor does it address why geodata collection appears to persist even when Location Services is turned off.Google does similar geodata collection for its own location-services database. However, it notifies Android users clearly in a prompt when geodata collection will occur, and it also gives users a way to opt out. Also, Android devices do not permanently store geodata after transmitting it to Google.Meanwhile, a MacRumors.com reader claims he sent an e-mail to CEO Steve Jobs asking him to explain why Apple tracks geodata, threatening to switch to an Android device.“Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a Droid,” the reader wrote. “They don’t track me.”The CEO shot back a terse reply, defending his company and attacking his competitor Google, according to the reader: “Oh yes they do. We don’t track anyone. The info circulating around is false.”Apple has not commented on the authenticity of the e-mail.The purported e-mail is similar in nature to many e-mails that Jobs has sent to customers in the past: It’s concise and still manages to pull off some word play. Jobs would be accurate to claim that Apple is not tracking customers directly — but instead it is using iPhones to gather information about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi stations, occasionally combined with GPS data. In other words, Apple is tracking geodata from mobile devices, as Google is also doing.Apple has not commented on the location-tracking issue since the story broke last week.While the collected geodata doesn’t reveal specific addresses for locations you’ve visited, it can still leave a pretty rich trail of a user’s movements. Combine this data with other pieces of information on the iPhone, like your messages and photos, and you’ve got a device that knows more about you than you do yourself, says The Atlantic‘s Alexis Madrigal.Madrigal tested an iPhone forensics program called Lantern, which stitches together contacts, text messages and geodata into a neat interface that reconstructed a timeline of his life.“Immediately after trying out Lantern, I enabled the iPhone’s passcode and set it to erase all data on the phone,” Madrigal said. “This thing remembers more about where I’ve been and what I’ve said than I do, and I’m damn sure I don’t want it falling into anyone’s hands.”

Thomas Suarez is in the 6th grade at a middle school in the South Bay. And while most of his peers are probably fussing over new soccer kleets or watching the Disney channel, he’s creating iOS apps and giving TED Talks.Suarez, who’s not even old enough to have a Facebook account, has been fascinated by computers and technology since before kindergarten. He’s established his own company, CarrotCorp and has made two iOS apps that are currently in the App Store: Earth Fortune, which displays different colors of Earth depending on what your fortune is and his most successful- Bustin Jieber, a Whac-a-Mole for Justin Bieber.“A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them,” he says. “And it’s difficult because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program…And not many parents have written apps.” Suarez, inspired by Steve Jobs, started an App Club at school where any student can come to learn to design an app. In the future, Suarez wants to create more apps, more games and get into Android programming and development. He plans on continuing his app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.Knowing that human beings such as Suarez exist makes me really hopeful and excited for the future.

Have you tried Google’s new voice-enabled search application for the iPhone yet? No, and neither have we. Amidst the big launch on Friday, and the corresponding ballyhoo in The New York Times, one thing was forgotten: the application itself. Apple didn’t get around to actually putting it in the App Store.As of now (Monday morning in Europe), only the old, non-voice version is available at the store. According to Michael Arrington at Tech Crunch, Google is subject to the same arbitrary application approval scheme as everyone else. The search company fully expected Google Mobile App to go live on Friday, but nothing showed up. The only indication of the app’s status was the message displayed in the iPhone Developer Tools which read "In Review".Arrington paints Google as the wounded party in his piece. Here’s what he says about Google launching first on the iPhone, and not on its own Android platform: The fact that they decided to launch first on the iPhone shows a willingness to embrace what’s right for the user.We doubt it. The fact is that next to nobody has the T-Mobile G1, and more than 10 million people have an iPhone. Still, Apple needs to sort out the App Store, and quick. It’s clearly a broken model, and the only person hurt is the iPhone user.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple's new iPhone doesn't seem to like being touched much, and the beautiful (if easily discoloured) screen scratches too. Dear dear.To be fair, the scratching issue only affects the more-clumsy user, and there are only a couple of reports about discolouration in the corner of the screen, but it seems that the majority of iPhone 4s do have an aversion to being touched as sticky fingers are causing huge drops in signal strength.The problem was first noted by a reader on the MacRumors forum who provided a demonstration video:Since then tech blog Gizmodo has been canvassing early-adopters and accumulated a bundle of examples showing, in almost every case, that touching the bottom of the phone leads to around three bars being dropped off the indicated signal strength (which runs up to five).Even worse, a speed test performed by one reader demonstrated the download connection dropped to less than a third (from 840Kb/sec to 263Kb/sec) when they picked up the phone, a drop which could be slightly mitigated through the use of a leather case.Which brings us to the conspiracy part of the story – unlike previous iPhones, the latest model was launched along with accessories including the "bump case", which (it appears) would provide enough separation to improve the signal significantly. A deliberate plan by Apple seems a stretch to us, but it's hard to see how such a widespread problem got missed during development.Radio modelling can get very complicated, and the plethora of radios and frequencies used by a modern mobile phone adds to that complexity. In the past companies such as Nokia were able to leverage their vast experience with radio to create phones that just worked better than the competition. More recently the commoditisation of the radio component has enabled lots more players to create acceptable kit, though it seems in this case Apple may have tripped up.A few users may be seeing discolouration in the corners of their iPhone 4 screens (as reported by CNet), and some will manage to scratch them too (also reported by CNet), but the killer application for a mobile phone remains the ability to make phone calls, and it seems possible that in all the excitement Apple has forgotten that. ®

The latest report on the proposed iPhone software development kit would suggest that Apple is planning a restrictive policy for application development.iLounge reported Friday that the iPhone SDK will come along with restrictions on what kinds of iPhone and iPod Touch applications can be developed, where they can be sold, and what types of peripheral devices they can access. While not a shock, if true that type of policy will not please software developers who were hoping for more open access to the iPhone.If true, Apple's iPhone application policy isn't going to please the development community.(Credit: CNET Networks)The specifics? Apple would apparently mandate that all iPhone or iPod Touch applications be sold through the iTunes Store. That's not too surprising, since the iTunes software is the primary vehicle for getting software updates and contacts onto or off of the iPhone. And the visibility of the iTunes Store would be a boon to smaller developers trying to get noticed.Secondly, the report says Apple will deny developers access to the iPhone or iPod Touch dock, meaning their software would be unable to talk to third-party peripherals like keyboards or audio equipment. The applications could use the basic functions of the iPhone, such as the phone, Wi-Fi, and camera, according to the report, but that keeps developers inside a relatively small box.The detail that will generate the most angst and frustration, however, would be Apple's apparent plan to serve as the clearing house for all proposed applications. The company would retain veto power over the number and types of applications that could be installed on an iPhone, meaning no application could be officially released without a thumbs-up from an Apple committee or executive.If true, this policy would fall heavily to the "restrictive" side of the application-development spectrum outlined we outlined earlier this week. Apple plans to reveal the actual details at an event in Cupertino next Thursday.UPDATED 3:40pm - Electronista is now reporting that the restrictions might only apply to paid applications, and that free applications destined for the iPhone or the iPod Touch would not be subject to the same kinds of limits. This would be very helpful for extremely small developers or homegrown application development inside companies, but would still mean Apple plans to control the marketplace for iPhone applications.

In light of the recent update in the developer's agreement for the iPhone, countless discussions have appeared on the internet which follow the same beaten path of such conversations.Namely, they boil down to somebody saying someting along these lines:"It's Steve Job's company, and he has every right to do whatever he wants with it. He sets up the rules. If you don't like the rules, don't buy his products, don't bitch about it on the forums".This point is incorrect for many reasons, one of them being that if you don't like people bitching about anything, you are just as free to not read it. However, that's not the reason I am going to talk about. The reason I will talk about is this:*Doing so does not make sense from an economic point of view. *All these assumptions are false. First of all, it is rarely the case that there exists a product on the market that has all the feature any particular customer wants. For that matter, one can desire a product that, in fact, is an iPhone with feature X on it.Secondly, the argument assumes that one can just go and buy a new piece of technology at any time, even if there is a product that satisfies the requirements. Not all people have the budget to switch. Some are tied by other factors (e.g. people who actually want an iPhone might be deterred by AT&T). Some people purhcased a product before a better one appeared on the market.Thirdly, simply buying a competitor's product doesn't work if only a minority of its users are not satisfied. As long as the decrease in the influx of customers is a smaller loss than the cost of adding a feature (think Fight Club!).More importantly, a person who bought an iPhone, didn't like it and switched is not a loss for Apple if the said person is silent about it. This brings us to the fourth point: that's exactly what Apple would want you to do: they would rather lose customers than have complaining customers. This is why the phones are locked and the App store is insanely restrictive, in spite of potential loss of customers that it brings.So, as a consumer who is unhappy about X on the iPhone, what are you to do?You are to bitch about it, loudly and publicly. You are to scream in all forums about how X makes your life miserable, and how iPhone is not good without X. You are to say that you are going to switch to an Android phone next month because X on the iPhone makes it unusable for everybody. Make a "Top 5 reasons why you shouldn't own an iPhone" on your blog ("Top 10" if you own one), with X being the No. 1 reason.In short, you are to make a person about to buy an iPhone reconsider doing it because of X.So, you are to make some bad publicity for Apple. Bad publicity is always a loss for a company, and it's a loss that is noticeable to shareholders. In this day and age, even a blog post can go far. And if you scare the shareholders, even Steve Jobs will have to abide. And if Apple still keeps its course in spite of your efforts, you still win by strengthening the competition, who (if smart) might even make a product for you that is good and has X.tl;dr: if you want a feature X on a platform, bitching about X en masse is an effective way to hurt the company just enough for it to provide X for you. So, Bitching is a good negative reinforcement.

The battle between Samsung and Apple rages on, but this time, it’s Samsung coming out on top. For the month of August, the top-selling phone at three of the four big U.S. carriers was Samsung’s new Galaxy S III smartphone, according to Apple Insider. The data came from carrier store checks by analyst Michael Walkley with Canaccord Genuity and mark the first time since launch that the iPhone 4S wasn’t the top handset.This news follows the more than 1 billion in damages that Samsung may have to pay Apple due to various patent infringements from prior Samsung smartphones. It’s not likely to offset that much of any such damages, and it’s even less likely that this trend will continue for Samsung: Apple today announced a press event on Sept. 12 where it is expected to launch the iPhone 5.Indeed part of Samsung’s success with the Galaxy S III is due to consumers waiting for the next iPhone; those that already know that an Apple smartphone is their preference could be holding off on a phone purchase. But Samsung should still be happy with the sales “win” for August as it shows that new and upgrading customers are interested in the Galaxy S III. And why not? In my June review, I considered it “the defining Android phone.”This situation could also help explain why Samsung didn’t follow the same launch strategy from the Galaxy S II last year. That handset was announced in May, but took until November to finally appear on all four major U.S. carriers. With the Galaxy S III debuting across the U.S. in June — just one month after the phone’s introduction — Samsung got a jump on sales prior to any new Apple hardware, with 10 million sales in the first month.Again, Samsung is unlikely to hold its sales lead against Apple when the new iPhone arrives, but it will be interesting to see what happens a few months later. Could the Galaxy S III again take the top spot away from the next iPhone at Verizon, AT&T or Sprint? I think it’s possible, especially once Samsung releases the Android 4.1 update for the Galaxy S III, which adds the proactive Google Now personal assistant and performance boost in the latest version of Android.Regardless of how the next few months play out between these two phones, the situation is a good reminder of how few others are competing against Apple in the smartphone market. Motorola, HTC, LG and others are simply hanging on at this point while Samsung is taking the Android charge against iOS.

The Michigan man behind a massive iPod repair and return scam will soon be thinking about his actions in a jail cell. Twenty-three-year-old Nicholas Woodhams, also known as the "iPod Mechanic," was sentenced to 13 months in prison this week after pleading guilty to mail fraud and money laundering charges earlier this year. In addition to jail time, Woodhams was ordered to pay $648,568 in restitution to Apple as well as $8,066.85 to the US Postal Service, according to the US Attorney General's Office.Apple filed a lawsuit against Woodhams in July of 2008 for defrauding the company out of numerous iPod shuffles and other iPod repairs. The company accused Woodhams of exploiting Apple's advance replacement system for the iPod shuffle, reselling the new devices through his own website. Additionally, Woodhams exploited Apple's iPod Warranty Service Program to get repairs on iPods that were out of warranty. Less than a year later, prosecutors in Michigan filed criminal charges against Woodhams, alleging that he committed fraud and laundered money as a part of his scam.In April of this year, Woodhams must have been scared enough to try and come up with a plea bargain, admitting that he was guilty for the criminal charges. That brings us to where we are today: Woodhams was sentenced by US District Judge Robert Holmes Bell to prison time plus restitution on Tuesday of this week. In addition to all of the above, Woodhams was also forced to forfeit about $750,000 worth of ill-gotten gains, including a house in Michigan, an Audi S4, an Ariel Atom 2, a Honda motorcycle, and more than half a million dollars in cold, hard cash.For those keeping track, that's a grand total of about $1,406,634.85 (or so) that Woodhams will be forking over to everyone involved. For someone who is only 23, that's a hefty price to pay for what originated as an easy way to make a buck on the Internet.

Motorola and Verizon invited comparisons, and that's what they gotThe Droid lands in stores Friday, and on Thursday the heavyweight reviewers -- which is to say the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg and the New York Times' David Pogue -- weighed in.Given that Motorola (MOT) and Verizon (VZ) pitched the Droid in its first TV ad as everything Apple's (AAPL) and AT&T's (T) iPhone was not, it was perhaps inevitable that every reviewer so far, including these two, treated its arrival as a grudge match.Mossberg's review is positive but tepid -- especially the video version. He plods through the comparisons item by item like a slightly boring homework assignment. His top-line summary:"While it has some significant drawbacks, I regard it as a success overall. It's the best super-smart phone Verizon offers, the best Motorola phone I've tested and the best hardware so far to run [Google's (GOOG)] Android. I can recommend the Droid to Verizon loyalists who have lusted for a better smart phone, but don't want to switch networks." (link)Pogue being Pogue has more fun with the assignment, even running a Twitter contest to come up with a new term for these newfangled gizmos. (He's going with "app phones"; Mossberg calls them "super-smart phones.") Pogue's bottom line:Since Verizon seems to want a Droid-iPhone faceoff, here it is: the Droid wins on phone network, customizability, GPS navigation, speaker, physical keyboard, removable battery and openness (free operating system, mostly uncensored app store). The iPhone wins on simplicity, refinement, thinness, design, Web browsing, music/video synching with your computer, accessory ecosystem and quality/quantity of the app store." (link)For a more thorough comparison, written by someone who actually seems to care, check out developer Greg Kumparak's 2,500 word review in TechCrunch. His conclusion: "At this point, I honestly feel that either choice would make any sane person incredibly happy."

The Samsung Galaxy S3 is outselling the iPhone 5 despite Apple's hugely hyped launch, according to new figures.Comparison site uSwitch says the S3 outsold the iPhone on deals from British phone networks in September, but the figures don't include any phones sold SIM-free. Despite the huge hype around its launch, the iPhone 5 arrives at -- appropriately enough -- number five with a bullet on the uSwitch hotlist.Although the iPhone went on sale in shops on 21 September, it was available to order online from the 14th. While that means it was on sale for less time than other phones, the first few days often see the fastest sales, like the opening weekend of a movie. As queues formed outside Apple Stores days in advance, the iPhone 5 ended up shifting 5 million phones globally in the first three days -- beating the previous model's first month of sales. So we'd expect the iPhone to have a stellar fortnight.By contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S3 has been on sale since May, so you'd expect sales to have slowed, but with five months at the top is clearly still selling like heated comestibles. The iPhone was also outsold by the Samsung Galaxy Ace and the older Galaxy S2, and the iPhone 4S, showing that many phone fans would rather bag a bargain on an older phone than splash out on the latest iPhone.The Mobile Tracker report is based on figures derived from uSwitch and its network of mobile phone comparison partners, so doesn't include those buying unlocked iPhones direct from Apple -- or indeed any other SIM-free phone.If you're considering buying a new iPhone, check out our iPhone comparison guide to save oodles of boodle.Have you bought a new phone in the last month? Did you opt for a new phone or bag a bargain? Tell me your thoughts in the comments or on our Facebook page.

In late March, four US Senators banded together and wrote a letter to Apple asking that they remove apps that alert users as to the whereabouts of DUI checkpoints.“With more than 10,000 Americans dying in drunk-driving crashes every year,” the letter stated, “providing access to iPhone and iPad applications that alert users to DUI checkpoints is harmful to public safety. We know that your company shares our desire to end the scourge of drunk driving and we therefore would ask you to remove these applications from your store.”While some of these apps make use of information housed in publicly accessible databases, many of them rely on crowdsourcing. Indeed, one app singled out by the letter is alleged to have had approximately 10 million users actively alerting “each other to DUI checkpoints in real time.”In a separate letter sent concurrently by US Sentator Charles Schumer, Schumer also called out apps like Trapster and PhantomAlert which work to alert users as to the whereabouts of police speed traps and red light cameras.Well, Apple took those letters to heart, partially.In revised app store guidelines discovered by Mac Rumors, Apple has updated Section 22.8 to now read:So one out of two ain’t bad, and in all honesty, Apple made the right decision here.DUI checkpoint apps do nothing more than tell potentially intoxicated drivers where not to go. They’re still driving drunk, just on the down low. Apps like Trapster, however, might effectively work to cut down on speeding when a police speed trap is noted. Though to be fair, it might encourage speeders to pick their spots more strategically.Either way, drunk driving is a lot more serious and contentious than speeders which is probably why Apple chose to only address DUI checkpoint apps.We should note, however, that DUI checkpoint apps already on the iTunes App Store haven’t been kicked out and we’ll have to wait and see if they’re grandfathered in or if they’ll eventually be removed. Take DUI Dodger, for example, which enables users to view and submit checkpoints in their area.

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

Following a huge week that saw Apple’s stock climb above $630 amid a fresh round of analyst upgrades, one analyst isn’t sold on the notion that smooth sailing is assured in the immediate future for the world’s most valuable company. BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk thinks Apple is set to report blowout earnings for the second fiscal quarter — he sees Apple earning $10.75 per share on sales of $40 billion in the quarter, versus Wall Street’s consensus of $9.81 and $36 billion — but he downgraded Apple’s stock to Neutral from Buy, noting that it’s time for investors to “take a breather.” Read on for more.“We continue to maintain our view that Apple is the primary beneficiary of an accelerating growth trend in the global adoption of smartphones, considering global penetration of smartphones has not yet even reached 30%,” Piecyk wrote in a research note on Monday. “However, given the run up in Apple’s stock and the consensus estimates, we think now is a good time to more carefully consider how it will capitalize on the next and likely much larger leg of growth in the industry and prepare for the inevitable bumps that may occur on the way.”The analyst believes Apple could run into some trouble starting in the third fiscal quarter that may eventually lead to a price cut on Apple’s iPhone, which currently drives much of Apple’s success due to huge margins. While numerous analysts see continued success for Apple’s highly sought-after smartphone, Piecyk believes carriers will soon grow less willing to sustain a $600 iPhone.“Subsidies by post-paid wireless operators have fueled the growth of Apple’s $600 iPhone since its inception” Piecyk wrote. “Even in the pre-paid dominant markets of China and Europe, heavily subsidized iPhone’s are available to users willing to sign up for a contract. Wireless operators have been happy to subsidize smartphones to new and existing customers in order to provide a lift to the average monthly bill (ARPU) of their customer base, a metric which had been falling for the past three decades.”The analyst continued, “The positive inflection point in ARPU was cheered by investors but the cost to drive that ARPU accretion is now starting to eat away at profitability and the performance of those stocks. Operators, unwilling to stall the pace of ARPU growth, offered generous upgrade policies including some that enabled a fully subsidized phone upgrade only one year in to a two year contract. We expect those policies to change as the faster upgrade rate of smartphones compared to legacy feature phones has been a costly surprise to post-paid and pre-paid operators, alike.”BTIG sees Apple selling 33 million iPhones in the second fiscal quarter and 27.5 million in the third, when it could miss Wall Street’s earnings estimates as it did in the fourth quarter last year. “Specifically, we expect Apple’s iPhone sales to drop to 27.5 million units in Fiscal Q3 resulting in a revenue estimate that is $1 billion below consensus,” Piecyk noted.

Apple rushed to file a last minute request with the court to stop Samsung from making public a series of sensitive sales data documents related to the iPhone and iPad when it cross examines Philip Schiller, Apple?s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, later today.The judge presiding over the patent case between Apple and Samsung has worked to keep the closely watched trial, and all related evidence, as transparently open as possible, but has allowed both parties to argue in support of sealing specific, confidential evidence on a case-by-case basis. In addition to sales and marketing data, Apple's various motions to keep evidence private and confidential have also included iOS source code, which the company holds to be particularly sensitive. Apple has most recently filed two motions related to eight confidential trial exhibits of sales data, which the company's attorneys described as "a particularized, document-by-document showing of good cause and compelling reasons for sealing of Apple?s most competitively sensitive information." The motions included "declarations from several of its executives attesting to the value of this information, the efforts Apple has undertaken to maintain its secrecy, and the harm that Apple would suffer if it were publicly disclosed." Apple stated that it had originally filed a motion last week to seal four documents Samsung had said it would use during Schiller's cross examination scheduled for today, but added four more after being notified last night after 9 PM by Samsung that it planned to use another four. The documents in question include iPhone, iPad and iPod touch sales summaries, an iPad tracking study, and a series of quarterly iPhone buyer surveys conducted over the past two years. Apple also objected to Samsung's last minute surprise notification of the additional documents it planned to present today, but asked the court that "only excerpted portions of those documents be entered into evidence" if it decided to allow the late filings. The iPhone maker has proposed using excerpted versions of various sales report and other documents it holds to be confidential, putting only a few specific, relevant pages of the hundreds of pages of the documents in question into evidence in a manner than would become part of the public record. Apple argued that this "would lessen the burdens on the jury and the Court and would balance the public interest in access to court records and Apple?s interest in maintaining secrecy of its valuable trade secrets," but noted that it was "unable to reach agreement" with Samsung on the matter. In response to Apple's motion, US District Court Judge Lucy Koh ordered that two exhibits on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch sales summaries would be sealed in part with the redactions Apple requested earlier in the week, and that only the relevant pages of two studies Samsung plans to question Schiller about will be entered into evidence. The additional four documents Samsung announced it would use today "shall not be used in the examination of Mr. Schiller as they were not timely disclosed," the judge wrote in her response to the motion.

Developing applications for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is big business, and it's one that Novell (NASDAQ: NOVL) wants a piece of. Novell today released new software called MonoTouch that aims to bring .NET applications to the iPhone.MonoTouch is based on Novell's Mono project, which is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework. Unlike Mono, MonoTouch is neither free nor open source and is being sold as a commercial product by Novell. With MonoTouch, Novell is expanding the developer base for iPhone applications beyond just C to include .NET and its millions of global developers.Miguel de Icaza, vice president for developer platforms at Novell, explained that MonoTouch is built from the same source code base as Mono, but there are some differences."Mono is a traditional .NET implementation with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler," De Icaza told InternetNews.com. "The iPhone has both a legal and technical limitation for interpreters in general, so we had to modify it."He added that MonoTouch includes a static compiler, which means that there are some dynamic things that developers are used to doing with .NET that they won't be able to do with MonoTouch. In particular, he noted that the add-on IronPython and IronRuby languages do not currently work with MonoTouch.De Icaza added that there is no magic porting tool for traditional .NET applications to run on MonoTouch for the iPhone. The reason is due to the dynamic compiler issues, which can affect software libraries.The 1.0 launch of MonoTouch follows a relatively rapid development cycle from De Icaza and his team. He said the first MonoTouch prototype was completed in early May, and the limited beta program opened up in August. According to De Icaza, there were 600 people in the beta program.With 1.0 now available, the plan is to continue to evolve MonoTouch and add new features over time. Among the features for the MonoTouch 2.0 roadmap is support for Microsoft's Silverlight media framework. Novell has an effort known as Moonlight that provides an open source implementation."MonoTouch is not an open source effort, although the foundation with Mono is," De Icaza said.He added that many of the pieces that are necessary for MonoTouch are not open source. Among those pieces are all the API bindings to the Apple platform. Novell has been working on Mono since 2004 as an open source implementation of the .NET framework. The most recent release is Mono 2.4, which provides performance improvements."MonoTouch is proprietary and I don't feel guilty about that," De Icaza said. "Mono is open source, but on the iPhone we felt that it's a proprietary platform, a very locked down platform and we felt if you're targeting that platform, we might as well make it proprietary as well."

This one’s nuts. Remember how there were no police reports about the missing iPhone 5 prototype, even though CNet reported that police offices had actually searched a man’s house looking for it? The guy whose home was searched in search of that lost iPhone 5 prototype says the officials weren’t actually police officers… they were Apple employees impersonating them.The implication is that the officials, who appear to be members of Apple’s security team, were impersonating police, a crime punishable by up to a year in jail in California.In July, an iPhone 5 prototype was purportedly lost in Cava 22, a San Francisco bar. Shortly after, the home of Sergio Calderón, 22, of Bernal Heights in San Francisco, was searched by six officials claiming to be police. They had traced the missing iPhone 5 prototype to his home using GPS.But now it appears that the six officials — four men and two women, all wearing badges of some kind — weren’t SFPD, but part of Apple’s security team. A phone number given to Calderón by one of the men who identified himself as “Tony,” belongs to Anthony Colon, a former San Jose Police sergeant who is employed as a “senior investigator” at Apple (LinkedIn profile).“This is something that’s going to need to be investigated now,” SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfield said, when informed about the Bernal Heights man’s statements to SF Weekly. “If this guy is saying that the people said they were SFPD, that’s a big deal.”The story of the lost prototype was reported by CNet earlier this week, citing an unnamed source. However, SFPD has no record of the case and when we visited the bar where the phone was supposedly lost, the manager knew nothing about it.Here’s a picture of Anthony Colon and a screenshot of his LinkedIn profile, which has now been removed:

In Russia, iPhone hacks you! Via 9to5Mac, it seems that a crafty Ruskie hacker who calls himself “ZonD80? has concocted a method that lets even novice hackers get free in-app purchases from the Apple App Store without even having to jailbreak their iPhone. 9to5Mac says that the hacker’s content-stealing method has three steps: “The installation of CA certificate, the installation of in-appstore.com certificate, and the changing DNS record in wi-fi settings.” Once all these steps are complete, the hacker’s in-appstore.com interface takes over and lets users grab content from the App Store without paying.UPDATE: Apple responded to the security flaw in a statement provided to The Loop. “The security of the App Store is incredibly important to us and the developer community,” an Apple spokeswoman said. “We take reports of fraudulent activity very seriously and we are investigating.”Amusingly, 9to5Mac also reports that ZonD80 is imploring users to “not pirate AppStore apps” even though his program is designed to do exactly that. 9to5Mac also issues a battle cry to iOS developers to help patch this apparent flaw in the App Store in order to make sure developers keep getting paid for their work. (As an editorial aside: Please don’t steal app developers’ content.)

One of our very close AT&T sources just sent us in these images. Yes, it’s a fried iPhone 4. Apparently a customer brought the phone into the store to try and get help with it, although it’s pretty evident that the phone is unrepairable. It’s the first time our guy has seen this happen (us too), but the brand new iPhone 4 caught on fire while being hooked up to a computer using the Apple USB cable that accompanied the device. The customer wanted to exchange the iPhone — obviously — for a new, non-charred unit however the AT&T store in question was out of stock. An Apple Store did confirm to our AT&T connection that this did appear to be a defective USB port and not some sort of user error. Our source went onto say that the phone bezel was extremely hot (obviously), and it slightly burned the customers hand. The USB port in the phone was slightly melted and the cord was badly melted (as is apparent in the pictures). Hopefully this is the only time we see our beloved iPhones meet a fiery death. We’ve got one more picture for you after the break.

The Motorola Droid and Apple iPhone may be different on the outside, but inside there are some distinct similarities.Though the Motorola Droid and Apple iPhone have different chassis, their high-octane engines are similar.The internal similarities begin with performance: both devices are fast. The iPhone 3GS is already distinguished for its speed. And the Droid is quickly garnering similar accolades."The Droid makes a big leap in internal performance. Compared with its rather sluggish Android predecessors," CNET Reviews said, citing the speed at which the Droid opens applications and menus and scrolls through lists and switches display screens."We're really pumped to see all the industry excitement it's created," said Jeff Dougan, the OMAP 3 product marketing manager at Texas Instruments, which supplies the OMAP 3430 processor that powers the Droid. "This is the first handset that truly realizes the full potential of Android," he said, referring to Google's Android 2.0 operating system that runs on the Droid phone.The TI processor, like the one in the iPhone, is based on an a new architecture called Cortex-A8 from U.K.-based chip design house ARM, whose wide variety of chips populate most of the world's cell phones. Dougan says most smartphones currently on the market use an older, lower-performance ARM architecture than the Cortex-A8--with the exception of the Palm Pre, which opted for the newer TI chip. The Cortex-A8 provides a "two to three times performance boost" over older architectures, according to Dougan.Max Baron, an analyst at Microprocessor Report, says the chips in the Droid and the iPhone (see not below) are so alike that differences are more dependent on the operating systems the two chips use and how successfully each phone maker optimizes the OS. "With chips that have near-similar specs, the optimum OS and the look-and-feel of the user interface may make or break the product," Baron said."The caveat, however, is that even small differences in chips will surface and become important differentiators as soon as the market forces you to increase the screen size or add more pixels per screen, or execute more power-consuming applications," he added.The raw MHz ratings on the chips are slightly different. The processor in the iPhone 3GS--which is believed to be based on the Samsung S5PC100 processor--runs at 600MHz, according to most accounts. The Motorola Droid's TI chip is rated at 550MHz though theoretically it can be run as fast as 600MHz, according to TI's Dougan.Both phones also use PowerVR graphics from Imagination Technologies--a company that both Apple and Intel have invested in, testifying to how hot its ultramobile graphics technology is. The PowerVR SGX is renowned for its ability to process several million triangles-per-second--a key indicator of graphics chip performance--blowing away other phones and the previous version of the iPhone.Other internal specifications are similar between the two phones, including memory capacity (either 16GB or 32GB) and communications chips that offer 3G, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connections.So, internally the Droid is every bit the iPhone's equal. And future versions of TI OMAP 3 chips that may appear in upcoming Droids will be backed by formidable ecosystems, according to Baron. "Investments in application software may lean more toward the TI components," said Baron, given TI's strong support of the entire chip ecosystem, including auxiliary chips and software development tools.Note:: Apple's and Samsung's reluctance to release information about the processor used in the iPhone 3GS has made it difficult to determine if the chip is based on the Samsung S5PC100, according to the Microprocessor Report's Baron. Many iPhone 3GS reviews and teardowns, however, state explicitly that the iPhone's processor is essentially the Samsung S5PC100 processor.

The employer of the spouse of my enemy's lawyerApple's billion dollar patent court victory should be dismissed, Samsung say, because the jury foreman in the case was biased. Samsung's call for a retrial in the fight between the two tech giants will be heard on 6th December by judge Lucy Koh in the same San Jose court where the original verdict was handed down.New information about the Jury Foreman Velvin Hogan taints the jury verdict, Samsung says. Hogan did not reveal to the court that he was bankrupted following a lawsuit against a company in which Samsung is now a shareholder. Hogan was sued by his former employer Seagate Technologies in 1993 and filed for bankruptcy. As of 2011 Samsung have owned a chunk of Seagate shares, in exchange for selling the storage company their HDD business.Sammie have asked Apple to disclose when these two facts became known to Apple.Apple has rejected all the charges in a counter-motion, describing Samsung's argument as a "convoluted theory", and throwing scorn on the idea that Hogan would try to "exact revenge" on a Seagate shareholder and the spouse of a lawyer who had acted against him 19 years ago.Samsung’s theory fails on the merits because the decades-old Seagate dispute has nothing to do with this case and would not have supported challenge for cause, and Samsung has not shown that Mr. Hogan’s responses were “dishonest” and “material,” as Supreme Court precedent requires.Apple have added that it was up to Samsung's lawyers to quiz and approve jury members before the trial.Koh said yesterday that she would hear the arguments on the 6th December. ®APPLE, INC. v.

The target release date for the unlock is New Year’s Eve 2008. This unlock method is available to iPhone 3Gs that have 2.11.07 baseband or earlier, we did warn you. You can tell what version baseband you have by going to Settings->General->About->Modem Firmware. The unlock requires a jailbroken 3G iPhone.  It’ll be installable via Cydia, and so it doesn’t matter if you have a Mac or PC. Please refrain from updating your baseband, regardless of what version you’re at.  We’ll have complete directions on New Year’s Eve. We’ll stream a live demo of the unlock before Christmas (see the update at the end of this post).Softpedia doesn't condone jailbreaking / unlocking your iPhone / iPod touch or any other device. Using hacks may render your device unusable, or may considerably reduce the quality of your experience using the respective device. If you choose to download and install the PwnageTool, you do it at your own risk.The iPhone Dev Team, best known for its PwnageTool and QuickPwn hack software, has confirmed the completion of the iPhone 3G unlock. Those interested in jailbreaking their devices are advised not to upgrade to OS 2.2 using iTunes alone.“Over the Christmas break some of our members will be talking at the Chaos Computer Club’s 25C3 Congress,” a Dev-Team Blog post reads. “This talk will be a juicy technical talk relating to iPhone platform and our previous exploits.[...] We have been working hard on a few other things. The main one being the 3G unlock codenamed 'yellowsn0w.' This is now completed and is currently being packaged into a user-friendly application with the simplicity that you see in QuickPwn or BootNeuter.” Some facts for visitors of the blog are also listed. Readers are assumed to be OK with jailbreaks, hence the team's advice of refraining from updating the iPhone 3G's baseband. Read on for the details: It has been recently revealed that the newly-released Mac OS X 10.5.6 update keeps Macs from recognizing the iPhone in DFU mode , making it impossible to jailbreak / unlock it using PwnageTool or QuickPwn. Taking on the DFU Issues in OS X 10.5.6, the Dev Team explains that “Lots of users have been experiencing problems with the use of DFU mode after applying yesterday’s 10.5.6 system update. We believe this behavior is due to a kernel bug not a specific countermeasure by Apple.” The team offers some workarounds, but asks not to be held responsible should anything bad happen. It's probably best if you wait until New Year's Eve to jailbreak your device. Of course, it's probably even better to read the text in red and act accordingly.

Apple says terrorists could use iPhones to attack cell phone towersApple has tried everything to stop iPhone unlockers.  Bricking iPhones didn't work -- it just generated more headaches and bad PR.  Apple's internal protection technology turned out to be just as weak and poorly implemented as its consumer security on the iPhone -- the hackers quickly overcame the latest protections Apple threw at them.  Now with its shiny new iPhone 3G S becoming yet the latest handset to be freed, Apple has turned to none other than the U.S. government for help. The company has submit a report to the U.S. Copyright Office suggesting that iPhone unlocking be outlawed (and jailbreaking from the AT&T network, essentially as well as it would be impossible without unlocking) as Apple claims it threatens cell phone towers across America.  Apple claims that unlocking the iPhone provides easy access to the iPhone’s BBP — the “baseband processor” software, which enables a connection to cell phone towers. According to Apple, the BBP could then be exploited by "a local or international hacker could potentially initiate commands (such as a denial of service attack) that could crash the tower software, rendering the tower entirely inoperable to process calls or transmit data." States Apple, "Taking control of the BBP software would be much the equivalent of getting inside the firewall of a corporate computer — to potentially catastrophic result.  The technological protection measures were designed into the iPhone precisely to prevent these kinds of pernicious activities, and if granted, the jailbreaking exemption would open the door to them." Currently, iPhone unlocking falls under a legal gray zone.  The comments by Apple come in response to an ongoing request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to legalize the widespread practice of unlocking.  Apple wants to push it in the other direction make unlocking and jailbreaking the phone illegal. Fred von Lohmann, the EFF attorney in charge of the EFF request mocked Apple's filing openly, calling its claims "preposterous".  He says that there's an estimated 1 million unlocked iPhones operating in the U.S. and that they have posed no threat thus far.  He states, "As far as I know, nothing like that has ever happened.  This kind of theoretical threat is more FUD than truth." Apple also claims that unlocking and jailbreaking also could be used to enable the alteration of the Exclusive Chip Identification number, allowing for anonymous phone calls.  States Apple, "This would be desirable to drug dealers." Unlocking the iPhone may currently be banned under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which states that "no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title." However, citizen requests, such as the EFF filing, must be considered for exemption every three years.  The Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office is tasked with that responsibility.

Apple has found a new way to get people to agree to online tracking: withhold applications from them if they don't. This week Apple is launching a new iPhone. And with that comes a new operating system and the company's new advertising platform.According to Apple's new privacy policy, users can opt out if they don't want to be served targeted ads. But if they don't want to share their location information with the company, they also won't have access to new apps from the iTunes store.The launch of Apple's iAd advertising system this week comes with some new terms and conditions. Apple will be serving targeted advertising. Users can opt out of receiving such ads, but it won't be particularly easy. And the company thinks it would be cooler if people didn't opt out. According to the new T&Cs:"Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests."Apple customers who want to opt out of tracking have to use the above URL from an Apple device running iOS 4 to do so. And each of their devices using that operating system must be logged out individually.In addition, Apple is collecting "precise," "real-time geographic location" of its customers who use its new iOS software that runs on the new iPhone.Apple's wording assures customers that location data is “collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.” But it also doesn't give people a choice to opt out of location tracking. Users have to agree to the new terms and conditions before downloading new apps or any other data from the iTunes store.Meanwhile, the new T&Cs are light on details regarding what will happen with this location information. The company's privacy policy states:"To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work."Obviously, applications that rely on location will be among the “partners and licensees” who will access location data. But it would be nice to have details on what location-based services other than Find My iPhonewill utilize the data. Apple also insists that the data will be anonymous, but they are not divulging how long the data will be kept, which could irk privacy advocates.

Motorola targets young men with its most testosterone-heavy TV commercial yetSomeone had fun writing this ad copy:Droid. Should a phone be pretty? Should it be a tiara-wearing digitally clueless beauty pageant queen? Or should it be fast? Racehorse duct-taped to a Scud missile fast. We say the latter. So we built the phone that does. Does rip through the Web like a circular saw through a ripe banana. Is it a precious porcelain figurine of a phone? In truth? No. It's not a princess. It's a robot. A phone that trades hair-do for can-do.The new Droid commercial that debuted in prime-time Thursday night (and is pasted below the fold) opened a new front in Motorola (MOT) and Verizon's (VZ) $100 million ad campaign to take market share from Apple's (AAPL) iPhoneEarlier commercials had appealed to the fragile male ego with icons of masculinity: stealth bombers, heavyweight fighters, rock-crushing machinery.This one goes after the competition by painting it -- and its users -- as effeminate.It's a strategy as old as the schoolyard, and it seems to be working -- at least on one side of the yard. A new YouGov BrandIndex survey taken Thursday shows Motorola's buzz rising relative to Apple's and Research in Motion's (RIMM) among men 18 and older. And the company seems to be on track in its stated goal of selling 1 million Droids by New Years.It remains to be seen whether it has burned its bridges to the other half of the market in the process.

Continuing its productivity war on Apple, Microsoft, and everyone in between, Google on Monday enabled Exchange support for iPhone and Windows Mobile device owners. This is in addition to Google's existing tool for BlackBerry phones, but the company is also including contact sync support for other phones via the standard SyncML protocol.Wrapped under the product umbrella of Google Sync, Gmail contacts and Google Calendar events can now be synchronized via over-the-air (OTA) push between Windows Mobile devices and both first- and second-generation iPhones (note, however, that iPhone OS 2.2 is required). Configuration for these devices is performed via their respective, built-in ActiveSync and Exchange configuration features, respectively, though Google Sync strangely does not support push e-mail for these devices yet. Microsoft says that Google licensed the Exchange ActiveSync, and these features are available for free today for both general consumers and, for once, Google Apps users at the same time.As is usual for the Internet giant, Google warns that Google Sync is in beta, so users are encouraged to check out Google's list of known limitations for the iPhone and Windows Mobile. As examples, the iPhone does not reflect attendee status for events, and syncing more than five calendars often results in all calendars being displayed in a bright yellow or cyan color on an iPhone (Google says it is working with Apple to fix this problem). Modifying a single instance of a recurring event on an iPhone can also result in duplicates, while Windows Mobile devices suffer their own hiccups when making changes to recurring events or meeting attendees.Google also details its support for syncing contacts with other mobile devices that support SyncML. In general, any device that supports the protocol should work, but Google officially supports devices running Nokia Symbian S60 2nd and 3rd edition (such as the E-Series, 6120/6121, N70, and N90), as well as "most" Sony Ericsson phones.Free push service for contacts and calendar events is another major volley from Google against its competition. Google enabled free IMAP in October 2007 while competitors like Yahoo and Microsoft are still putzing with POP3, and Gmail Labs has brought a virtual landslide of new features since its introduction less than a year ago. Google Calendar has also received a modest share of attention as it is one of the key components of Google Apps' invasion efforts into Microsoft Office's turf.There is no doubt, however, that today's announcement will leave Gmail and Apps users clamoring even more loudly for push support to come to Gmail as well. At this point it is safe to assume that, after Gmail gained offline access, push mail is probably not far behind.

If you want an unlocked 3G iPhone, you have a couple options. If you havenâ€™t upgraded to 2.2, you can try your luck with one of those SIM piggyback wafers; otherwise, you can try importing from a country like Hong Kong, which sells unlocked iPhones officially.Thereâ€™s a third option, though: take a trip to Hanoi, for 1.2 million dong (snicker! Also: about $80) you can have your iPhone 3G physically unlocked by an industrious Vietnamese mobile phone hacker.First, a technician opened up the phone and stripped it to the motherboard. In his skillful hands, the device seemed much easier to dismantle than I expected.The technician then extracted the baseband chip, the component that controls the connection between the phone and the mobile network, from the motherboard. (This is a painstaking task as the chip is strongly glued to the phoneâ€™s motherboard. A mistake during this process could brick the phone completely.)Once the chip was extracted, it was Tuan Anhâ€™s turn. He used a chip reader to read information into a file. He then used a Hex editor to remove the locking data from the file, and after that, the chip got reprogrammed with the newly altered file. Now it was no longer programmed to work with only a specific provider.The chip then got reassembled into the motherboard, another painstaking process.As a last step, the technician put the phone back together, and it looked like nothing had been done to it.

Police have located and spoken to the man who found an iPhone prototype left behind by an Apple engineer at a San Francisco-area bar last month, according to media reports.Stephen Wagstaffe, a San Mateo County District Attorney spokesman, said police in Redwood City have spoken to the man but declined to disclose his name, according to reports by both CNET News and KCBS.In a recorded message on his work phone Wednesday, Wagstaffe said there was nothing new to report on the iPhone case and there was "nothing further to discuss concerning what has gone on so far."Wagstaffe also declined to say if the man is suspected of selling the prototype phone to Gizmodo, an online gadget guide site, the reports said.Last week, the New York Times reported Gizmodo paid the man $5,000 US for the prototype dubbed iPhone 4, 4G or HD in blogs, and posted photos and video of it on April 19 showing its new features, including a camera flash and a second camera for video chatting.Gizmodo editor Jason Chen said the phone had been left at a bar in Redwood City by one of Apple Inc.'s engineers.Chen arranged to return the iPhone when the company posted a letter by its lawyer asking for its return last week.Last Friday, a special computer-crime task force made up of different law enforcement agencies searched Chen's house and car in Fremont, Calif., and took computers, servers and accessories.The search warrant said the computer and other devices may have been used to commit a felony. Investigators also seized Chen's credit card bills and copies of his cheques.Chen's lawyers argue that California's shield law, which protects journalists from having to turn over anonymous sources or unpublished material to law enforcement during a search, should apply to him.

Steve Jobs has responded to the mounting questions about iPhones collecting location data for up to a year - a revelation that could lead to privacy investigations by some European governments.In a characteristically terse email, apparently sent directly from his iPhone, the Apple chief executive - who is officially on medical leave from his company, and has been seen only briefly in public since January - insisted that "we don't track anyone", and instead aimed his ire at Google, claiming that "they do" track users.The exchange, documented by a reader of the MacRumors website who emailed Jobs (whose address is well-known online), appears to be legitimate. Apple has not commented on its provenance.Could you please explain the necessity of the passive location-tracking tool embedded in my iPhone? It's kind of unnerving knowing that my exact location is being recorded at all times. Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a [Google Android] Droid. They don't track me.Oh yes they do. We don't track anyone. The info circulating around is false.While it is certainly true that Android phones do gather anonymised location information, Google has insisted that the collection is opt-in, with a clear dialogue which the user is presented with before proceeding. In addition, Google's system only retains the most recent 50 mobile cell masts and 200 Wi-Fi networks seen, and in a form that is hard to access. By contrast Apple's seems to collect an almost unlimited amount in a form which is easily accessible to anyone who gets their hands on the phone.Apple has also confirmed to the US Congress that iPhones and iPads collect location data when permitted by the user, and buried in the lengthy license document for the iTunes Store (used to synchronise data) is an 86-word paragraph which gives the company the right to access location data collected by the user.However the data is all anonymised, with no personal details of the user or physical addresses for the phone.Jobs's claim that "we don't track anyone" is arguably true, in that Apple could not target named individuals. However the benefits of the location-tracking services to targeted advertising based on whether a phone is being used are clear to both Apple and Google.Jobs's assertion that "The info circulating around is false" is hard to analyse, given that he does not say which information he is referring to. But hundreds of people have posted maps online showing how their iPhone or iPad has tracked their movements.

Electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn has denied earlier reports that thousands of workers went on strike on Friday at a plant that assembles Apple’s latest iPhone — reportedly causing production of the device to be “paralysed”. Today Foxconn said no such strike took place and claimed production of the iPhone 5 is on schedule, Reuters is reporting.Earlier reports had suggested 3,000 to 4,000 workers began striking at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou complex on Friday afternoon — with the disputes apparently triggered by “over-exacting quality controls” on iPhone 5 production, compounded by a lack of worker training to meet the new, higher standards. Demands that workers also work through a week-long national holiday also caused tensions to boil over into industrial action, according to reports.But Foxconn Technology Group sent Reuters a statement today denying there had been a strike. It said two brief and small disputes took place at the plant in question, several days earlier, but claimed these were “immediately addressed” and did not escalate into an “employee strike”. Additional staff were also provided for “the lines in question”, it added.“Any reports that there has been an employee strike are inaccurate,” Reuters quotes Foxconn in an emailed statement. Foxconn added that “there has been no workplace stoppage in that facility or any other Foxconn facility and production has continued on schedule”. Employees who worked over the national holiday did so voluntarily, it added.Also in the email, Foxconn said it received instructions from Apple to “strengthen quality inspections” for the iPhone 5 — “following multiple complaints from customers regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone”.We’ve asked Apple to confirm this claim and will update with any response.

It might be a cliche, but sometimes, a picture says more than a thousand words. Over the years, I've often talked about how the technology world is iterative, about how products are virtually always built upon that which came before, about how almost always, multiple people independently arrive at the same products since they work within the same constraints of the current state of technology. This elementary aspect of the technology world, which some would rather forget, has been illustrated very, very well in one of Samsung's legal filings against AppleThis is what Samsung was considering putting to market in the summer of 2006, six months before the unveiling of the iPhone.One of these phones (the bottom-right one) became the Samsung F700 - a product Apple once included as an infringing product, but later withdrew once it learned Samsung created it and brought it to market before the iPhoneIt extends to more than just the hardware - Samsung was also working on interfaces that looks remarkably like iOS (actually, that look remarkably like PalmOS) - in the summer and fall of 2006. Again, before the iPhone was released.The most damning and interesting graphic is one of those 'before-after-the-iPhone'-ones. In it, Samsung quite effectively demonstrates that its phones - like the Galaxy line - are clearly descendant from Samsung's pre-iPhone designs, and not from the iPhone.Seems like an open and shut case to me. Samsung didn't have to look very far for prior art - it created it itself. Doesn't that just boggle the mind? Samsung is being accused of stealing, even thought the company was clearly working on what it supposedly stole before the iPhone was even released. Samsung's phones bear more resemblance to its own pre-iPhone designs than to the iPhone, yet Apple and its supporters still insist Samsung is a thief.All this reminds me a lot of the early '80s and the development of the graphical user interface (a process I prefer to divide up into generations). The 'invention' of the GUI was a very long process, which, in my view, started with Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad (1st generation GUI), and ended with the work done at Xerox (3rd generation GUI). I say 'ended' because even though some people are easily fooled by fancier graphics and swapping a mouse for a finger, every device we own still employs what is essentially Xerox' interface.Xerox didn't realise they were sitting on a revolution, so other companies swooped in and created the 4th generation of GUIs; Apple, Amiga, and Digital Research (GEM) all developed a fourth generation GUI simultaneously in pretty much the same timespan. However, these days, many people just give all the credit to Apple and be done with it.Apple acts as if the iPhone was developed in a vacuum, and wants the world to believe that it, and only it, invented the concept of a touchscreen phone. With that nonsensical idea, the company not only ignores the long history of mobile computing (specifically PalmOS which is iOS' and Android's common ancestor), but also the fact that other companies were working on touchscreen phones at the same time (LG Prada, these Samsung images).Apple wants to rewrite history. As a geek, I find that incredibly offensive.

Apple is selling the iPhone 3G on its Apple Store Web site in Hong Kong, promising the phones "can be activated with any wireless carrier."The Apple Store in Hong Kong is selling the 8GB and 16GB iPhone 3G models for HK$5,400 (US$695) and HK$6,200, respectively, with free shipping. The store advertises the compatibility of the phones with any carrier, saying, "Simply insert the SIM [subscriber identity module] from your current phone into iPhone 3G and connect to iTunes 8 to complete activation."On the Apple Store's main page for Hong Kong, the site says, "Buy directly from Apple. And choose your carrier.""Customer response to the iPhone 3G has been off the charts, and we are thrilled to offer our customers in Hong Kong another way to get their hands on this revolutionary device," an Apple spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to questions.The company did not comment on whether online iPhone 3G sales and activation will be extended to other markets.The iPhone 3G has been available in Hong Kong since July 11 through Hutchison Telecommunications. The cheapest monthly plan offered by the operator charges HK$2,938 for the 8GB version and HK$3,738 for the 16GB one, along with a two-year contract that costs HK$188 per month.Checks of the Apple Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Singapore, show the iPhone 3G is not available for sale online. Instead, the sites offer a link to a list of stores where the phone is on sale.

When you see people flipping through e-books on iPads or iPhones, there is a good chance they bought the books through Amazon.com, not Apple.Now, Apple wants to change that.Apple confirmed Tuesday that it would require app developers that sell e-books outside of their iPad and iPhone apps — through a Web site, for example — to also sell the books inside those apps. And purchases that originate in the app must be made through Apple, which keeps a 30 percent cut.Apple said it was newly enforcing an existing rule, one that will force Amazon, Sony, Google and other e-book sellers to change the way their apps work.“We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app,” Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.Amazon makes Kindle reading apps for the iPad and iPhone, and those apps now send readers to a Web browser window to make book purchases from Amazon, dodging the Apple fee. Sony said on Monday that Apple had rejected its reading app, which worked the same way.The move is surprising because Apple has benefited from the wealth of content available for its devices, said Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a consultant to book publishers.“Most of the people reading on the iPad are buying their books from these other people, and that’s a great thing for Apple,” Mr. Shatzkin said. “It’s selling tons of devices for Apple and tons of content for everybody else.”It is highly unlikely that Amazon, Sony or others will be willing to share e-book revenue or customer information with its competitor, Apple, which sells its own e-books in its iBookstore.Steve Haber, president of Sony’s digital reading business, said that Sony was working on “different ways to bring content to Apple devices,” though he declined to elaborate on what those are.For now, Apple has said only that it is applying the rule to e-books. But other apps give customers the ability to make outside purchases, so it could potentially apply to apps that sell movies, magazines, music or virtual goods in games as well. Apple declined to comment on whether the rule applied to apps other than e-readers.

Apple's chief foe in the mobile sector and in the courtroom goes after the new iPhone, alleging that the device infringes on eight of its patents.Fresh off a courtroom victory against Apple today, Samsung filed another legal salvo against its chief foe.The Korean electronics giant submitted an amendment to a lawsuit originally filed in April against Apple, adding the iPhone 5 to a list of devices that includes the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the new iPad that Samsung accuses of infringing on several Samsung patents.Samsung reportedly threatened to sue Apple last month for patent infringement over its then rumored use of long-term evolution (LTE) connectivity in the next-generation smartphone. While the new iPhone's debut last month confirmed that Apple's new device featured access to the the speedier fourth-generation wireless networking -- for which Samsung holds numerous patents -- Samsung's latest lawsuit did not address the LTE patentsA Samsung representative told CNET this evening that the eight patents in question include six utility patents and two standard essential patents unrelated to its LTE patent portfolio (see filing below).Echoing previous statements made in the patent dispute, Samsung said, "we have little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights."CNET has contacted Apple for comment and will update this report when we learn more.In a bit of a one-two punch, Samsung added the iPhone 5 as a legal target after a federal judge issued an order dissolving a three-month-old ban on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the U.S. Samsung's once-flagship device was with stipulation that it could be reversed if Samsung was cleared of infringing on an Apple tablet design patent -- which happened during Apple's overwhelming patent victory over Samsung last month.Updated at 10:45 p.m. PT with more information from Samsung.

AT&T’s Ralph de la Vega this morning said the carrier either has to “reduce or modify” the mobile data consumption of some of its high-end users. Which could mean the end of flat-rate pricing in favor of prices that vary based on network congestion.AT&T’s Ralph de la Vega used today’s UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York to deliver a message to the carrier’s data-hungry mobile users: We will have ways of modifying — or monetizing — your behavior.Noting that roughly 3 percent of AT&T users generate 40 percent of the traffic on the network, de la Vega spoke of offering “incentives” to get users to curb their data habits. Those “incentives,” though, may come in the form of stiffer fees or higher changes for downloading information during business hours — what’s known as congestion pricing for mobile broadband.“I’m not going to give you in detail what we’re going to do, but if three are causing 40 percent, then we’re going to try to focus on making sure we give incentives to those small percentages to either reduce or modify their usage so they don’t crowd out the other users in those same cell sites,” de la Vega said. “You’ll see us address that more in detail in the future…What’s driving usage on the network and driving these high-usage situations are things like video or audio that keeps playing around the clock. We’ve got to get to those customers and have them recognize and change their patterns.”As Stacey wrote a few months ago (GigaOM Pro, sub. required), a combination of attractive price plans, high-quality smartphones and the rise of mobile applications are already driving mobile broadband usage — in a big way. Much of the traffic is due to streaming content such as web-based video and on-the-go music services that require far more bandwidth than things like text messaging and mobile e-mail. And that consumption will surely continue to surge as netbooks and a flood of other connected devices come to market, and as the fatter pipes of LTE make accessing content even easier and faster.Indeed, de la Vega this morning said that simply boosting capacity on AT&T’s 850 Mhz network in New York resulted in an “overnight” traffic increase of 30 percent. AT&T’s woes are a prime example of network shortcomings, to be sure, and the carrier is scrambling to appease data-hungry users by upgrading its 3G network to HSPAen route to the 4G technology LTE. But other operators are certain to experience such growing pains as they grow their data businesses with iPhone-like handsets.Carriers are increasingly turning to technologies like Wi-Fi and femtocells to help offload the increasing traffic, but operators will likely also abandon their flat-rate pricing models in favor of congestion pricing. A consumer who uses mobile data primarily for email on the phone, for instance, could opt for 200kbps service while a netbook-toting road warrior could be asked to shell out for a 1.5Mbps connection. And connectivity could vary not just by user but also by use case, giving consumers the flexibility to pay more when they need a lot of data quickly or during peak hours. Cable operators and a handful of European ISPs are already toying with such models.Congestion pricing has some substantial drawbacks, of course. Charging consumers based on a host of variables is a marketing strategy destined to foster confusion in the minds of users, and it could force carriers to make upgrades to billing infrastructures to ensure users are billed accurately. But with mobile data already straining the capacity of some operators’ networks, it’s a model you may see sooner than you expect.

Smule has done it again. The company behind the ingenious lighter app that took the iPhone by storm a few months ago has launched Ocarina, a networked musical instrument that allows you to listen to songs being played around the world in real time. The app costs 99 cents, and you can grab it here.As an instrument Ocarina has been perfectly executed, and is much more suitable for the iPhone’s screen size than the virtual keyboards and guitars that litter the App Store. To play, you blow into the iPhone’s microphone while fingering notes using the 4 ‘holes’ on the ocarina. Smule says that the microphone can detect subtle variations in air flow, explaining that “unlike other iPhone audio apps, the sound is not pre-compiled but is generated by the notes, gestures and nuance of the individual performer”.And for the vast majority of the population that has no idea how to play an ocarina, the app has another awesome feature: you can listen in on the songs being played on any iPhone worldwide. After selecting the ‘globe’ view, the app presents you with a 3D world littered with a number of little dots presumably representing every active Ocarina. The app will automatically start playing one of these, highlighted by a series of green blobs rising from Earth, each of which corresponds to a note. If you don’t like what you’re listening to, you can hit the ‘next’ button to start playing a new song (you’ll probably be using this button often, as many of the people playing are awful).This is how an iPhone app should be done. As we pointed out in September, too few developers are leveraging the platform’s network effect to differentiate themselves, instead choosing to develop standalone apps that can be easily cloned. By being first to market with this app, Smule has safeguarded itself against the competition: even if another ocarina app comes along that is network compatible, Smule’s application will likely have the largest user base and will be very difficult to catch up with. And if Smule is smart, it’ll keep making these virtual instruments, allowing it to share the same network to create a worldwide orchestra that would be nearly impossible to replicate (and it sounds like it will – the company has developed an audio platform called ChucK that will likely be applied to other instruments).For another app that is trying to tap into the iPhone’s network effect, check out Chess With Friends, which we covered yesterday.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is refuting a statement made by members of AntiSec this weekend that they hacked the laptop of an FBI special agent and stole a file containing 12 million Apple device IDs and associated personal information.The FBI also said it did not possess a file containing the data the hackers said they stole.In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the FBI said, “The FBI is aware of published reports alleging that an FBI laptop was compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs was exposed. At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.”In case that wasn’t emphatic enough, the FBI also tweeted:Over the weekend, the hacker group AntiSec released an encrypted file that containing 1 million Apple device IDs and device names that the group said was obtained from an FBI computer they hacked.The hackers said the original file contained 12 million IDs, including personal information, but they released only 1 million (leaving out the personal data) in an encrypted file published on torrent sites.In a lengthy post online, the hackers wrote that last March, they hacked a laptop belonging to an FBI agent named Christopher K. Stangl from the bureau’s Regional Cyber Action Team and the New York FBI office’s Evidence Response Team.The hackers say the IDs were stored in a file on Stangl’s desktop titled “NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv.”The file, according to the hackers, contained a list of more than 12 million Apple iOS devices, including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, names of devices, types of devices, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, ZIP codes, cellphone numbers, and addresses.The hackers suggested in a tweet from the @AnonymousIRC account that the FBI was using the information to track users.But the FBI disputes this. The FBI did not say whether the NCFTA, which was allegedly referred to in the file name the hackers obtained, possessed the data.NCFTA refers to the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance. The NCFTA is a non-profit that was founded in 1997 by FBI agent Dan Larkin as a conduit between private industry and law enforcement agencies to help them exchange data and cooperate on cases.The organization’s members include financial institutions, telecommunications firms, ISPs, and other private industries.The NCFTA did not respond to a call seeking comment.Apple UDIDs are a 40-character alphanumeric string that is unique to each Apple device.The hackers say they released the Apple UDIDs so that people would know that the FBI may be tracking their devices and also because, they wrote in their online post, “we think it’s the right moment to release this knowing that Apple is looking for alternatives for those UDID currently … but well, in this case it’s too late for those concerned owners on the list.”Apple has been criticized for hard-coding the IDs in devices, since they can be misused by application developers and others to identify a user, when combined with other information, and track them. Last April, Apple began rejecting applications that track UDIDs.The Next Web has created a tool for users to check if their Apple UDID is among those that the hackers released.Update 9.6.12: Apple, which had initially declined to comment on the story, released a statement after the FBI released its statement. According to Apple, “The FBI has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization. Additionally, with iOS 6 we introduced a new set of APIs meant to replace the use of the UDID and will soon be banning the use of UDID.”

Update: The iPhone 2.0 software is now available. Update 2: Top apps by number of downloads is here.Apple’s iPhone App Store is now live, several hours ahead of its rumored 9 am PST launch. To access it, download iTunes 7.7 here. Once iTunes has upgraded, you can access the App Store here.You can “get apps” on iTunes now, but you’ll need the iPhone 2.0 software to actually use them on the iPhone, which isn’t yet available.There are 27 pages of applications currently available. We’ve updating our directory with the more interesting applications now. At first glance, there are very few non-English applications. Another interesting trend – a lot of books are listed as applications, most for $0.99 (I just bought Heart of Darkness, for example).According to Pinch Media, the App Store had 552 applications at launch. 135 of these apps are free, while the remaining 417 range in price from $0.99 to $69.99, with the vast majority ranging between $0.99 and $9.99.Some people are saying they can’t see the app store even after downloading v 7.7 of iTunes and clicking on the link above. Here’s a qik video I took of the store if you can’t access it yourself:Here are screen shots of the Facebook and MySpace App on iTunes, as well as one of the directory pages:

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureThe EU is readying a new set of directives that could spell trouble for Apple's iPhone and any other gadget that lacks an easily removable power pack.A new, draft batteries directive mandates that power cells inside electronic devices must be "readily removable" for replacement and safe disposal. This isn't the case with the iPhone, which does not have a user-replaceable battery.Under the terms of the directive, by 2012, at least 25 per cent of all portable batteries - including mobile phone, laptop and car batteries - used annually in each member state must be recycled. By 2016, 45 per cent of them have to be.Mercury, lead and cadmium are by far the most challenging substances in the battery waste stream, the EU says.Although finer details of the removable-battery mandate have not yet been defined - is it sufficient for the supplier to be able to remove a product's battery? - Gary Nevison of Leeds-based repair services company Premier Farnell believes the requirement is "clearly intended to ensure that users can remove batteries by opening a cover by hand or after removal of one or two screws". ®

For those who don't know, Apple and AT&T removed an application that allowed your iPhone to interface with Google Voice. But, in removing GV Mobile from the app store, Apple has cut the application off from any future updates or bug fixes. The reality is that Apple took your money, and has interfered in your ability to get updates to a program you purchased.If you ask for a refund, Apple will happily refund your money, but, here's the stark reality of such a decision... The author, who received 70% of the purchase price when you bought the software, now has to refund 100% of the purchase price when you ask for a refund. In real numbers, The author made $2.09 on a $2.99 program. But, we has to give BACK $2.99--actually costing the author 90 cents for you to get a refund! Apple keeps the 90 cents profit no matter what.So, you want compensation, but you don't want to hurt the author? Here’s what I did.. This hurts APPLE and not the author! I called up apple corporate offices and told them that I want my money back as “compensation” — NOT as a refund. I was very specific that I did not want a refund on the app; that I wanted APPLE to cover my cost. They ended up crediting my account for 5-free song downloads, (Yes, it's a pathetic compensation, but, it’s something.. and it’s something that won’t hurt Sean, but DOES cost Apple money).I spoke to Robert Barger @ Apple Corporate care.

Samsung appears to have become the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, passing Finland's Nokia, top since 1998, as Samsung Electronics reported record first-quarter results.Though the company did not reveal precise numbers, some analysts reckon that it sold more smartphones – 44.5m – in the first three months of the year than Apple's 35.1m for its iPhone. Overall, they calculated that it shipped 93.5m mobile phones, compared with 82.7m for Nokia.Samsung's estimated total gave it a 30.6% share of the smartphone market. Apple's sales gave it a 24.1% share."Samsung and Apple are out-competing most major rivals, and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two-horse race," said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics.Net profit nearly doubled from a year earlier to a record 5.05tn won (£2.75bn) for the quarter to 31 March. Operating profit also hit a record high, at 5.85tn won, which was in line with expectations.Sales rose 22% from a year earlier to 45.3tn won. Shares in the company jumped by 3%. More than 70% of its operating profit came from the mobile business, which saw a surge in sales of its Galaxy smartphones.But Nokia, which has slipped from top place in both mobile phones and smartphones after being passed by both Apple and Samsung, saw its debt marked down a notch by ratings agency Fitch, to BB+ from BBB-. The agency warned that further downgrades could follow.Last week Nokia announced one of its worst quarterly results ever, blaming tough competition for a €929m net loss as sales plunged, especially in the smartphone market. It said it expects no improvement in the second quarter.Analysts could not agree on how many smartphones Samsung shipped because the company only gave relative numbers for revenue and profit compared to the year-ago quarter. Research company IHS Suppli catalogues the Samsung Galaxy Note, with a 5in screen, as a tablet rather than a phone, lowering the total smartphone numbers below Apple's.Samsung's mobile communications division, which makes smartphones and a range of tablets, generated 4.27tn won of operating profit in the quarter after seeing significant sales growth of high-end smartphones in developing markets including China, a key battlefield for mobile phone makers.However Apple's iPhone and iPad business remains more lucrative. The Cupertino, California-based company earned $11.6bn (£7.2bn) in the January-March quarter, more than twice as much as Samsung, even though its revenue was about 10% less.

Apple has been sued by a group of about 27,000 South Koreans in a class-action lawsuit over alleged privacy violations related to location services on iPhones, iPads and the iPod Touch.The suit, filed Wednesday in Changwon, South Korea, seeks about 27 billion won, or about $26 million, in damages, which would work out to about $930 for each plaintiff, the Associated Press reports.The complaint says Apple's iOS location services infringe on privacy rights because the iPhone stores location data obtained from nearby mobile network towers and Wi-Fi hot spots for as long as a year.The tech giant has faced criticism from consumers and politicians in the U.S. and abroad since the storage of location tracking data came to light earlier this year. The issue has prompted privacy questions for the mobile industry as a whole, including Google, creator of the rival Android operating system.Some iPhone and iPad owners have demonstrated that they can use the location data stored on their devices to create a map of their travels.Apple has said its mobile devices don't need to store location data for more than seven days and were keeping the information for as long as a year only because of a software glitch in the iOS operating system that runs the machines.The tech giant has released software updates to change how its iOS devices track a user's location for maps, geo-tagged photos and location-based apps such as Foursquare and Gowalla.Company representatives couldn't be reached Wednesday morning to comment about the lawsuit.

At PDC 2009, Microsoft demonstrated Silverlight video streaming to an iPhone. While Microsoft user experience platform manager Brian Goldfarb said that Microsoft "worked with Apple" to make it happen, don't expect plug-ins for Mobile Safari to start flooding the App Store. Instead, Microsoft worked to make its IIS7 server software capable of sending an QuickTime-compatible stream to an iPhone embedded with a HTML5 tag.Though Silverlight is more than just a video format—it's more of .NET authoring runtime for web-based applications, much like Flash as become—its media delivery features are what content providers wanted on the iPhone. "The promise of Silverlight is that it's a cross-device, cross-browser, cross-platform solution, and it works the same on Macs as it does on Windows," Goldfarb told BetaNews. "The iPhone is a unique scenario. We talked to our customers...and they said, 'Look, we just need to get our content there, and it's mainly in the media space like broadcasting, and we want to put it on the iPhone.'"The true extent of "working with Apple," though, has more to do with making sure the system would work and that Apple didn't disapprove. "We did all the work," Goldfarb said. "We just made sure Apple was comfortable with it. We have to have a strong partnership with our partners, we have to have trust, and that's key."What Microsoft did was enable IIS Media Services respond to requests from an iPhone and transcode on-demand to H.264 format in an MPEG-2 transport stream, the exact same format used by Apple's proposed HTTP Live Streaming protocol. "So it's the same IIS smooth streaming content, the same server, the same point of origin, but now I can get that content to play without any code changes, without any real work, on the iPhone," Goldfarb explained. "That's the critical thing for our customers."We won't be seeing an Silverlight runtime (nor a Flash one, for that matter) popping up on the iPhone. But content providers already using or considering IIS Media Services won't have to encode video separately or maintain a separate content delivery system for serving their content to the hottest mobile platform. So the real question is, when can I start streaming Netflix to my iPhone?

Services like Ustream and Qik have long offered the promise of live streaming video from your mobile phone to the web — except if you had an iPhone. For those devices, that was only possible if you jailbroke your phone. Not anymore.The Ustream Live Broadcaster has just gone live in the App Store tonight and yes, it allows you to stream live video from the iPhone to the web. And yes, it even works over a 3G connection. And yes, it’s awesome.While one of the key features of the iPhone 3GS was video recording capabilities, that was limited to recordings that were captured on your device and could be uploaded to the web after they were done recording. With the Ustream Live Broadcaster, you can easily record videos right to the web, and allow others to watch them as they’re being recorded. These videos can also be archived so that people can watch them later, if they choose.Settings within the app also make it easy to automatically tweet out when you go live, as well as to do things like share the videos on Facebook and YouTube. The live broadcast can also send out your location, if you’re into that sort of thing. The app also allows for chatting with viewers, and yes/no polling.Ustream has long promised that it would be the first to allow for live video streaming on the iPhone, and it looks like they’ve finally come through — though almost a year after we first wrote about it. They’ve had an iPhone app out for a while, but it hasn’t had live capabilities until now. Qik has had a live-streaming app, but it was only an ad-hoc app, meaning it wasn’t available in the App Store.This Ustream app’s approval follows the approval of another live video streaming app, Knocking, after the developers emailed Steve Jobs personally about its rejection. But that app only does one-to-one streaming, this does one-to-many — full-on broadcast.Find the Ustream Live Broadcaster in the App Store here for free.

Apple is making it more difficult for iPhone 4 owners to perform simple DIY repairs by replacing common Phillps head screws with a rare "pentalobe" screws. While newer iPhone 4s have included the screws from the factory, it is also Apple policy to replace any Phillips head screws with the new pentalobe screws whenever an iPhone 4 is taken in for service."This screw head clearly has one purpose," iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens told Ars. "To keep you out."News of the strange screw first started appearing last November, when users began noticing that serviced iPhone 4s had something other than Phillips head screws on them. 9to5Mac originally speculated that the screws were a form of Torx screw common to many Apple devices, but later noted that they were in fact some else entirely.iFixit discovered the odd screws much earlier, as iPhone 4s shipped to Japan on launch had the strange new screw. A little investigation revealed that "it is not a standard Torx, and there are no readily available screwdrivers that can remove it," Wiens said."[Apple] chose this 'pentalobe' fastener specifically because it was new, guaranteeing repair tools would be both rare and expensive," Wiens explained. He also noted that the screws are only used on the exterior of the device, merely to make it difficult for end users to get inside. "Otherwise," Wiens said, "Apple would use it throughout each device."Wiens said that Apple had used a similar screw on early unibody MacBook Pros to secure the integrated battery, but later adopted a tri-wing screw for that purpose. The latest MacBook Airs, however, also use pentalobe screws on the outside case, making it difficult to perform what would otherwise be a simple swap of the SSD, for instance.iFixit is doing what it can to source screwdrivers to work with the new screws, though it notes that there doesn't appear to be a single reputable supplier that carries the same tools Apple technicians use. The company offers a kit for iPhone 4 owners with a small driver than can remove the pentalobe screws along with replacement Phillips screws and #00 Phillips screwdriver. Wiens notes that the pentalobe driver isn't perfect—"the tip is more star-shaped than "flowery"—but it can remove Apple's pesky replacements and "liberate" your iPhone.For MacBook Air owners, iFixit also offers a "5-point" screwdriver that is also more star-shaped, but can remove the pentalobe screws Apple uses on the exterior case. Wiens told Ars that the larger size of the head means that the driver can also be used to screw the case back together without danger of damage to the screws (unlike the tiny ones used in the iPhone 4)."This is terrible for consumers," Wiens said. "Apple is taking planned obsolescence to the next level."

In the world of smartphones, two distinct camps have started to form. On the one side, you have the infamous Apple devotees. These folks like having a simple, neat and tightly controlled user experience; they like what Steve Jobs hands them, and they're OK with doing things the Apple way.Related BlogAndroid Power Author JR Raphael writes Computerworld's new Android Power blog. You can also find him on Twitter and Facebook.On the other side, you have the rapidly growing Android army. These users don't want to be locked into one phone, one design or one set of options. They appreciate being able to pick a mobile device that suits their needs -- and then being able to use it the way they want, installing the programs they choose and customizing the phone as they see fit.It's no surprise that more and more people are opting for the latter approach -- after all, who wants to pay good money for a piece of technology only to be restricted in how you can use it? The numbers speak volumes: A report released this week finds Android has officially become the top-selling smartphone platform in America, surpassing Apple in terms of global sales as well. Even the launch of the iPhone 4 (and Apple's accompanying attack-based antenna defense) has done little to dampen Android's momentum.Still, thanks to the wide range of choices, getting started with Android can be a bit overwhelming. That's why we've created this visual guide to the five finest Android phones you can find this summer. The devices are all top-of-the-line, and they all do everything an iPhone does and more.

A watchdog group is calling on Apple to demand improvements from its suppliers ahead of releasing its next iPhone. The group says it's already brought in 35,000 signatures.A new online petition is demanding that Apple clean up its act overseas in time to make its next iPhone "the first ethical iPhone."Watchdog group SumOfUs last week put up a petition asking Apple to "make the iPhone 5 ethically," referring to the company's use of overseas manufacturing from companies such as Foxconn, which have recently come under fire for their working conditions and practices.The petition, which the group says garnered more than 35,000 signatures in its first 24 hours, asks Apple to "overhaul the way its suppliers treat their workers," ahead of the release of its next smartphone, which is expected later this year."Can Apple do this? Absolutely," the petition reads. "According to an anonymous Apple executive quoted in The New York Times, all Apple has to do is demand it, and it'll happen."Overseas manufacturers came under fire last week with a pair of investigative stories published by The New York Times that lambasted Apple for poor worker labor and safety issues in its supplier facilities, as well as using cut-throat business practices that prohibited those manufacturers from making improvements.Apple did not respond to the reports in the press, though an internal memo from Apple CEO Tim Cook that leaked last week argued to employees that "any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us.""If Tim Cook is really offended by these allegations, why isn't he doing anything to fix the problems?" Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, executive director of SumOfUs, asked in a statement. "This is the supply chain he set up as COO--he needs to start taking responsibility, not blaming the messenger."This is the latest in a series of petitions targeting Apple, though it is less product-focused. One that launched early last year called on the company to remove a homophobic application from the App Store, a move that resulted in it getting pulled. Two others just a few months ago took aim at the company for the Siri voice assistant application on the iPhone 4S not being able to direct users towards an abortion clinic, which Apple referred to as a "glitch."

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

...for your own goodFree whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple has applied for a patent covering an elaborate series of measures to automatically protect iPhone owners from thieves and other unauthorized users. But please withhold the applause.The patent, titled “Systems and Methods for Identifying Unauthorized Users of an Electronic Device,” would also protect Apple against jailbreaks and other unauthorized hacks to the device, which were recently excepted from copyright enforcement.The application, which was filed in February and published Thursday, specifically describes the identification of “hacking, jailbreaking, unlocking, or removal of a SIM card” so that measures can be taken to counter the user. Possible responses include surreptitiously activating the iPhone's camera, geotagging the image and uploading it to a server and transmitting sensitive data to a server and then wiping it from the device.Rest assured that this jailbreaking identification, the application would have us believe, is simply a means of protecting owners from unauthorized users.“Access to sensitive information such as credit card information, social security numbers, banking information, home addresses, or any other delicate information can be prohibited,” the application states. “In some embodiments, the sensitive information can be erased from the electronic device. For example, the sensitive information can be erased directly after an unauthorized user is detected.”But elsewhere, the patent betrays ulterior motives that are considerably more self serving.“An activity that can detect an unauthorized user can be any action that may indicate the electronic device is being tampered with by being, for example, hacked, jailbroken, or unlocked,” the patent continues. “For example, a sudden increase in memory usage of the electronic device can indicate that a hacking program is being run and that an unauthorized user may be using the electronic device.“'Jailbreaking' of an electronic device can generally refer to tampering with the device to allow a user to gain access to digital resources that are normally hidden and protected from users. 'Unlocking' of a cellular phone can generally refer to removing a restriction that 'locks' a cellular phone so it may only be used in specific countries or with specific network providers. Thus, in some embodiments, an unauthorized user can be detected if it is determined that the electronic device is being jailbroken or unlocked.”The application describes plenty of bells and whistles. They include voice-printing of the owner to detect unauthorized users (what could possibly go wrong with that?), activating the accelerometer to detect if thieves are in transit – even a “heartbeat sensor.”Ignoring the possibility that a false positive in Apple's proposed theft protection might activate the spy cam while the user is in the bath, or in the middle of some other intimate moment, this technology seems Orwellian for another reason: It gives Steve jobs and Co. the means to retaliate when iPhones aren't being used in ways Cupertino doesn't expressly permit.But remember, it's for your own good. ®

The CES 2010 did not officially start yet, but the Parrot AR.Drone already made it on my short list of CES 2010 coolest products. The Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter piloted with an iPhone or iPod touch that carries two cameras that deliver live video feed onto your iPhone. How bloody cool is that? (watch video below). Parrot is positioning the Parrot AR.Drone as a video game for the iPhone. It combines wireless, video and gaming technologies to allow real-world objects and conditions, like a tree or wind, to become a part of the video gaming experience.Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter that consists of a central cockpit surrounded by four propellers. One camera located underneath, connects to an Inertial Measurement Unit, which allows the AR.Drone to measure its speed and perform flawless stationary flight. Parrot Smart Piloting (PSP) technology compensates for wind and other environmental conditions during outside flights. For the first time, these technologies, used primarily for professional and military applications, have been adapted to the gaming universe. The second camera, at the front, broadcasts and streams to the iPhone or iPod touch screen, what the AR.Drone sees, as if you were sitting in the cockpit. This allows for the augmented reality gaming experience. The Parrot AR.Drone generates its own Wi-Fi network that simply connects to an iPhone or iPod touch and turns it into a true piloting station. I am not even sure if the U.S. Army has a better drone than this. Pricing has not been announced yet for Parrot AR.Drone. I hope it will be below $200. Parrot launches the iPhone Drone later this year. The company is more known for Bluetooth gear, but with the AR.Drone they could land a huge hit. I certainly want a AR.Drone when it is out for my iPhone. See also these hi-res photos. Game developers are invited to creating games for the Parrot AR.Drone on the open platform that Parrot provides for it. More details can be found on the Parrot AR.Drone site.

More Google Android phones were sold during the first quarter of 2010 in the U.S. than iPhones. Customers of Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. carrier in terms of subscribers, can’t buy an iPhone, but they can choose from a wide range of different Google Android smartphones.More handsets sold in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010 were running atop Google’s Android than Apple’s iPhone operating system, according to the latest findings of The NPD Group. Android smartphones accounted for 28 percent of sales; the iPhone, just 21 percent (both still lagged behind Research In Motion’s BlackBerry platform, which was the market leader at 36 percent). So what’s propelling Android past the iPhone?There’s the obvious explanation: Exclusivity on AT&T’s network limits the potential sales for Apple. As Verizon announced on its most recent quarterly earnings call, it has more than 92.8 million subscribers, none of which can buy an iPhone for use on the network — although a recent poll found that a majority of them want one. Enter Google Android phones, whose user interfaces are similar to the iPhone and have access to a growing software store, now estimated at 50,000 applications. Verizon is helping the Android cause, too — it devoted $100 million in advertising muscle to back the Android-powered Motorola Droid.An additional factor is the number of handset choices. By providing its Android operating system to any hardware manufacturer that wants it, Google allows for a near limitless number of handset variances for consumers to choose from. iPhone selection, on the other hand, is akin to choosing the paint color of the old Ford Model T’s that only came in black — you can have any iPhone model you like right now, so long as it’s an iPhone 3G or 3GS.Finally, the many permutations of Android devices offers another advantage — pricing flexibility based on the hardware used and the features offered. The NPD Group cites an average smartphone price of $151 in the first quarter of 2010, roughly half of the $299 price tag for a top-shelf iPhone. Apple offers subsidized models at $99 and $199, but most subsidized Android phone prices top out at $199 and go down from there. The Samsung Behold 2 running Android is currently free with a service plan at T-Mobile, for example. With so many choices, consumers can find Android units for well under $99 these days and can shop around in a greater range of price points.

(CNN) -- Does a free case fix all the iPhone 4's problems?Not really, says Consumer Reports, the influential product watchdog.Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Friday announced that his company will give iPhone 4 owners free cases to address reception problems caused by the phone's external antenna, which is a metal band around the edge of the phone.Mike Gikas, senior editor for electronics and technology at Consumer Reports, said in an interview that such a patch is a good "first step." But it's still not enough for his group to recommend the phone to consumers."What we were hoping for was a concrete, this-is-it fix for the phone," Gikas said.Consumer Reports made headlines earlier this week for suggesting that iPhone 4 owners would get better phone reception if they put duct tape over the bottom left corner of the phone, where there was a "design flaw" in the antenna.In an effort to address widespread complaints, Apple said it will give a variety of iPhone 4 cases to consumers through September 30.Gikas said such a solution makes it difficult to review the phone, because everyone has a different case, and it's unclear if the solution is permanent; there's a chance the phone could still be recalled after September 30, or that a new version could be issued, he said."When we test a product we try to assume this product is just like all the others that came in boxes just like it," he said, "and we can't do that anymore [with the iPhone 4] because, with the case, this phone is different."During the press event in Cupertino, California, Jobs tried to spread the blame about reception issues across the smartphone industry as a whole.Gikas said that was a bit unfair."The human hand -- the body -- attenuates signal on all phones," he said. "But we haven't seen it happen to the degree that it's happened with the iPhone 4."Previously, Jobs had written an e-mail that said customers should hold the phone differently if they experienced poor reception.On Friday, Jobs skirted around saying there's a problem with the phone's hardware, Gikas said."The most important thing to remember is a problem was discovered with the phone and we can confirm it in a lab, and it was a significant problem," he said."And I don't think Apple fully admitted to it. They acknowledged it and they threw an interim solution at it. But everything spells fogginess about this thing."

Verizon has quietly begun throttling the wireless connections of its heaviest data users, the company revealed in a PDF buried on its website (hat tip to BGR). The document explains that Verizon has begun two new network management practices in order to "provide the best experience to our more than 94 million customers," and that they go into effect starting today, February 3.In the document, Verizon says it's using techniques such as caching less data on its network, reducing network capacity, and sizing video "more appropriately" for devices. "While we invest much effort to avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as displayed on your device," Verizon writes.The company also insists that the process is content-agnostic—likely to avoid the outrage that came when Comcast began throttling Bit Torrent users. Verizon's PDF points to www.verizonwireless.com/vzwoptimization for a more detailed explanation of its optimization "techniques," but as of this writing, that page remains unavailable on Verizon's site.Along with video compression, Verizon is now reducing data throughput speeds for customers that fall into the five percent of customers who "use an extraordinary amount of data." The throttling could last through the remainder of the current billing cycle and the next one, so those who find their data speeds being held back may end up suffering the consequences for months afterwards."Our proactive management of the Verizon Wireless network is designed to ensure that the remaining 95 percent of data customers aren't negatively affected by the inordinate data consumption of just a few users," the company wrote.The timing for Verizon's new throttling policies is no coincidence; today is also the day the carrier began accepting preorders for the long-awaited Verizon iPhone 4. Verizon will undoubtedly begin to feel the weight of iPhone users' browsing habits when the device becomes available to customers on February 10, just as AT&T did when the iPhone first launched on its network in 2007.It took AT&T years of building out its network to better handle the load, and Verizon knows that it needs to balance things out from the beginning. After all, a study from last July showed that Verizon 3G users gobbled about 25 percent more data than iPhone users did—now that Verizon's about to have its old customers and new iPhone users snarfing down data like no tomorrow, network management has apparently become a bigger priority.Another point of note is Verizon's position on the latest net neutrality rules. The company sued the Federal Communications Commission last month to block the rules from taking effect, even though they are comparatively light on wireless communications. Still, with the decision to throttle heavy data users, Verizon is obeying what's outlined in the FCC rules by making sure the implementation is site- and content-agnostic, as well as by being transparent about its practices. The company knows that the move isn't likely to be popular, so it's trying to offer as much information as it can so that users can understand better what's going on behind the scenes.

Michigan: Police Search Cell Phones During Traffic StopsACLU seeks information on Michigan program that allows cops to download information from smart phones belonging to stopped motorists.The Michigan State Police have a high-tech mobile forensics device that can be used to extract information from cell phones belonging to motorists stopped for minor traffic violations. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan last Wednesday demanded that state officials stop stonewalling freedom of information requests for information on the program.ACLU learned that the police had acquired the cell phone scanning devices and in August 2008 filed an official request for records on the program, including logs of how the devices were used. The state police responded by saying they would provide the information only in return for a payment of $544,680. The ACLU found the charge outrageous."Law enforcement officers are known, on occasion, to encourage citizens to cooperate if they have nothing to hide," ACLU staff attorney Mark P. Fancher wrote. "No less should be expected of law enforcement, and the Michigan State Police should be willing to assuage concerns that these powerful extraction devices are being used illegally by honoring our requests for cooperation and disclosure."A US Department of Justice test of the CelleBrite UFED used by Michigan police found the device could grab all of the photos and video off of an iPhone within one-and-a-half minutes. The device works with 3000 different phone models and can even defeat password protections."Complete extraction of existing, hidden, and deleted phone data, including call history, text messages, contacts, images, and geotags," a CelleBrite brochure explains regarding the device's capabilities. "The Physical Analyzer allows visualization of both existing and deleted locations on Google Earth. In addition, location information from GPS devices and image geotags can be mapped on Google Maps."The ACLU is concerned that these powerful capabilities are being quietly used to bypass Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches."With certain exceptions that do not apply here, a search cannot occur without a warrant in which a judicial officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the search will yield evidence of criminal activity," Fancher wrote. "A device that allows immediate, surreptitious intrusion into private data creates enormous risks that troopers will ignore these requirements to the detriment of the constitutional rights of persons whose cell phones are searched."The national ACLU is currently suing the Department of Homeland Security for its policy of warrantless electronic searches of laptops and cell phones belonging to people entering the country who are not suspected of committing any crime.

IPhone activations at AT&T (T) grew by just 3% in the second quarter this year, and many industry watchers pointed to the flood of next-generation iPhone rumors as a likely culprit for the slowed growth. BGR has exclusively learned that this is not entirely the case, however, and the stalled iPhone sales at the nation’s No.2 wireless carrier may in fact be by design.Updated with official statement from AT&T after the last paragraph.Regional retail sales managers at AT&T have been instructing store managers to pump the brakes on Apple’s iPhone. Instructions handed down from corporate state that customers seeking smartphones at AT&T retail stores should be steered away from Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone and towards Android phones or Windows Phone handsets like the Nokia Lumia 900 instead. BGR has confirmed the directive with three independent sources.Even when customers come into stores specifically looking for the iPhone 4S or iPhone 4, staffers have been instructed to make an effort to show people Android and Windows Phone devices as well, so they can “make an informed decision.” In addition, AT&T retail staff in at least some locations are no longer permitted to obtain iPhones as their company-owned devices, and must instead choose an Android smartphone or a Windows Phone.One source told BGR that Apple’s iPhone used to make up as much as 80% of smartphone sales at stores in his area, but that figure has dropped dramatically to between 50% and 60% since regional managers instructed stores to actively push other smartphones in place of the iPhone.Apple handsets still accounted for 72% of all smartphones activated by AT&T during the second quarter this year.UPDATE: AT&T contacted BGR via email and supplied the following statement:The idea that we would steer any customer away from a particular device couldn’t be more farfetched.  Our reps do what it takes to align customer needs with the best device for them.  iPhone remains one of our most popular devices, which doesn’t happen by steering people away from it. Our reps are encouraged to try all devices so they are more knowledgeable on our industry-leading smartphone lineup.

The phone maker plans to add Apple's recently unveiled iPhone 5 to its list of accused products, according to a report from Reuters.It appears that Apple's iPhone 5 isn't going to escape the ongoing legal battle with Samsung Electronics.Samsung said it would add the recently unveiled smartphone -- which has already seen record pre-sale figures and which will hit stores tomorrow -- to a list of products accused of violating its patents, according to Reuters, citing U.S. court documents.Samsung confirmed to CNET that it would pursue the iPhone 5.The two companies are in the midst of a bitter legal war over intellectual property. Apple recently scored a big victory over Samsung in a Federal court in San Jose, Calif., but the two companies have several existing lawsuits going on in different countries around the world.Samsung has already taken its case to consumers; the South Korean conglomerate released an ad yesterday slamming the iPhone 5 and people waiting in line for Apple products.Analysts, meahwhile, believe that the iPhone 5 could be poised for record sales spurred by pent-up demand from consumers who skipped the last refresh, the iPhone 4S.CNET has contacted Apple for comment, and we'll update the story when the company responds.Below is the filing from Samsung:Samsung filing

The UK's Advertising Standards Authority determined today that an Apple TV ad's claims about its iPhone 3G's relative download speeds is misleading and exaggerative, and must be pulled.The ASA received 17 complaints from television viewers who believed Apple's "So what's so great about 3G?" ad for the company's latest iPhone inaccurately portrayed the speed of the iPhone 3G. In the ad, Web pages are loaded in a fraction of a second with a voice-over stating (four times) that news, directions, and the Internet are each "really fast."According to the ASA, this ad violates three sections of the BCAP TV Advertising Code:5.2.1 "Licensees must obtain adequate objective evidence to support all claims ," (in this case, the accuracy of the portrayal of the 3G iPhone's speed.) 5.2.2 " Descriptions, claims and illustrations must not imply attributes, capabilities or performance beyond those that can be achieved in normal use." 5.4.1: "Advertisements must not use any technique that is likely to give a misleading or unfair impression of the product or service."Apple's response was that the ad was clearly comparing the 3G's speed against its 2G predecessor, and that the average viewer, as a mobile phone user, would understand the device's performance would vary. It said it reinforced that understanding by including the on-screen fine print, "Network performance will vary by location."The ASA, however, determined that there was no explicit comparison with the 2G iPhone, and that the visuals in combination with the repeated claim "really fast," was likely to mislead viewers. Therefore, it declared, the ad as seen here must no longer be aired in the UK, and must be altered or retired.

It can be easy to forget in the crush of the launch of an entirely new product like the iPhone 5, but Appleâ€™s quality control process is one of the most stringent in the world. While we gnash our teeth at pre-scratched units, yellow screens and purplish lens flares, itâ€™s worth keeping everything in perspective: minor aberrations in a pursuit of perfection wrought upon such a collossal scale of mass-production that the mind literally reels to think of it.Apple doesnâ€™t often lift the curtain, so we havenâ€™t really known what quality control processes it actually uses to get iPhones to our door in as perfect condition as possible. As it turns out, though, the process Apple uses is incredibly thorough and elegant, just what youâ€™d expect.A reader of AppleInsider wrote in to share with them a picture he found on his brand new iPhone 5 when he took it out of the box for the first time. The image contains a QR code and the Chinese symbol â€œå?œâ€? (which means â€œSTOPâ€?):At the end of the contiguous character string was an unknown â€œ65%â€? designation which appears to relate to the â€œ65% Fail/ä¸?è‰¯â€? line highlighted in red. Just above the percentage are the characters â€œLL/A,â€? most likely referring to the last three identifying digits of the iPhone 5â€²s MD63XLL/A order number.This iPhone 5, then, despite working properly, seems to have had some problem that failed Appleâ€™s quality control process. Despite this, when the recipient of this iPhone 5 contacted Apple, he was escalated to a senior manager at Apple Support who told him to just â€œdelete the picture and donâ€™t worry about itâ€? if the phone was operational.I really find this fascinating. It appears that Apple tracks every deviceâ€™s serial number from production to shipment, recording and stress testing every way that device can fail with quick efficiency. Presumably, that means that if later on, your iPhone develops a problem, they can take a look at the history of the device and see if there was any indication of the problem at the factory. Thatâ€™s very thorough.Read more at http://www.cultofmac.com/193155/how-apple-tracks-your-iphone-through-foxconn/#1DRck2bFAwMw5t7M.99

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19 (UPI) --Some iPhone owners have begun reporting a bug that has their handsets showing the wrong date and time, a U.S. tech website reports.The majority of complaints appear to be coming from Verizon iPhone subscribers, Tom's Hardware Guide reported Friday.Some iPhone owners are complaining about the date and time being off by a day, while others report dates off by as much as two weeks."Mine isn't just off by 30 min," one iPhone owner wrote on the Apple Support Communities website. "Today the black one was off by 15 days plus 6 hours and 12 minutes when I pulled it off the charger. The white one is my wife's and she complained yesterday evening that she had to fix the time four times throughout the day.""I've had the phone for about two weeks and have noticed the time drifting slowly off by 3-5 minutes," another user wrote. "Tonight [Tuesday] at 10:40 p.m. it changed itself to September 28th 4:35pm."Many of the complaining owners say the issue is occurring at their home, suggesting inconsistent WiFi or LTE coverage.Several purported fixes have been suggested by users, including changing the date and time updating from automatic to manual, turning off LTE, resetting the device or toggling the Airplane mode.

The Consumerist reports that one of its readers has been unable to buy an iPhone from AT&T’s online store. According to the report, an AT&T customer representative told him that “the phone is not offered to you because New York is not ready for the iPhone […] You don’t have enough towers to handle the phone.”The Consumerist obtained a written statement from AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook, in which Cook said “We periodically modify our promotions and distribution channels.”This story is being taken by many to be an attempt by the carrier to follow up on AT&T mobile boss Ralph de la Vega’s statement that “the company is […] working on getting the data hogs to cut down their usage,” while at the same time “pushing its wireless margins into the 40 percent range next year from around 38 percent in the third quarter.”Other reports are speculating about the possibilities of credit-card crime, and that the hold on online sales in NYC is a security measure to curb fraud through online purchases. This would make some sense, as the iPhone can still be bought in physical stores. In fact, simply refusing online orders from zip-codes where fraud is rife seems like a remarkably effective and elegant cure.What is certain is that AT&T’s lack of a quick response is causing it PR damage. A simple, clear statement of intent would have been enough to diffuse this story. Well, that and some new cell-towers in New York.Updated 1:30 p.m. PDT: AT&T.com has resumed selling iPhones to New York customers. The company has not provided a statement explaining the temporary suspension of online iPhone sales in New York.AT&T Customer Service: “New York City Is Not Ready For The iPhone” [Consumerist]Did AT&T pull the iPhone out of New York?

Fond of gender stereotypes? The study has you covered: women tweet more than men; gals tweet about family and fashion while guys tweet about tech and sports; women like purple backgrounds while men prefer dark ones.The most useful part of the study, however, is that it provides a good view of how ordinary people use Twitter. For instance, it reveals that 25 percent of Twitter users have never tweeted, the average number of followers is 208 and that 81 percent of users have fewer than 50 followers.This is a good reminder that most people don’t use Twitter in the same way as those of us in the media-politics-tech-celebrity-sports bubble. It also appears to confirm BuzzFeed’s John Herman’s theory that “Your Twitter followers aren’t fake, they’re just shy.”It will be interesting to see how Twitter reaches out to this passive population going forward. I’ve tried to persuade family and friends that Twitter is simply a great news service but they’re skeptical. They think, understandably, that Twitter is a club for loud mouths and ask me, “what would I tweet?”As for the study, Beevolve CEO Goldee Udani said by email that the firm was “curious about the demographic make up of Twitter user base, topics that Twitter users found interesting at a macro level and how dense was the Twitter social graph compared to known statistics about Facebook.”You can see the full study, which is presented in clear language and graphics, here.

Mozilla is now actively backing a movement that, if successful, would essentially nullify copyright infringement charges against individuals that ‘jailbreak’ their Apple iPhones – a practice that Apple considers illegal.Mozilla, the makers of the widely popular open source browser project Firefox, said in comments submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office that it supports the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in its request for an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The EFF wants the Copyright Office to let users ‘jailbreak’ their iPhones without fear of copyright infringement issues.Apple naturally opposes this request claiming that the act of ‘jailbreaking’ an Apple iPhone is in direction violation of copyright laws which protect its software. “Jailbreak” is a term given to the processes involved to circumvent the digital rights management (DRM) technology on the Apple iPhone so that users may install third-party applications not authorized by Apple or the mobile carrier. The term ‘jailbreak’ was pioneered by iPhone owners but has since made its way into the entire cellular world for all types of handsets.Although Mozilla made no direct mention of the iPhone by name in its comments, it is quite obvious who they were targeting, discreetly. Nearly all other handset manufacturers and mobile carriers do not carry the same restrictive measures that Apple imposes on iPhone owners.Quoting Mozilla CEO John Lilly from a previous interview with another source on Monday :“This is not us criticizing Apple,  but it’s the principle of the thing. Choice is good for users, and choice shouldn’t be criminalized. The Internet is too important for all of us for that”"By controlling the software that can be installed on these cellular phones, these companies can limit and control the type of programs and functionality that is available to users of their devices."Anderson feels as though the usage of DRM as a way to prevent people from installing software to their devices has a ‘chilling effect on users and innovation’, users become afraid to make use of their devices to their potential because it is deemed illegal. Anderson also continued on to argue that smartphones are akin to a desktop computer because they can be used to access the Internet, and users should have free choice to use any software program they choose to access.

Computerworld - Hackers can exploit a flaw in Adobe's Flash to compromise nearly every Web site that allows users to upload content, including Google's Gmail, then launch silent attacks on visitors to those sites, security researchers said today.Adobe did not dispute the researchers' claims, but said that Web designers and administrators have a responsibility to craft their applications and sites to prevent such attacks."The magnitude of this is huge," said Mike Murray, the chief information security officer at Orlando, Fla.-based Foreground Security. "Any site that allows user-uploadable content is vulnerable, and most are not configured to prevent this."The problem lies in the Flash ActionScript same-origin policy, which is designed to limit a Flash object's access to other content only from the domain it originated from, added Mike Bailey, a senior security researcher at Foreground. Unfortunately, said Bailey, if an attacker can deposit a malicious Flash object on a Web site -- through its user-generated content capabilities, which typically allow people to upload files to the site or service -- they can execute malicious scripts in the context of that domain."This is a frighteningly bad thing," Bailey said. "How many Web sites allow users to upload files of some sort? How many of those sites serve files back to users from the same domain as the rest of the application? Nearly every one of them is vulnerable."Bailey, who demonstrated how attackers could compromise a Web site and attack users in a post today on Foreground's blog, outlined how a hacker would leverage the Flash flaw. "It's relatively simple," he maintained. "All they need to do is create a malicious Flash object, and upload it to the [Web] server."He used the example of a company that lets users upload content to a message forum to explain the process. "If the user forum lets people upload an image for their avatar, someone could upload a malicious Flash file that looks like an avatar image," Bailey said. "Anyone who then views that avatar would be vulnerable to attack."Adobe has told Foreground that the flaw is "unpatchable," Murray and Bailey said. Instead, Adobe is trying to educate site administrators to close the hole on their end. But they've not had much success.Brad Arkin, Adobe's director for product security and privacy, agreed that the problem can't be solved with a patch to Flash. "We see this as a generic problem that affects any site that allows active scripting, not just Flash, but things like JavaScript and Silverlight as well. Even if Flash figured out some magical safeguard, this would be true for all active content sites that allow users to upload files."

We reported yesterday about Apple’s alleged delay in payments to iPhone app developers, but there is more alarming news from iPhone developers about Apple’s refund policies. Apparently, if iPhone users decide that they want a refund for an app (users can get a refund within 90 days, according to Apple policy), Apple requires that developers give back the money they received from the sale. But here’s the kicker—Apple will refund the full amount to the user and says that it has the right to keep its commission. So the developer not only has to return the money for the sale, but also has to reimburse Apple for its commission. Apple charges a 30% commission on all paid apps sold through the App Store. So basically, developers get 70% of a given sale but if the end-user wants a refund, the developer has to pay Apple 100% of the sale.Here’s the clause in the contract:In the event that Apple receives any notice or claim from any end-user that: (i) the end-user wishes to cancel its license to any of the Licensed Applications within ninety (90) days of the date of download of that Licensed Application by that end-user; or (ii) a Licensed Application fails to conform to Your specifications or Your product warranty or the requirements of any applicable law, Apple may refund to the end-user the full amount of the price paid by the end-user for that Licensed Application. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an end-user, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that Licensed Application. Apple will have the right to retain its commission on the sale of that Licensed Application, notwithstanding the refund of the price to the end.The developer we spoke to seemed to think that the app would become unusable if a consumer gets a refund for a particular application, but the developer was unclear if this actually happens. We were also told that this section of the contract is new, and developers are being forced to sign this in order to sell apps in the next generation App Store (for when the iPhone OS 3.0 is officially released). But we saw a contract from another iPhone developer who signed the agreement back in December and the same clause was part of the contract.We are assuming that Apple still has to pay bank fees on a charge if a consumer wants a refund, but certainly bank charges don’t amount to 30 percent. This policy still seems incredibly unfair to developers. Apple should instead require developers to return the exact amount they received from a refunded sale, not extra. Apple has a ton of money in the bank and could stand to make a lot more from the app store down the line as the iPhone user base grows. With these fees, Apple is pointing a big red arrow at why developers shouldn’t be developing for the iPhone—namely, they’re at the mercy of Apple, which is making a habit of treating its developers like dirt.

A teardown by IHS iSuppli shows Apple updated most components in the latest device and included some new suppliers.Apple is sticking with most of its component providers for the latest iPhone, an IHS iSuppli teardown shows, but it has made some "critical changes" and updated most chips.A physical teardown by IHS, released today, shows Apple is using parts from many of the usual suspects -- Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Murata, Dialog, Texas Instruments, STMicro, Cirrus Logic, Avago, Skyworks, NXP and AKM.But it also has made some additions, like flash memory maker SanDisk, and almost every component has been updated. And IHS' supplier list indicates a reduced reliance on Samsung, the chip and handset maker that Apple has been battling in court."The iPhone 5 exhibits a great deal of similarity to the iPhone 4S in terms of component suppliers," IHS analyst Andrew Rassweiler said in a statement. "But beyond this superficial resemblance, there are some critical changes to product design and parts that enable major upgrades that improve user experience."Some of those changes include a bigger display and a faster applications processor. And the device uses a 4G LTE chip from Qualcomm that has implications for the iPhone 5 design. Because LTE is more complex, Apple had to create two different models of the newest iPhone to accommodate its wireless carrier partners, IHS says. It only offered a single model for the 4S.Perhaps the biggest winner for the new iPhone -- besides Apple itself -- is SanDisk, which isn't believed to have been a supplier for previous iPhone models. That earlier missed opportunity had hurt the company while rivals like Samsung benefited from their exposure to Apple.Along with flash, the teardown also revealed a different dynamic random access memory supplier than in IHS' 4S analysis -- Elpida. The Japanese DRAM maker is in the process of being bought by rival Micron following Elpida's recent bankruptcy filing. IHS' teardown of the 4S named Samsung as the DRAM supplier, though other analyses have listed Elpida as another memory supplier.It's likely Apple is sourcing DRAM and flash memory from multiple suppliers. IHS notes Samsung, Hynix and Toshiba could be providing flash for certain phones, while Apple could also be buying DRAM from Samsung and Hynix.In other changes, Sony now supplies the battery in the newest iPhone, rather than Amperex Tech like in the iPhone 4S.A preliminary, virtual teardown by IHS last week showed the 16GB version of the iPhone 5 costs $199 for Apple to make, slightly more than the iPhone 4S. The tech research firm today says its physical teardown confirms that cost. Meanwhile, a teardown of Apple's A6 applications processor by iFixit and Chipworksshows the chip to be Apple's first custom-designed processor. Based on ARM Holdings' instruction set, the A6 has two processing cores and three graphics cores.The site also notes that the logic blocks in the chip were likely laid out by hand rather than by using advanced computer software as is typical for most chips today. A manual layout usually results in faster processing speeds, but it's much more expensive and time consuming, iFixit says."It just might be the only manual layout in a chip to hit the market in several years," the site noted.Updated at 12:05 p.m. PT with A6 teardown details from iFixit/Chipworks

Google's Android OS has gained an astonishing 7 points of market share in the US smartphone market in the past three months, Comscore saysRIM's market share over the same period collapsed, dropping almost 5 points.Apple's iPhone share increased slightly, but is dead in the water and has now fallen way behind Android (in smartphones).(If you include iPod touches in the calculation,Apple's share has actually fallen).Android now has a third of the US market (33%). RIM's share has plummeted to 29%. Apple is holding at 25%.In the "also ran" category, Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 did nothing to stop its decline, which fell from 9% to 7.7%. And Palm, which is barely worth mentioning anymore, fell another point to 2.8%.Why do the Android gains matter? Are Apple bulls right that Apple has an insurmountable hold on the "premium" segment of the market and that it doesn't matter who has the other 75%?The Android gains matter because technology platform markets tend to standardize around a single dominant platform (see Windows in PCs, Facebook in social, Google in search). And the more dominant the platform becomes, the more valuable it becomes and the harder it becomes to dislodge. The network effect kicks in, and developers building products designed to work with the platform devote more and more of their energy to the platform. The reward for building and working with other platforms, meanwhile, drops, and gradually developers stop developing for them.Importantly, it's not a question of which platform is "better." (This is irrelevant.) It's a question of which platform everyone else uses.  And increasingly, in the smartphone market, barring a radical change in trend, that's Android.So that's why Android's gains matter. And, yes, Apple fans should be scared to death about them.Apple is fighting a very similar war to the one it fought--and lost--in the 1990s. It is trying to build the best integrated products, hardware and software, and maintain complete control over the ecosystem around them. This end-to-end control makes it easier for Apple to build products that are "better," but it makes it much harder for the company to compete against a software platform that is standard across many hardware manufacturers (Windows in the 1990s, Android now).As we explain here, two important things are different about the current Android - iPhone battle than the Mac - Windows war in the 1990s. First, Apple is maintaining price parity (or better) with the leading Android phones. (Macs always cost more than PCs). Second, Android is still a fragmented platform, which significantly reduces the benefits of "interoperability" across multiple manufacturers.Google is working to fix the second problem, though--enacting much tighter rules about how Android can be used. And if the platform is to become dominant and ubiquitous, it will likely continue to tighten these rules.And Apple's price parity certainly does not appear to have stopped the Android juggernaut.The unit and platform numbers below, which show the change in market share from November to February, are not unit sales in the month. They are total usage stats, showing how the platform usage shifted over the period.So these Android gains should scare the bejeezus out of Apple bulls -- and Apple itself. And Apple's decision to not release the iPhone 5 in June will likely exacerbate rather than slow this trend.Here's the US handset share, by manufacturer:And US smartphone platform share (this is the key one):And, relatedly, a look at what folks are doing with their handsets these days:

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple’s iPhone 4 hasn’t even hit its one-month anniversary yet, but the company has already issued a software update that might fix the death grip problem affecting the device’s antenna.However, despite the fact that iOS 4.1 was made available to developers late yesterday, the Cupertino outfit is keeping quiet until Friday, when it will hold a press conference about the iPhone 4.The update itself has reportedly magnified the phone’s signal bars by making them taller. Whether this actually resolves what many have described as purely a hardware problem remains to be seen.Two weeks ago Apple coughed to a glitch with the way the signal bars are displayed on various iterations of its iPhone that can lead to dramatic drops in reception and bandwidth.The company said it was gobsmacked to have discovered the software flaw, and confirmed it would issue an update within a few weeks.Apparently, by lengthening the signal bars this almighty glitch ought to vanish, but perhaps iPhone 4 owners should sprinkle a little bit of angel dust on the slinky beast too, just for good measure.Meanwhile, until tomorrow (maybe) iPhone punters will be none the wiser about whether iOS 4.1 has saved the device from the evil death grip. That’s because developers sign a non-disclosure agreement with Apple that means details about what’s baked into the update will remain out of the public domain.So, iPhone 4 users, have your signal bars sprouted? Tell us all about it in comments. ®

Shortly after the iPhone 5 was released, some users began to complain that a purple flare appeared on pictures taken with the camera whenever it was pointed toward a bright light. Now, Apple is publicly acknowledging the problem with a response posted to its support page online:Most small cameras, including those in every generation of iPhone, may exhibit some form of flare at the edge of the frame when capturing an image with out-of-scene light sources. This can happen when a light source is positioned at an angle (usually just outside the field of view) so that it causes a reflection off the surfaces inside the camera module and onto the camera sensor. Moving the camera slightly to change the position at which the bright light is entering the lens, or shielding the lens with your hand, should minimize or eliminate the effect.Apple suggests in the response that flares can pop up on the edge of pictures taken with any iPhone â€” not just the iPhone 5 â€” though as you can see in the pictures Mashable took above, it appears that only the iPhone 5 has a purple flare. In any case, the solution Apple offers for any iPhone is simply to minimize the cameraâ€™s exposure to the bright light causing the flare.This is the third big complaint Apple has been forced to address publicly about the iPhone in the past two weeks. First, users complained about the quality of Appleâ€™s maps application for iOS 6, which eventually prompted the companyâ€™s CEO Tim Cook to issue an apology. Then, users complained that the new iPhone scuffs easily, which prompted the companyâ€™s SVP of marketing Phil Schiller to respond, noting that itâ€™s â€œnormal.â€?Are you satisfied with Appleâ€™s response? Let us know in the comments.

I just got off the phone with AT&T to figure out my iPhone data plans for the next month.I'm on a family plan, which can be a great discount on the iPhone if you upgrade from your family plan to an iPhone. You only play $9.99 for voice on the additional lines, which is basically a steal. I've had the unlimited data plan since I got my iPhone 3G 2 years ago and assumed that the unlimited data plan also applied to the two non-iPhones in the family plan.So I talk to an unlucky AT&T representative and tried to dissect the possibilities for when I get my iPhone next week:Option 1 I upgrade and keep my current plan Still keep my $30 unlimited plan No tetheringOption 2 I upgrade and change my data plan Change to the 2 gig, $25 plan and add tethering for $10 a month moreSo either I get as much data as I want the way I want to use it, or I get to use my data the way I want, get less and pay more for it.If anyone at AT&T is stupid enough to wonder why people don't like them, they really need to look at money grabs like this.

Last summer, when Apple pulled third-party Google Voice applications from the App Store, one of them was VoiceCentral. Apple’s subsequent rejection of the official Google Voice app spurred an FCC investigation, but Google Voice never made it to the app store and none of the other apps ever made it back in.Well, that’s not stopping the developers Riverturn, the company behind VoiceCentral. They are bringing back their app to the iPhone via the browser. They call it the Black Swan edition. You can get on a waiting list to be on the private beta here. The app is completely browser-based but has the look and feel of a regular app, complete with a dialer, list of transcribed voicemails, and SMS messages.When you dial a number, Google Voice simply makes a call to your iPhone while simultaneously calling the number of the person you are trying to reach, so you still pay for the voice minutes. But the appeal of having Google Voice on your iPhone is the ability to read transcribed voicemails, or play them, and avoid SMS charges by texting through Google Voice. (You cannot yet do all of these things when you access Google Voice via the iPhone’s browser directly).The downside is that it cannot access your contact list on your iPhone through the browser. Although, VoiceCentral mimics the look and feel of the iPhone contact manager, you have to export your contacts to Google Voice first and access them that way. Another limitation is that the audio plays through the speaker instead of through the earpiece, but if you are using a pair of earphones that is not a problem.VoiceCentral will probably be a paid app, but Apple won’t get any of the revenues since it is simply a mobile Website. It even offers offline caching and takes advantage of the HTML5 features of mobile Safari. This could very well be the future of mobile apps. As mobile browsers become more capable, more and more developers are going to ask themselves why bother with the limitations of the App Store and be at the mercy of Apple’s whims? And it won’t just be developers like VoiceCentral who have no other choice.Below is a promotional video which shows some of the features of VoiceCentral’s Black Swan app. Remember, this is all happening in the browser:

Skype may be announcing an application for the iPhone next week at the CTIA tradeshow in Las Vegas, claims tech blogger Om Malik of GigaOM. A few months ago, Om Malik asked Skype CEO Josh Silverman when the company was going to launch an iPhone version of the P2P voice and IM service that is available for other platforms. Silverman simply responded by saying, “Stay tuned.” At CES in January, Scott Durchslag, Skype’s chief operating officer, also confirmed an iPhone version of the software client would be coming to the App store, but said Skype would wait to release the software until it was perfect.Although Skype hasn’t commented on the rumors and is keeping mum on any upcoming announcements, the company is holding a press conference on Tuesday afternoon before the show kicks off. This would clearly be the perfect time for Skype to announce an iPhone client.Skype views mobile as the next major growth area for its business. The company expects that many of its 405 million registered users will take their Skype experience on the go. The company also believes it will be able to reach new users via mobile devices.Skype’s peer-to-peer service uses the Internet to carry voice traffic. While many cell phone plans in the U.S. include domestic long-distance calling for free, subscribers calling outside the U.S. can experience rates as high as $2 per minute unless they have a special monthly plan for placing international calls. This latter market segment is where Skype becomes appealing: The Skype mobile client would enable users to make inexpensive international calls on their cell phone rather than being tied to a computer.Skype is already available for Windows Mobile phones. Nokia plans to embed some of its phones with Skype clients as well. A Skype-lite version of the client is also available for some Java phones.If the rumors are true, iPhone users could soon be taking advantage of their phone’s Internet capabilities to place international calls. There’s likely to be a catch, however: The new Skype app for the iPhone may be limited to Wi-Fi networks only. Apple has limited other third-party services such as Fring in the past, so we wouldn’t be too surprised if Apple limits Skype as well.

Although in numbers it lags behind Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, the Opera web browser is known for having a devoted fanbase. Opera has made inroads into gaming consoles and mobile platforms including the Wii, Nintendo DS, and approximately 40 million cell phones. So, you'd imagine that Opera would be a perfect match to the iPhone.Unfortunately, Apple thinks otherwise. A New York Times story from this week says that an iPhone version of Opera failed to make it past Apple's gatekeeper, "[Founder Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner] said that Opera's engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone, but Apple won't let the company release it because it competes with Apple’s own Safari browser," the Times wrote.Opera is known for being fast and secure, as well as accessible to a wide range of users. The mobile version of Opera can dynamically reformat web pages to better fit handheld displays using the company's small screen rendering technology. And, even though Opera representatives state that this rejection was due to duplicated functionality, Opera would have had a tough time getting through a different gate: Apple will not allow programs to interpret code. Opera, being a full-featured browser, interprets JavaScript downloaded from the Internet, an absolute App Store no-no.This isn't the first time that Apple has rejected software for duplicating core functionality. In September, Apple said no to MailWrangler, a program that simplified accessing multiple Gmail accounts. Around the same time, the company also declined to host Al Sokirynsky's Podcaster app, which allowed users to download podcasts and play them on the iPhone. Because of this, we don't find Opera's rejection particularly surprising, although it is a bit disappointing. Mobile Safari is a great mobile platform, but it would have been nice to have an iPhone version of Opera to play around with. Update: Gruber says the app probably wasn't even submitted.

If anyone taught us the importance of numbers, it was Apple.I don’t know that bloody iPhones and skull icons are the best way to make an argument for more ethical labor policies at factories like Foxconn. And the name “iKill” is just as tacky as it is ineffective at evoking some sort of meaningful emotional response.But numbers? Numbers are powerful things. If anyone taught us that, it was Apple and its contemporaries, hawking gadgets that were twice as fast, half as thin.Do you remember that moment in Harry Potter, when that first amazing feast just appeared on the banquet tables of Hogwarts? Ron practically wet himself in anticipation of his first full belly after years of fighting over scraps at the Weasley dinner table. A skeptic might say it was all too good to be true--how could amazing food just appear--but this was the world of Harry Potter. It was magic.Then in book two, you learned, it wasn’t magic at all! There were just a lot of hard working elves working countless hours to make the whole spectacle possible, and as much as we all loved the late Dumbledore, he was as responsible as anyone for turning a blind eye.That’s where we are now with Apple. The story has gotten less fun, but finally, we can grow up.However magical Apple’s products might be, magic doesn’t exist in this world. Industrial production is an exhausting, horribly paying job by the standards of anyone reading this. Apple isn’t the only Foxconn customer by any stretch, but they are the largest, richest, and most lauded. If Apple is taking it on the chin, it’s only because they have the biggest and, at times, smuggest chin of them all.Stay hungry? Yes. Stay foolish? Sure. But absolutely, stay disgusted, too. Stay angry.Because with $108 billion in revenue a year, Apple has every meaningful resource to make things, not just better, but better than ever. And maybe, just maybe, a company like Apple can do something truly great: make us all believe in magic again.

The glass screens of the iPhone 4 reportedly shatter at a rate 82% higher than earlier versions of the phone. This led consumers to bring a lawsuit claiming that Apple ads boasting about the glass were deceptive. The consumers are for now out of luck.A federal judge in San Jose threw out a class action lawsuit from iPhone 4 owners who claimed that Apple misrepresented the strength of the phone’s glass.The lawsuit was brought by California man Betsalel Williamson who had to replace the screen of his brand new iPhone after he knocked it off the arm of a chair, resulting “in spider cracks across the back glass panel.”In his ruling handed down this week, US District Judge Edward Davila wrote that “it is a well known fact of life that glass can break under impact” and said the iPhone owners failed to show that Apple breached a warranty or violated California’s consumer protection laws.The lawsuit argued that Apple ads touting the glass as “20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic . . . ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever” were misleading. It cited a study that the glass on the iPhone 4 breaks at a 82% higher rate than earlier iPhones, forcing consumers to to pay $29 to replace a cracked screen and $199 if the glass housing breaks.Judge Davila didn’t buy the claims, however, and wrote that Steve Jobs’ claims about the glass were “mere puffery” rather than a promise that could be the basis of a lawsuit:The judge noted in several other parts of the ruling that a phone without a case was more vulnerable.Davila gave permission for the plaintiffs to amend the complaint in order to show how specifically Apple deceived them.The judge’s ruling, which was first reported by Law360 (sub. req’d), is below with relevant portions underlined:

We all suspected it, but now it is confirmed: someone very, very close to the 3G iPhone launch has told me that Apple will announce their new model at the WWDC Keynote on June 9th. The second-generation iPhone will be available worldwide right after the launch (the worldwide release date is July 11, starting at $199) and not at year's end, as previously thought. The new model will also herald new sales policies in some countries.In Spain, for example, the 3G iPhone will be available for sale at the June 18th (according to our sources, the release date was changed at the last moment by Apple, and it's now July 11) grand opening of Telefonica's megastore—an Apple Store-like shop located in the company's historical building in Madrid's Gran Vía— with nationwide availability the next day or after a few hours. The other European countries with iPhone availability will have similar launch schedules.According to another source involved in the launch, the 3G iPhone will no longer be available at a fixed price point—at least in some countries, and its launch will also bring new sales policies, although these have not been completely specified yet.The move is a logical step, since the iPhone has clearly solidified its position as the cellphone to beat during the last 12 months, and companies in the cutthroat European cellphone market need to use it as an incentive to capture clients aggressively.This most probably means the new 3G iPhone will be integrated in the usual marketing systems of carriers, with point-based trade-ups, discounts for carrier switchers and other service-based subvention packages.

The first rule of the iPhone developer program is: You do not talk about the iPhone developer program.Before you create software for the iPhone, Apple demands that you sign away a laundry list of rights, including the ability to sell rejected apps through other channels, the ability to sue Apple for more than $50, and the ability to reverse-engineer or modify the iPhone or its SDK — and even the right to talk about your agreement with Apple.The iPhone Developer Program License Agreement (.pdf) spells out all these requirements and more. Previously secret, the agreement has been acquired and published with the help of the Freedom of Information Act.The Electronic Frontier Foundation reported Monday evening that it gained access to a March 2009 version of the agreement. EFF noticed that NASA had developed an iPhone app, so the cyber-rights foundation then used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the agreement from NASA. The space agency judged that the FOIA trumps the Apple agreement, so they turned the Apple document over to EFF.The contents of the agreement are hardly surprising, The EFF’s Fred von Lohmann summed up the highlights:“If Apple’s mobile devices are the future of computing, you can expect that future to be one with more limits on innovation and competition … than the PC era that came before,” von Lohmann wrote. “It’s frustrating to see Apple, the original pioneer in generative computing, putting shackles on the market it (for now) leads.”Though the agreement may appear one-sided, Apple’s nondisclosure agreement for developers was more strict when the App Store first opened. Apple imposed a nondisclosure agreement in 2008 forbidding developers to discuss developing for iPhone OS 2.0. Developers were turned off by the NDA, because it stifled them from discussing programming tips with one another. Apple later dropped this part of the nondisclosure agreement, saying its purpose was to protect its intellectual property.

The application is already available for a number of smartphones US telecoms giant AT&T has admitted that it struck a deal with Apple to prevent iPhone applications from using its network for VoIP. VoIP allows voice calls to be routed over mobile internet but reduces a network operator's voice call revenue. Apple and AT&T both responded to a federal inquiry into Apple's failure to approve Google Voice, a VoIP application for the iPhone. Apple said that the app had not been rejected but is still under review. In July, Apple rejected Google's application for the Google Voice app to be sold in its App Store, and removed several third-party applications that employed the same technology. The app is already available on Blackberrys and phones that run both Google's Android and the Symbian operating system. Apple's move prompted an inquiry from the US's Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In AT&T's response to the FCC, the firm said that "AT&T and Apple agreed that Apple would not take affirmative steps to enable an iPhone to use AT&T's wireless service (including 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi) to make VoIP calls without first obtaining AT&T's consent". However, it added that the firms had agreed that "if a third party enables an iPhone to make VoIP calls using AT&T's wireless service, Apple would have no obligation to take action against that third party". AT&T argued that the deal was struck because "both parties required assurances that the revenues from the AT&T voice plans available to iPhone customers would not be reduced by enabling VoIP calling functionality on the iPhone". In its letter to the FCC, Apple said that several VoIP applications such as Skype had already been approved for use over wi-fi wireless networks, rather than over the cellular network. However, it added that the Google Voice app was still under scrutiny because it could "alter the iPhone's distinctive user experience", but added that Google Voice could be accessed via the iPhone's web browser. In its reply to the FCC inquiry, Google argued that "the Google Voice features accessible by the mobile website are more limited than those features found in the App Store version". Those features include direct access to the phone's contact list, or dialling directly from the application.

Just when we thought it was almost over, we realize the party has only just started. New reports today are clearly stating that while Samsung might have lost the battle, in the end they’ll win the war. According to the Korean Times Samsung holds just over 10% of all 4G LTE (long term evolution) patents and is prepared to play some offense of their own in the courtroom.What we are now hearing is that Samsung is basically saying “We dare you” to release a 4G LTE iPhone — which is rumored to be a part of the next iPhone launch — and once they do Samsung will sue the pants off of them and go into full revenge/attack mode. The iPad currently has LTE, yes, but Samsung has been waiting for a much bigger fish and that is Apple’s bread and butter – the iPhone.Sadly just this afternoon a story came out regarding Apple and Google themselves having private discussions to end these drawn out and angry patent lawsuits — but it appears that Samsung wants nothing to do with that. Obviously these reports can’t be confirmed at this time but we are hearing some reliable information is at hand regarding this.This is actually a very interesting development in this entire story. If Apple does launch an LTE iPhone (which is pretty likely) they’ll quickly be rounding up the troops once more and headed to court. Samsung will no doubt seek an immediate product injunction and ban from the US, and probably multiple other countries as their patents are very wide. Now obviously Apple needs to release an iPhone 5 with 4G LTE as that is something consumers are basically demanding these days. If they do they will get sued, and if they don’t then people will jump for the Android LTE options available.The new iPhone should be announced sometime in mid September so we’ll all know soon enough. Will this ever end?

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureiPhone customers are struggling to install Apple’s latest software patch and have been grumbling about the problems on Cupertino’s support forums.The company released its iOS 4.0.1 update yesterday, and immediately some users began complaining that they couldn’t successfully install it on their iPhones.“On a Win7 PC. Plugged the iPhone 4 in this morning and told there's an update. Ran it, and it errored during the install - I now have a brick. Now had to do a full restore, and I guess I'll have to try again,” wrote a UK punter with the handle DiscoRobbo on Apple’s forum this morning.“So far I've had to restore to factory settings (successfully and now on 4.0.1), but now the phone is having to resync ALL my data - which will take a while,” DiscoRobbo added later.Many customers have been reporting firmware problems with the update, which keeps spewing out ‘error 9’ messages.iPhone customer PaulDev said that an Apple rep gave him the following explanation for what had gone wrong.“Error 9: This error occurs when the device unexpectedly drops off of the USB bus and communication stops. This can occur if the device is manually disconnected during the restore process. This issue can be resolved by performing USB isolation troubleshooting, using a different USB dock connector cable, trying another USB port, restoring on another computer, or by eliminating conflicts from third-party security software.”“Maybe you touched the USB cable in the lower left corner. ‘Don't hold it that way’, okay? Apparently flaky mobile signals weren't enough, with 4.01, they've upgraded wired connections to have the same brilliant reliability was wireless,” he said.Having read the forum gripes some decided to altogether steer clear of Apple’s update.“After reading 8 pages of #applefail I think I will hold off updating for now and wait for today's press conference. Pls note however my apple bumper does not solve the reception drop issue,” said georgeyoung on Apple’s forum.Apple has remained characteristically quiet about this latest in a series of complaints from unhappy fanbois disappointed with their iPhone 4 devices.The company will be holding a press conference later today about the iPhone 4. It's been reported that Apple won't be recalling the slinky beast, despite the antenna problems that may have prompted the quick iOS 4.0.1 update release yesterday. ®

Does Japan hate the iPhone as much as Wired thinks it does? No, say local experts Nobi Hayashi and Daiji Hirata, who were somewhat misquoted by Brian Chen in his article.Though the quotes were accurate, Chen lifted them from other items earlier published by Wired. Their decontextualized words may agree with the storyâ€™s position, but it turns out that Hayashi and Hirata do not.This is why one has to be careful when refrying old quotes.If at first it seems like fair turnaround, however, donâ€™t hold your breath. Exciting in principle, Chenâ€™s offenses turn out to be unbelievably trivial. Neither source is important to the article: buried near the end, their quotes describe phone features that are popular in Japan.Far more interesting is the rage of Apple fans, who pounced onto these ethereal misrepresentations to denounce the author.Edible Apple imagines that the article is â€œlargely basedâ€? on a quote in the twelfth paragraph. iPhone Asia calls it a â€œhit pieceâ€œ. One blogger takes an unseemly interest in racist remarks aimed at Chen.Best of all, though, is Apple Insiderâ€˜s epic deconstruction of the story. A masterpiece, it is fully five times as long as Chenâ€™s original. In the first paragraph, subject-verb pairs tumble over themselves like puppies scampering down a hillside:A report intending to portray the iPhone as â€œhatedâ€? in the Japanese market turns out to have been built upon fake quotations from industry writers and observers who were misrepresented by remarks attributed to them that they never made.Though I fear this illustrates why one should never write when angry, an overwhelming sense of kinship with author Prince McLean remains. McLean obviously feels exactly how I feel when people talk smack about Apple. Denounce the lies! But do it in measured, even steps!And so at the cost of reminding the world that we Apple fans are completely mad, we unravel the questionable provenance of two peripheral remarks, fished out of the archives to pad a story to the required 600 words.Meanwhile, the iPhone is still not (Update: yet!) a hit in Japan.Writers fuck up because of deadlines, not because they are party to schemes to destroy your favorite companies. The proper way to deflate our errors is with wit. Dig the knife deep and hard. In, out. You win.See how Hayashi himself did it:I have to thank Brian X. Chen for helping me diet.Boom! Itâ€™s not even his first language.Apple Insiderâ€˜s response, in contrast, does not end until it has traversed a continent of systematic wrath: itâ€™s nearly 3,000 words long. Thatâ€™s almost as long as Februaryâ€™s issue of Wired! Itâ€™s laced with recriminations aimed at Chen and â€œmediaâ€? who aim â€œfierce assaultsâ€? at Apple. This is my favorite:Hayashiâ€™s reply, sent within same day, didnâ€™t provide Chen with the facts he was hoping to use.That Apple Insider originally got Brian Chenâ€™s name wrong is an irony best left unmolested.Hayashiâ€™s own response was the best, laconic and effective, explaining why Japan seems to hate the iPhone and why, in fact, it likes it just fine.

Deutsche Telekom users just wanted to preorder a new iPhone 5. Instead they got phone sex. Nope, it’s not April Fools’ Day. It’s just a Friday. You can’t make this stuff up.Since Deutsch Telekom is Apple’s partner for Germany, the company was able to offer customers a voucher which would guarantee they could buy Cupertino’s latest and greatest. Germans with the carrier called the number provided to them via a text message. What they didn’t know was that Deutsche Telekom had royally screwed up, no pun intended. The number was one digit too long and thus resulted in connecting callers with an adult dating hotline advertised as “hot dating fun.”“We really regret what happened and have already apologised to our customers,” a Telekom spokesman said in a statement to Die Welt (via The Local). Once it realized its mistake, the German telecommunications company sent out a second text with an apology for the mistake and the correct preorder hotline number.Thankfully, this story has a happy ending. No, I’m not talking about that; get your head out of the gutter! Since a call to any 0800 number is free, the customers were not charged for Deutsche Telekom’s faux pas.If you’re lucky, preorders made today will ship on September 21, when the device will also go on sale in Apple Stores and other retail stores. Unfortunately, that date will likely be pushed back as Apple is having trouble dealing with demand. The craziness isn’t as high in Germany as it is in the US (where the iPhone 5 reportedly sold out in an hour), but Deutsche Telekom did say that customers had to call an average of three times just be connected with one of their employees.Read also: Apple’s iPhone 5 now available to preorder in select launch countries

Earlier this week, I noted a new suite of police-policing apps including OpenWatch and Cop Recorder, which turn your phone into a “reverse surveillance camera” for secretly recording run-ins with authority figures. Now it appears that police are well aware of those programs and others that complicate law enforcement, and at least some cops are none too happy about them.That’s one of the revelations of the latest operation by the hacker group LulzSec, which yesterday dumped a cache of files that it stole from the Arizona Police Department, calling Arizona a “racial profiling anti-immigrant police state.” A pair of documents among the hundreds leaked show concerns about how smartphones are being used for everything from recording interactions with police to evading speed traps.One document labelled “Law Enforcement Sensitive” lists the following apps, and warns officers to “take the time to look at an arrestee’s cell phone to see what applications they have.”Cop Recorder: Developed under the OpenWatch project, the app lets users stealthily record their interactions with police or other authority figures and upload them to OpenWatch’s server, where some of the videos are anonymized and posted online with legal analysis. The latest version of the app for Android, called OpenWatch rather than Cop Recorder, allows the secret capturing of video as well as audio.Trapster and Police Alert: Both apps aim to show users the location of speed traps. The free app Trapster crowdsources the problem, allowing users to add or confirm police locations, even tracking users’ reputations to improve the accuracy of their submissions. Police Alert, a $3.99 app for Android, seems to map out police locations without user interaction, but users warn in reviews that it rarely updates and is largely inaccurate.Caller ID Faker: Users can spoof a call’s source through the Web or using an app for Android or for jailbroken iPhones, entering whatever ID number they choose and even altering their voice. Presumably police fear that the app, which offers what its website calls “good laughs to make it through the crazy stress of each day,” has led to an increase in prank 911 calls.Another document from LulzSec’s hacked collection, provided to Arizona’s police from the Department of Justice’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property division, describes concerns over Apple’s “find my iPhone” feature, which allows users to remotely wipe their phone’s data. The Department warns that users may delete evidence from seized phones.Law enforcement’s solution? Keep seized phones in metal-plated Faraday bags or other radio-frequency-shielded container until their data can be copied.Here’s the full PDF of that “Find my iPhone” brief.Leaking its smartphone-related documents is the least of the Arizona police’s worries after the LulzSec hack. In a response to the breach, officials have warned that it could lead to retaliation against individual officers in the state. “Law enforcement officials go to many lengths to protect their identities,” Arizona Highway Patrol Association president Jimmy Chavez wrote in a statement Thursday.  “These individuals maliciously released confidential information knowing the safety of DPS employees, and their families, would be compromised.  A threat to release more DPS files demonstrates how heinous the hackers are willing to act. The AHPA would like to see the people brought to justice and prosecuted to the highest degree of the law.”

It is being viewed as a significant development as it is the first time that the smartphone industry’s high-stakes patents wars have affected iPhone users directly by restricting the capabilities of their handset.Push notifications for iCloud and MobileMe services were disabled last night, Apple told German users. To get their email, contacts and calendar updates, users will have to collect it manually or set their iPhone to make regular checks.It follows Motorola’s victory in a court case last month. At the time, Apple dismissed the relevant patent as an “old pager patent” and vowed to appeal the decision.“Apple believes this old pager patent is invalid and we’re appealing the court’s decision,” it said.Today it added: "This ruling only impacts customers in Germany who use a push setting to get their MobileMe and iCloud email. These customers will still receive email to their devices."Motorola is engaged in several legal battles with Apple, as part of the broader patent wars. Last week a court in Munich ordered it not to include a “slide to unlock” feature in its future smartphones, after Apple successfully claimed it infringed an iPhone patent.Google’s last year decided to spend $12.5bn to acquire Motorola because of its portfolio of thousands of smartphone patents. The search giant plans to use the armoury to defend the Android operating system from attacks by Apple, Microsoft and others.Apple this week complained to the European Commission that Motorola was failing to meet its so-called FRAND obligations, which require firms to licence standard technology to rivals on fair terms. Officials in Brussels are already investigating Samsung on similar allegations.But according to Florian Mueller, a German intellectual property expert who tracks the patent wars, Motorola’s “old pager patent” is unlikely to come under the scope of any European Commission investigation because it is not cover standard technology.“This is the first time that Apple's customers have started to see and feel the effects of the ongoing patent disputes in the smartphone and tablet computer industry in the form of a removal of certain functionality,” he said.“The patent that now affects Apple's push email service in Germany does not appear to be essential to any industry standard.”Germany, Europe’s largest smartphone market, has become the frontline in the patent wars because of its relatively speedy court process and because the winner in an intellectual property case is often granted a potentially disruptive injunction against the loser.

As much as I have enjoyed Gizmodo's scoops about new technology, I am afraid this is the last time I will be visiting the site. I was excited to read about Apple's new iPhone but horrified to see personal details of the engineer that lost it published on the site. I am sure he was horrified to have lost the phone but I cannot imagine what it must feel like to have his photo plastered all over stories about his legendary fuck up.Thank you for your feedback. Here's the reason why we decided to post the story.Powell is now under the public eye, which will protect him against Apple firing him (We believe he's still employed and Apple didn't fire him when they found out, a month ago. He's a valuable engineer). It's embarrassing, yes, but it's like insurance. If Apple fires him, they will get a huge PR backslash.But let's not forget: 1) He lost one of the most valuable gadgets in the world. And 2) the story—and his name—was going to be reported by other media. We had the facts before anyone else. It was our job to report on it.You should look at the bigger picture.. j.

The discovery that gripping the iPhone 4 in a way that bridges the left and bottom antennas can cause serious signal problems has resulted in—to say the least—a lot of controversy. However, most of the data that either "proves" or "refutes" that existence of said problem has been anecdotal at best. So AnandTech used a clever hack to get an iPhone 4 to report actual signal strength instead of "bars," giving some quantitative data about how bridging the antennas can negatively affect signal strength. The analysis explains why not all users are affected by the problem, and further investigation also shows that the antenna design does in fact improve reception as long as the left-bottom area isn't bridged when holding the device.Other mobile handsets definitely have antenna attenuation problems—when cupping an iPhone 3GS or Google Nexus One in the manner that causes problems with the iPhone 4, AnandTech measured 14dB and 18dB drops, respectively. However, the problem with the iPhone 4's external antenna is worse; bridging the antennas detunes 3G reception by a full 24dB.As long as you have a signal strong enough to show five bars on your iPhone 4—between ?51dBm and ?91dBm—a 24dB drop in signal strength shouldn't drop your call or data connection. However, Apple only uses a very small range of signal strength for showing four or less bars, from ?91dBm down to the usable signal cutoff of ?113dBm. If your iPhone displays four bars or less, a 24dB attenuation will cut the signal below the useable limit.That's definitely a significant problem—one that Apple has so far failed to address adequately, in our opinion—but there is good news in all of this. AnandTech also discovered that the iPhone 4 can actually use signal at the lower threshold far more reliably than any previous iPhone. "It's readily apparent that the new baseband hardware is much more sensitive compared to what was in the 3GS," according to Anand Shimpi. "The difference is that reception is massively better on the iPhone 4 in actual use."Rumors have suggested that Apple has an update to iOS 4 coming soon that may address the issue, and an e-mail from Steve Jobs to a frustrated customer seems to support that theory. A reader indicated to us via e-mail that Apple may be using digitally adjustable solid state capacitors to tune the iPhone 4's antennas, which if true would make a software fix possible.While Apple has yet to externally admit there is a problem, the company is definitely looking to beef up its on-staff expertise in antenna engineering—ironically posting job listings for mobile antenna engineers on the same day that the iPhone 4 problems were discovered. Until Apple does offer an official fix (assuming one can be made), using some type of case, or alternately covering the gap between antennas on the bottom left corner with some type of insulating material, is the only reliable solution if you're affected by this problem.

Steven Levy, a journalist from Newsweek magazine, holds the Apple iPhone outside the Apple store on New York's 5th Avenue June 29, 2007.Professor Jonathan Zittrain says the latest must-have devices are sealed, "sterile" boxes that stifle creativity and turn consumers into passive users of technology.Unlike home computers, new Internet-enabled gadgets don't lend themselves to the sort of tinkering and collaboration that leads to technological advances, he says.The mix of gadgets, over-regulation and Internet security fears could destroy the old system where mainstream technology could be "influenced, even revolutionized, out of left field"."I don't want to see a two-tier world where only the experts can survive ... and the non-experts are stuck between something they don't understand and something that limits them," Zittrain told Reuters in an interview.Zittrain, professor of Internet governance and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford University, says the Internet's simple, open architecture is key to its enormous success and also its flaws.Amateur enthusiasts have come up with scores of new ideas by tinkering with the Internet on home computers. However, hackers have caused huge disruption by exploiting its loose structure.Zittrain contrasts one of the first mass-produced home computers, the Apple II from the 1970s, with Apple's latest gadget, the iPhone. He says the iPhone is typical of what he calls "tethered appliances"."They are appliances in that they are easy to use, while not easy to tinker with," he writes. "They are tethered because it is easy to for their vendors to change them from afar, long after the devices have left warehouses and showrooms."They are a world away from the "generative Internet", a term Zittrain uses to describe the open, creative, innovative approach that helped build the Internet.The rise of viruses and fraud has also led to tighter controls on PCs, particularly those in schools, universities, offices and public places, Zittrain says.People are often blocked from experimenting with shared computers and their input is severely limited.There is still time to save the Internet, he believes, although the answer lies in social rather than technological changes.Society should resist more regulation and place its trust in the Internet's users. The success of Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia written and edited by its readers, shows how self-governance can work.Internet users should see themselves as "netizens", active participants in the online world rather than passive consumers."The community itself exercises a form of self-restraint and policing," he said. "You see it in Britain when you try to jump a queue, you see it on Wikipedia when a page is vandalised."The challenge to the technologists is to build technologies to let people of good faith help without having to devote their lives to it."* The Future of the Internet and How To Stop It, futureoftheinternet.org , is published by Penguin.

Skype has launched its video-calling service for the Apple iPhone, a week earlier than many expected – with more announcements from the VoIP specialist due at CES 2011 in Las Vegas early next month.So if you have an iPhone 4 and want to make Skype-to-Skype video calls with others (either on their iPhones or PCs/Macs) then you can grab the latest version of Skype's iOS app from iTunes today.The video calling app will work over Wi-Fi or 3G, although initial tests show that the video quality and stuttering on 3G video calls are somewhat compromised when compared with the smooth flowing moving images on Wi-Fi."Video calling significantly enhances the user experience of Skype for iPhone, which is one of the top five free iPhone apps in 2010 according to Apple," said the company."Now, users can make and receive free Skype-to-Skype calls, call mobiles and landlines around the world at very low rates, and now share more moments together with video on Skype for iPhone,"The new Skype for iPhone app will also work with the with the iPhone 3GS, and iPod touch 4th generation with iOS 4.0 or above – although obviously only allowing the caller to send video from the single camera on the back of the phone or iPod in those cases.iPod touch 3rd generation and iPad will both be able to receive video calls, but not send them, due to the lack of video-shooting capabilities on those devices.Most excitingly, for many Skype users, video calls can now be made between your PC or Mac laptop or desktop and your iOS device.Your desktop client will need to be Skype for Windows 4.2 or above (or Skype for Mac 2.8 and above) – plus the app will also work with other desktop clients and devices such as Skype for Linux and the Asus-manufactured standalone Skype Videophone.The Skype for iPhone application is freely available to download from the Apple App Store – for more head to www.skype.com/go/iphone

Chinese workers injured while making touchscreens for mobile devices, including iPhones, have written to Apple asking it to do more to help them.Some 137 workers suffered adverse health effects following exposure to a chemical, known as n-hexane.They claim that the Taiwanese factory owner has not given them enough compensation.Apple did not offer comment on the letter.Five workers, including 27-year-old Jia Jingchuan, have signed a letter to chief executive officer Steve Jobs, asking Apple to offer more help over the incidents.They say that the factory owner has not given enough compensation, has pressured those who took compensation to give up their jobs and failed to offer assurance that workers who may suffer fresh illnesses will have medical bills taken care of.Wintek, the Taiwanese company that owns the factory, said that it used the chemical in place of alcohol because it evaporated more quickly and speeded up production of touchscreens.It has now reverted to using alcohol to clean screens.Workers exposed to n-hexane experienced faintness and tiredness, sweaty hands and feet, numbness in hands and swelling and pain in feet. Some claim they are still suffering ill-effects.Experts say that daily exposure to n-hexane can cause long-term damage.In its annual report, published last week, Apple acknowledged the incident."In 2010 we learned that 137 workers at the Suzhou facility of Wintek, one of Apple's suppliers, had suffered adverse health effects following exposure to n-hexane, a chemical in cleaning agents used in some manufacturing processes," the report read."We required Wintek to stop using n-hexane and to provide evidence that they had removed the chemical from their production lines," it said.Apple said it also asked the firm to provide adequate ventilation in the factory. It will monitor the plant and will reaudit the facility later this year.Wintek also supplies components to a number of other companies, including Nokia and HTC.This is not the first problem Apple has experienced with its Chinese factories.Its annual report also references an incident at its main China supplier Foxconn's factory, where over a dozen workers committed suicide."We were disturbed and deeply saddened to learn that factory workers were taking their own lives," the report read.It said "suicide prevention specialists" were working with Foxconn to improve conditions.

A lot has changed in Apple’s new iPhone. But with the Verizon Wireless and Sprint versions of the iPhone 5, there’s something that will remain the same from the old model: The phone still won’t be able to place a call and handle data activity over the cellular network at the same time.Older Verizon and Sprint smartphones on 3G networks were not able to handle simultaneous calls and data because of a limitation in CDMA, the 3G technology that those networks use. But now some Verizon 4G LTE smartphones will let you stay on a phone call while looking up something in an app or checking e-mail. So why not the iPhone 5?Brenda Raney, a Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, said it was Apple’s decision to design the iPhone 5 so that customers could make voice calls and do Internet activity simultaneously only over Wi-Fi, not over Verizon’s cell network. “The iPhone 5 is designed to allow customers to make voice calls on the Verizon Wireless network and surf the Web on Wi-Fi,” she said in an e-mail. “It was an Apple decision.”The explanation for this, it turns out, is complicated. The technology in 4G LTE networks does not currently handle voice transmissions; it only does data. So when you place a phone call on a 4G LTE smartphone, it’s actually rolling back to the carrier’s older second- or third-generation network, according to AnandTech, a Web publication that does deep analysis on hardware.That means when AT&T customers place a phone call and use data on the iPhone 5, both functions will roll back to AT&T’s older network, which can handle them simultaneously. When you place a phone call while using data in an app with a Verizon or Sprint iPhone 5, it will roll back to their older CDMA networks, which are not capable of simultaneously doing calls and data. And that’s why the iPhone 5 on Verizon and Sprint, despite being a 4G LTE device, will still not do both at the same time.An Apple spokeswoman, Natalie Kerris, put it this way: “iPhone 5 supports simultaneous voice and data on GSM-based 3G and LTE networks. It is not yet possible to do simultaneous voice and data on networks that use CDMA for voice and LTE for data in a single radio design.”So why does Verizon’s Samsung Galaxy S III, a 4G LTE phone, juggle calls and data? Samsung added an extra antenna so that it pulls data from the 4G LTE network at the same time that it’s using another antenna to do voice, said Anand Shimpi, editor in chief of AnandTech.Then why didn’t Apple add another antenna? Its phone already has two antennas in an effort to improve reception, and it would have had to add a third antenna just for Verizon and Sprint phones to give them simultaneous data and calls, Mr. Shimpi explained. Leaving that third antenna out allows Apple to simplify the process of manufacturing the iPhone for multiple carriers. Plus, in the next two years, 4G LTE technology is supposed to evolve to support voice calls, which would render another antenna unnecessary.Whew! Despite that explanation, the ability to do calls and data at the same time was one of the major things that AT&T’s iPhone customers had that Verizon’s and Sprint’s didn’t. And for now, that story remains the same with the iPhone 5 — which may be a consideration for customers considering a new phone on those networks.

Surveillance companies can use your iPhone to take photos of you and your surroundings without your knowledge, said a representative from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism at a panel chaired by Julian Assange™ today.Companies also sell products that will let them change the messages you write, track your location and nick your email contacts, claimed speakers on the panel that included representatives from Privacy International and the aforementioned bureau."Who here has an iPhone, who has a BlackBerry, who uses Gmail?" Assange asked. "Well you're all screwed," he continued, "the reality is that intelligence operations are selling right now mass surveillance systems for all those products".Speaking on the panel, Pratap Chatterjee of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (which works out of City University, but is an independent organisation) said that your phone could be used to record and send information about you even when it is in stand-by mode. That data included location, recordings of your conversations and even photographs. This spy software could run on iPhone, BlackBerry and Windows mobile kit.Stefania Maurizi, a journalist from Italy's weekly news magazine L'Espresso, showed documents that suggested that software products could not only read emails and text messages sent from spied-on phones, but could actually fake new ones or alter the text of messages sent.As The Reg has already discussed, all these software products are commercially available, and sold seemingly without any regulation.Maurizi and N Ram, editor-in-chief of India's The Hindu newspaper (speaking over a Skype connection) said that they were particularly worried by the lack of a legal framework and the absence of checks and balances in the surveillance system.Steven Murdoch of Cambridge Security group said such software was being made by British companies including ones based in Surrey and Oxford.He added that even lawful interception was no longer targeted and backed up by suspicions. "We're seeing increasingly wholesale monitoring of entire populations with no suspicion of wrongdoing – the data is being monitored and stored in the hope that it might one day be useful.""Without controls on this industry, the threat that surveillance poses to freedom on expression and human rights in general is only going to increase." ®

From a user’s perspective there is not much difference between a smartphone and a tablet. Both devices are portable touch-screen computers, and while the a smartphone might have a dedicated dialing application by default, the ability to make voice calls or connect to a cellular network is not an exclusive feature. However, thanks to U.S. Copyright law the difference between an iPhone and an iPad is not just the screen size, it is the freedom to install software without a gatekeeper.The Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), passed in 1998, banned the circumvention of technology tailored to protect copyright. Due the the potential for these digital locks to prevent otherwise legal practices, such as transferring the music from  CD to your computer, the DMCA instructed the U.S. Copyright office to consider exemptions to the law every three years.In 2010, the last year that exemptions were published, the U.S. Copyright Office ruled (PDF) that installing the software of your choice in your mobile device would be exempt from the DMCA. Jailbreaking and rooting, modifying the software of iOS and Android devices, respectively, to modify the operating system, delete unnecessary applications, or simply install applications that might not be available in the designated application stores, became officially legal.This past October the U.S. Copyright Office issued the latest decision (PDF) in this triennial rulemaking, extending the exemption for jailbreaking and rooting for smartphones but not expanding the same freedom to tablet users. As a result two very similar devices with the same processor, operating system, and dedicated application store offer very different degrees of freedom.The ruling also rolled back the freedom to circumvent digital locks in order to unlock a handset. In the United States wireless carriers often sell mobile devices that are restricted to operate on a limited number of wireless networks. This prevents users from taking their phone with them to another carrier or even using a different SIM card when traveling abroad. In 2006 the Copyright Office granted an exemption allowing users to unlock their own device, an exemption that was extended in 2010. The most recent rule-making eliminated this exemption and starting in January 2013 users will technically violate copyright if they unlock their smartphone without their carriers’ permission.Although the recent DCMA rulemaking primarily impacts U.S. users, the U.S. has actively pushed other countries to adopt restrictions against circumventing copyright protections including through trade agreements such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which was rejected by the European Parliament but recently passed in Japan. Similar language has also been included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (PDF).Combined, these efforts are a stark reminder on how copyright protections can extend beyond media and capture the basic freedoms of control over the devices we purchase and use.

Intel outlined its plan to catch up in the smartphone processor business at its annual investor day in Santa Clara, California, Thursday: crush competitors with the weight of its multi-billion-dollar fabs and the thousands of developers it can throw at the problem of tuning mobile software to run on its processors.The goal: keep the attention of key customers such as Apple as smartphones, tablets, and personal computing devices converge. Apple relies on Intel processors for its notebook and desktop computers, and ARM-based designs for its booming smartphone and tablet products — leading some to fret that Apple could one day switch to ARM-based chips for the Mac.“Our job is to ensure our silicon is so compelling, in terms off running the Mac better or being a better iPad device, that as they make those decisions they can’t ignore us,” Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said.Earlier this year Motorola Mobility and Lenovo — among others — announced plans to build phones using Intel’s mobile processors. More are coming, Otellini promised. “A year ago there was no one who was not an Intel employee who thought Intel stood a chance in this business,” Otellini said. “And now you’re asking what our market share goals are.”While Intel may be an underdog in smartphone processors, Herman Eul, who co-managers Intel’s mobile and communications group with Mike Bell, argued that Intel is already an “incumbent” in the broader wireless semiconductor business, particularly in radio-frequency chips. Since Intel closed its acquisition of German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon’s wireless assets, Intel has shipped 500 million wireless chipsets.Intel’s formula for addressing its challenge in the smartphone processor business is the same one the Santa Clara, Calif.-based processor manufacturer has used to dominate everything from server rooms to personal computers: use its size to support manufacturing capabilities its rivals can’t match.Intel is racing to pair its smartphone processor designs — which are based on the same x86 processor architecture that now dominates the notebook business — with its latest manufacturing processes. “What the process technology does is gives us better performance, at better power at better size,” Intel’s Bell said. “We think this is a fundamental advantage that we have.”While rivals are struggling to crank enough processors with features 28 nanometers wide to meet demand this year, Bell said Intel plans to leapfrog them with an upcoming part, the Intel XMM 7260, with features just 22 nanometers wide next year. Intel will follow up with processors built using Intel’s 14 nanometer manufacturing process in 2014.Rivals, meanwhile, are counting on cheap chips built by contract manufacturers to knock Intel off its game. “You don’t want to be dragging around an asset base based on a model that might be changing,” AMD Chief Executive Rory Read told Forbes in February. Nvidia CEO Jen Hsun-Huang has even cheekily suggested that Intel build Nvidia’s chips in its factories.Intel’s secret weapon: a massive corps of software engineers. Intel is the second largest contributor to the open-source Linux operating system. It’s using that expertise to help tune mobile software for its chips: it has 1200 engineers helping Google with its Android mobile operating system. It also helped Apple manage its shift from PowerPC processors to Intel’s processors for the Mac. There can be doubt Intel would be happy to help Apple make a similar shift in its smartphone and tablet businesses.

In Apple's mind, here's how it was all supposed to play out: Samsung loses in court, and customers see a bad-nasty-bad company that steals ideas. Who wants a cheap knock-off, anyway?Funny thing is, it seems that the Apple v. Samsung trial actually had a very favorable effect on Samsung, because it has been selling GSIII's like hotcakes ever since. In fact, according to a new study by Localytics, sales of the device grew by 16% during the week of the Apple verdict. Ha!Instead of seeing Samsung as an inferior knock-off company, consumers actually took notice. If Apple thought Samsung's products were good enough to take them to court over, then they mustbe a viable option, right? Customers have clearly spoken.To add insult to injury, Samsung saw its next spike in GSIII sales - up by 15% - during the week of Apple's iPhone 5 announcement. Unhappy iPhone owners? People unimpressed with the 5? Or perhaps it's just because that's around the time when Samsung really kicked its new advertising campaign into high gear.It's hard to say what the realreason is. Either way, though, this is probably not the sort of result Apple was expecting.

As big phone rivals AT&T and Verizon (VZ_) square off this week on first-quarter earnings, Wall Street awaits the numbers from Ma Bell's wireless unit now that the iPhone sells at Verizon.Analysts expect that the loss of Apple iPhone exclusivity took the steam out of AT&T's wireless growth. The number of new so-called post-paid contract customers AT&T added in the first quarter fell uncomfortably close to zero, according to at least one analyst.How close? UBS analyst John Hodulik had been calling for a net loss of 100,000 customers until he recently boosted his post-paid net add number for AT&T to 50,000. Most of the impact came as sales were siphoned off to the Verizon iPhone.But what AT&T lost in new iPhones, it partially made up for in old iPhones. Thanks to the recent heavy promotion of the $49 iPhone 3GS, AT&T avoided an alarming net loss of customers, said Hodulik.If Hodulik's 50,000 target is accurate, it would be 90% below the normal quarterly net add number of 538,250 post-paid customers that AT&T averaged last year.Meanwhile, over at Verizon, analysts are expecting strong subscriber gains, not just from the iPhone but also from the popularity of the Google (GOOG_) Android-powered HTC Thunderbolt.The street consensus calls for Verizon to have added 900,000 post-paid customers, fueled by an estimated 2.9 million iPhone sales, according to a preview report by Morgan Stanley's Simon Flannery Monday.But the loss of iPhone exclusivity doesn't fully explain the slowdown at AT&T.While record numbers of U.S. customers are drawn to pricey smartphones, there's also been a strong shift to lower-cost prepaid services.Hodulik points to the rising popularity of prepaid service and its corrosive effect on the post-paid market. Cheap phones and even cheaper month-to-month service plans have been catching on as people seek alternatives to hefty two-year service contracts.Hodulik predicts that, industry wide, prepaid will be 65% of the total net new customers in the first quarter, up from 51% in the fourth quarter.

While China sees nothing near the frenzy of the first U.S. iPhone launch day, crowds there do honor the tradition of lining up for the phone hours in advance. But price--and a lack of Wi-Fi--could prove a deterrent.It could be the Year of the iPhone in China, as Apple officially started selling its iconic smartphone in the world's largest mobile market Friday night.While China saw nothing near the frenzy of the first iPhone launch day here in the U.S., crowds there did honor the tradition of lining up for the phone many hours in advance at several locations. A few hundred people queued up in the rain and cold outside The Place shopping center in Beijing, for example. There, Zhi Xianzhong became the first person to get the iPhone from Apple partner China Unicom after waiting 7 hours and 40 minutes, according to China Daily.As expected, China Unicom, the country's second largest telecom operator after China Mobile, is selling two versions of the iPhone in China under a three-year deal with Apple. But cost could prove to be a deterrent. Prices range from 4,999 yuan (about $732) for the 8GB 3G model to 6,999 yuan (about $1,025) for the 32GB 3GS phone (sans contract).Consumers can get cheaper, cracked, gray-market iPhone models at local electronics stores or bring them in from other markets. But price isn't the only potential obstacle here. In accordance with Chinese government regulations, the handsets also lack a key feature--Wi-Fi capability, though reports say China Unicom hopes to offer Wi-Fi-enabled iPhones within a few months.China Unicom is starting off by selling the iPhone in 285 cities. The carrier hopes to sell 5 million devices in three years, according to Chinese news reports, but the company wouldn't confirm that figure.

Now we know why Google Voice apps were only released for BlackBerry and Android. Apple rejected Google's official Google Voice app when it was submitted for approval six weeks ago. What. The. Shit.Here's the quote from the Google spokesperson to TechCrunch:"We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, including the iPhone. Apple did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store. We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users - for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers."This news comes on the heels of Sean Kovacs' GV Mobile Google Voice app being pulled from the store for "duplicating features." Even though, TechCrunch relates, Phil Schiller himself personally approved GV Mobile and called Kovacs to apologize when its initial approval was delayed months ago.TechCrunch suspects, probably correctly, that apps for Google Voice are being rejected at least in part through AT&T's influence, since Google Voice lets you send free text messages and delivers cut-rate international callsâ€”on top of making phone numbers even more meaninglessâ€”making it scary to AT&T in way like Skype VoIP over 3G. Either way, it seems obvious the Google Voice service is being targeted for extinction, at least as a native app on the iPhone.Google plans to take the same route it was forced to take with Latitude on the iPhoneâ€”web app land. It's an interesting switch for Google and Apple on the app front, actually. Google was noted for getting away with using private APIs in its Google Mobile app to make the voice search command work. Now Apple's rejected two of its major apps in a row, in a way validating Google's belief that web apps are the future anyway.It seems somewhat silly, and a bit of a reach, to insinuate the rejections are signs of brewing hostilities between Apple and Google, but you have to figure if there weren't any behind the rejections, they've at least got to be causing some anxiety by now.Whatever the reasons, it sucks, and as Jason Kincaid says, what's really troubling about this rejection is that it appears that "Apple is now actively stifling innovation." And the whole black box app approval process doesn't exactly alleviate that sinking feeling either. After all, if Google doesn't stand a chance, how does anybody else?

Deep within the bowels of the iPhone OS are some property list files that describe the capabilities of the various iPhone and iPod touch models. According to a reader with access to the latest iPhone OS 3.0 developer beta, there is a plist file for a new, unknown device.Our source believes that the new device, referred to as N18AP, may represent updated iPod touch hardware. The plist for the second-generation iPhone (N82AP), for instance, simply includes the plist for the original and lists the updated features—like GPS and 3G capabilities. Likewise, the plist for the second-generation iPod touch (N72AP) includes the plist for the original and lists only the updated features.That leads us to the new discovery. The plist file for N18AP apparently includes the plist for N72AP, the second-gen iPod touch, leading to the speculation that the device is an updated iPod touch model. The only new capability listed, however, is "encode-aac."How this capability might relate to new features is not known. It's easy to speculate that it could include a recording feature, but the current iPod touch can already do that. All we can say for certain from this information is that Apple has some device similar to an iPod touch that can encode AAC format audio and is expected to run iPhone OS 3.0. If or when it will appear as a new product, however, is known only to Apple.

A group of thieves in Japan got a jump start on nabbing Apple Inc .’s iPhone 5 before anyone else in the world Friday morning.At a time when thousands of eager Apple fans were already lined up outside outlets around the world, Osaka police said 191 of Apple’s latest must-have smartphone were stolen in the wee hours leading up to the official launch. As of Friday at noon, three stores were hit across Japan’s western metropolis in an unusual string of robberies targeting the hottest tech toy this fall.Authorities said they discovered 33 iPhone 5’s were missing from one of KDDI Corp .’s au-brand shops in Ibaraki city, a suburban nook in Osaka prefecture. The iPhone is available on KDDI’s au network, one of the two Japanese carriers that provides services to the U.S. giant’s sleek gadgets. The police went to check out the outlet after some nearby residents called a little before 3 a.m. saying they saw three men snooping around the store. The men and the phones remain at large. A police spokesman said there was no one lined up outside the store at the time of the robbery.About two hours later, a Softbank Corp store in the western district of Osaka city was wiped clean of its iPhone 5 stock. All 116 devices were stolen, including one store display. The police said they were taken from the locked backroom within a four minute span from 4:24 a.m. as shown on security camera footage. The video recording also showed there were three culprits, all likely to be male. The police said it is uncertain whether the robbery is related to the incident in Ibaraki, located about 20 minutes away by car. The store manager called the police at around 7:45 a.m. when he arrived at the store and discovered the lock to the store pried open. The police valued the stolen goods at ¥7.45 million. The store didn’t open on Friday.A nearby au store was broken into at 2:30 a.m. where 42 iPhone 5’s were taken. Only two, which were packed elsewhere in the store, were left behind. The police said it is unclear whether any of the people behind the other two robberies were involved in this one. The authorities have yet to see the security footage so do not have an idea of who or how many suspects there may be.The thefts are an unfamiliar sidebar accompanying the frenzied first hours when Apple’s latest product hit store shelves, which have previously run into technical glitches. But it’ll likely add to the supply stress. Apple said initial sales of the iPhone 5 set a new company record. Pre-orders on the first day topped 2 million units. Since then, Apple has said pre-order customers would have to wait up to one month for a new iPhone to ship.Like Japan Real Time on Facebook for the latest updates.

Google Android has one of the best features designed for Google maps. Makes sense, doesn’t it? But while the newly released Android is getting all the hype in the news as of late, it seems Apple isn’t going to let Google get away with that title just yet. With the software 2.2 update, the iPhone will now support Google Street View as well as mass transit directions. With this feature, people will be able to view their actual surroundings so they can get a better sense of where they need to go. The mass transit feature is especially helpful for those who commute on a daily basis and need to catch those buses on time.It wasn’t too long ago that a map was the confused traveler’s staple — you’d stare at it for what seemed like hours, dimly aware of your orientation or distances, unable to fold it back into it’s designed shape.With all the advances in technology over the last few years, we’ve gotten to the point where the map has become cumbersome, replaced by slick-thin devices which not only give you an idea of your surroundings, but also the local fare.With Google Maps applications such as Street View and mass transit directions, it my be only a matter of time before the standard changes once again. Just think, we won’t have to pull out our phones anymore to look up the stop we missed. There could even be interactive touch screen maps on the bus itself. Although the software update is another step towards a future of incredible ease, it will be interesting to see what will come out in the next five years that could make this obsolete.

[From Christoph J. Landers] Hi Sammy, People on the internet are talking a lot about the Palm-Apple-Patent-showdown, and I just wanted to share my opinion on the matter with fellow Palm-users. I love PalmAddict, and read it quite a lot (it's one of the few blogs on the internet that I actually read at least once a day). Good Job.It's fun to read the comments iPhone-users made about the Palm Pre. Particularly how it's just a cheap imitation that rips-off their beloved device. More importantly, that the Pre Palm blatantly steals from Apple, and Palm should be sued. The question - of course - these iPhone-people should ask themselves is this: how stupid do you think Palm is? - Sure one of the goals of Palm is to find the holes in Apple's newly granted patents...but that's the way the game is played: if you are able to pass through a hole in someone's description of their IP than that is your right. You may even patent that hole yourself. To give an example...In Apple's patent it is stated that: "In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, the device 100 may include a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from the touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen." [Read more]AppleInsider pointed out that "Interestingly, this is a feature Palm is already touting about its upcoming Pre handset. According to Palm's press release: "[The Pre has a] gesture area, which enables simple, intuitive gestures for navigation." The gesture area is separate from the touch screen." [Read more]iPhone-users are eager to point out that Palm is in violation of the Apple patent. But they are wrong. They are wrong simply because Apple presented a hole, and Palm decided to use that: the patent clearly states that the touchpad 'does not display visual output'. So what did Palm do? - They created a gesture area that DOES display a visual output: if you touch it, it lights up (this was clearly said by Palm during their introduction of the Pre, and you can see it on some of the demos on YouTube). Light is visual, and it is an output. So when we compare it to Apple's patent the question rises: "is this a touch-sensitive area that is separate from the touch screen and does not display a visual output?" - for if it is, then Palm's gesture area is illegal. The answer is simple: no. Yes it's touch-sensitive, and yes it's separate from the touch screen, but no, it is not NOT display visual output. And that means that Apple's lawyers will have a hard time proving that this is still part of Apple's IP.My guess is, that Palm has spend a lot of time on finding the holes in Apple's patent (proposal) and has spend even more time on playing with the holes in it. And from the looks of it, Palm did a great job...and these iPhone-people know it, and that's what they are most afraid of.

Apple has applied for a patent covering various methods for identifying and disabling unauthorized use â€” including jailbreaking and other hacks â€” of electronic devices, such as its popular iPhone and iPad products.Although the U.S. government has legally authorized the jailbreaking (i.e. running code that gives users access to extensions and themes that Apple has not approved, as well as use carriers that are not supported by Apple) of iPhones and other electronic devices for â€œeducational purposes,â€? it seems that Apple is determined to gain further control over said devices.Currently, the Cupertino, California-based tech company automatically revokes its warranty on all iPhones that have been subject to jailbreaking and other hacks.The patent, which was filed in February and published on Thursday, primarily focuses on measures for identifying stolen devices and protecting the kinds of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and passwords, stored on those devices. Upon learning that a customerâ€™s iPhone has been stolen, for instance, sensitive data stored on that customerâ€™s device could be sent to one of Appleâ€™s remote storage servers and then erased entirely from the phone.However, the patent also covers methods for identifying devices that have been hacked, jailbroken, unlocked or had their SIM cards removed, such as monitoring sudden increases in memory usage that could â€œindicate that a hacking program is being run and that an unauthorized user may be using the electronic device.â€? Theoretically, Apple could then wipe personal data from these devices and then alert AT&T to â€œshutdown any telephone service to the electronic device, shutdown the electronic device itself, or otherwise suitably extract the functions of the electronic device.â€?In other words, the system described in the patent allow Apple to effectively kill jailbroken devices under the guise of protecting customers from theft, since it may not be able to determine whether a device has been stolen or if it is being willingly jailbroken by users.

A security flaw in Apple Inc.'s iPhone allows unauthorized users to gain easy access to private contacts and e-mails even when the device is locked, but the company said a fix is on the way.Popular technology blog Gizmodo and an online forum run by the Mac Rumors site showed that it took only three taps to gain access to locked iPhones, which run the latest 2.02 iPhone software.A spokeswoman said in an e-mail that Apple was aware of the problem and was readying a software update to fix it. In the meantime, she recommended users set the iPhone's "Home" button to open up the phone's iPod music collection rather than the phone's "Favorites" menu.The flaw could be seen as a momentary setback in Apple's ambitious plans to compete against Research In Motion, whose BlackBerry smart phone has become a standard issue device in corporate businesses around the globe.Earlier in August, technology research firm Gartner issued a report that said iPhone's software had met Gartner's minimum requirements for business support, although some issues persisted. The author of the report, Ken Dulaney, was not immediately reachable.Last week, Apple released a software update for the iPhone that reportedly helped fix problems connecting to faster third-generation (3G) wireless networks, after receiving a flurry of online complaints from customers around the world.

I know it's not a mind blowing concept, and frankly it's the way I see the cellular industry proceeding, or would expect to proceed, within the next, maybe, five years or so. I'm just curious if anyone in the know - whether it be someone that works on the communication hardware, or works for any of the major telecom companies, or is an engineer on any of the communication infrastructure, etc. - could tell me what's holding things up.I have the impression, with the advent of smart phones like the iPhone and various Android handsets, that the cellular industry will be shifting to a service whereby all information to and from a user's phone will simply be data - very similar to a computer and an internet connection, frankly. As phones become more PC/Mac-esque, it simply seems like an inevitability. You have a portable device, and information is accessed through a telecom's cellular network.So what's preventing this sort of shift? I'm aware that the telecoms are able to set different pricing depending on the type of usage in a manner that doesn't accurately reflect the strain on their infrastructure - particularly for text messages, if I understand things correctly. So is it purely about money? Or, is there actually something technically different between a smartphone making a call, sending a text, or receiving data that does genuinely affect the manner in which these different forms of communication are handled on the network's side of things?It just blows my mind how different the cellular phone industry is from other seemingly similar services, such as internet, television, and home phone. I don't understand how or why customers continue to put up with extensive two or three year contracts for a service that should, I would think, be a simple month to month access to data. Effectively, very similar to cellular/satellite access to the internet though your phone, and no more.(I'd also like to see a shift away from subsidized phone prices, much like Apple is trying to do. Buy an unlocked phone every few years as necessary, and find a provider that can hook you up month to month. But that's an entirely different topic all together.)

Despite its new CEO promising a renewed focus on marketing, Research In Motion hasn’t been known for effective campaigns of late. The company launched a sizable advertising blitz earlier this year that focused on its new BlackBerry Bold smartphones, but the commercials had no apparent impact on smartphone sales in key markets including the United States. Late last month, RIM and its Australian marketing agency Tongue began a campaign that takes a different approach to raising brand awareness, though it’s one we have seen numerous times in the past: bash Apple and its customers.Samsung and Apple are tangled in a number of legal battles around the world, and Samsung carried the companies’ squabbles over to a recent advertising campaign that built up to the launch of its supersized smartphone, the Galaxy Note. As such, many thought Samsung was behind a recent guerrilla marketing stunt that saw a bus-load of men and women stage a protest outside an Apple Store in Australia.After Samsung denied being involved with the stunt amid media backlash, RIM stayed quiet on the matter until a bit of digging revealed that it was indeed responsible for the mock protest.RIM’s “Wake Up” stunt has now culminated in the launch of a website that continues to target Apple, the iPhone and iPhone owners. The wake up, be bold site states that BlackBerry owners are the type of people who “take action and make things happen.” Taking a shot at Apple’s well-known slogan, RIM goes on to note that BlackBerry users don’t just “think different,” they “do different.”“It’s a simple choice,” the website continues. “You’re either here to leave your mark and eat opportunity for breakfast or you’re satisfied to just float through life like a cork in the stream.”RIM gave the world its first glimpse at the next-generation BlackBerry 10 operating system last week during the BlackBerry World conference, though the first smartphone powered by the new platform is not expected to launch until October. In the meantime, the company will continue to push its BlackBerry 7 smartphones.

If you feel like going through the process of typing in your PIN every time you unlock your iPhone is worth it thanks to the unconquerable security it implies, you might want to read this report from Bernd Marienfeldt about the chosen one's security model. Yes, a PIN will keep casual users from picking up your phone and making a call with it, or firing off an e-mail to your co-workers saying that you're quitting and becoming an exotic dancer, but it won't keep someone from accessing all your data. Bernd and fellow security guru Jim Herbeck have discovered that plugging even a fully up-to-date, non-jailbroken iPhone 3GS into a computer running Ubuntu Lucid Lynx allows nearly full read access to the phone's storage -- even when it's locked. The belief is that they're just a buffer overflow away from full write access as well, which would surely open the door to making calls. Bernd believes the iPhone's lack of data encryption for content is a real problem, and also cites the inability to digitally sign e-mails as reasons why the iPhone is still not ready for prime time in the enterprise.

Among the world's leading productivity tools is an advanced technology known as paper. Many of the world's top corporations and most active internet users have adopted paper as a method of organizing their daily lives. When they think of something they need to do, they write it down on a piece of paper and keep that piece of paper with them.Though some advances have been made in paper's effectiveness -- such as the addition of a sticky section that allows you to attach a piece of paper to your monitor, your desktop, or even another piece of paper -- it turns out that paper is pretty hard to improve on, and reigns as a leading task management technology.When we set out to build Tasks (now in Gmail Labs), one of our goals was to improve upon paper. With the version of Tasks in Gmail, we focused on making editing very fast and simple -- as close to paper as we could. But despite dual-core CPUs, 30" monitors, and high speed internet connections, many Googlers still found themselves using paper to track their tasks.We did some competitive analysis and here is what we found.Paper has a number of popular features:Easy editing. Cross out with pen and write something new.Works offline. You can read paper even when your PC is not connected to the internet.Mobile. Fold paper and stick in pocket.Instant boot up. Just pull paper out of pocket -- don't have to wait for it to load.However, paper does have some limitations:Limited availability. You don't always have a pad of paper with you to write new things.Not ubiquitous. If you leave a piece of paper in one pair of jeans, you can't access it from the other jeans you're currently wearing.Difficult to organize. Eventually turns into a giant mess on your desk.We set out to fix this by making Tasks available from your phone with a version optimized for the small screen. And starting today, you can manage your task list from your iPhone or Android device, and access it from any xhtml enabled phone. (Mine's always with me, in whichever jeans I'm wearing.) Just go to gmail.com/tasks from your phone's browser and log in. If you already use the version of Tasks in Gmail Labs, you'll see the same task list that's always in sync. We focused on making it super easy and fast to update your Gmail task list -- you can add new tasks and check off completed ones, no matter where you are (like in a meeting or at the grocery store) even when you're in the bathroom.A number of Googlers have told us that with this new mobile UI they've finally scrapped the paper task management that they never really liked but couldn't ever beat. We're interested to hear what you think, and how this compares to paper, so try it out and let us know.P.S. There's a new gadget version of Tasks too -- so if you want to add your same task list to iGoogle, now you can.

Spyware developed by a U.K. group can take control of a number of mobile devices, including iPhones and BlackBerrys, turning on microphones and cameras, tracking locations and monitoring emails, text messages and voice calls.Gamma International specializes in “governmental IT intrusion and remote monitoring solutions,” as its website says. The company’s FinFisher software can infect personal computers as well, intercepting Skype calls and recording keystrokes, and was recently used to suppress dissent in Bahrain. The company says it did not sell the product to Bahrain’s government.“People are walking around with tools for surveillance in their pockets,” said John Scott-Railton, a doctoral student at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs who researched the software. “These are the tools that can be used to turn on your microphone and turn your phone into a tracking device.”The findings—which are consistent with Gamma’s own promotional materials for a FinFisher product called FinSpy Mobile—illustrate how the largely unregulated trade in offensive hacking tools is transforming surveillance, making it more intrusive as it reaches across borders and peers into peoples’ digital devices. FinFisher products can secretly monitor computers, intercepting Skype calls, turning on Web cameras and recording keystrokes. They are marketed by Gamma for law enforcement and government use. “I can confirm that Gamma supplies a piece of mobile intrusion software—FinSpy Mobile,” Gamma International GmbH Managing Director Martin J. Muench said in an Aug. 28 e-mail. “I certainly don’t intend to discuss how or on what platforms it works. I do not wish to inform criminals of how any of our detection systems are used against them.”More Below the AdIf you have trouble leaving a comment, review this help page. Still having problems?

Jailbreaking an iPhone constitutes copyright infringement and a DMCA violation, says Apple in comments filed with the Copyright Office as part of the 2009 DMCA triennial rulemaking. This marks the first formal public statement by Apple about its legal stance on iPhone jailbreaking.Apple's iPhone, now the best-selling cellular phone in the U.S., has been designed with restrictions that prevent owners from running applications obtained from sources other than Apple's own iTunes App Store. "Jailbreaking" is the term used for removing these restrictions, thereby liberating your phone from Apple's software "jail." Estimates put the number of iPhone owners who have jailbroken their phones in the hundreds of thousands.As part of the 2009 DMCA rulemaking, EFF has asked the Copyright Office to recognize an exemption to the DMCA to permit jailbreaking in order to allow iPhone owners to use their phones with applications that are not available from Apple's store (e.g., turn-by-turn directions, using the iPhone camera for video, laptop tethering).Apple's copyright infringement claim starts with the observation that jailbroken iPhones depend on modified versions of Apple's bootloader and operating system software. True enough -- we said as much in our technical white paper describing the jailbreak process. But the courts have long recognized that copying software while reverse engineering is a fair use when done for purposes of fostering interoperability with independently created software, a body of law that Apple conveniently fails to mention.As for the DMCA violation, Apple casts its lot with the likes of laser printer makers and garage door opener companies who argue that the DMCA entitles them to block interoperability with anything that hasn't been approved in advance. Apple justifies this by claiming that opening the iPhone to independently created applications will compromise safety, security, reliability, and swing the doors wide for those who want to run pirated software.If this sounds like FUD, that's because it is. One need only transpose Apple's arguments to the world of automobiles to recognize their absurdity. Sure, GM might tell us that, for our own safety, all servicing should be done by an authorized GM dealer using only genuine GM parts. Toyota might say that swapping your engine could reduce the reliability of your car. And Mazda could say that those who throw a supercharger on their Miatas frequently exceed the legal speed limit.But we'd never accept this corporate paternalism as a justification for welding every car hood shut and imposing legal liability on car buffs tinkering in their garages. After all, the culture of tinkering (or hacking, if you prefer) is an important part of our innovation economy.Of course, many iPhone owners will be happy to choose solely from the applications that Apple is willing to approve, just like many Ford owners are happy relying exclusively on their local Ford dealer. But if you want to pop the hood, the DMCA surely shouldn't stand in your way.

Apple still hasn’t said a word about the new A6 SoC within the iPhone 5, but no matter: Chipworks — a company that specializes in reverse engineering computer chips — has now completed its initial analysis of the A6, and the results are very interesting indeed. The A6 features a custom, in-house, laid-out-by-hand dual-core design (pictured above) that is neither a Cortex-A9 or A15, and a tri-core GPU.By far the most exciting aspect of this news is the fact that the A6?s dual ARM CPU cores have been manually laid out — an approach that used to be the norm, but which is now almost unheard of outside of Intel (even AMD has given up). Today, chips are nearly always laid out using advanced, CAD-like software — the designer says he wants X cache, Y FPUs, and Z cores, and the software automagically creates a chip. Hand-drawn processors, on the other hand, are painstakingly laid out by chip designers. This approach obviously takes a lot longer (and is a lot more expensive), but if it’s done correctly the end result can be a lot faster.In the case of the A6, which benchmarks very well indeed, it would seem that its chip design department knows what it’s doing. This probably isn’t a big surprise, though, when you remember that Apple acquired PA Semi back in 2008, for the purpose of bolstering the capabilities of its mobile devices. PA Semi was founded by one of DEC’s lead chip designers and has over a hundred engineers who have worked on chips at Intel and AMD, among others. I wouldn’t be surprised if PA Semi has been working on the hand-made A6 since its acquisition.As far as the custom core’s actual functionality, we still don’t have much to go on. At this point, it still looks like the A6?s CPU core is similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 Krait — roughly doubling the performance of the Cortex-A9 chip, while still remaining very power efficient.Now, the tri-core GPU. Chipworks says that the GPU cores Imagination Technologies PowerVR cores — but beyond that, we don’t know exactly what they are. Judging by Apple’s boast of “2x the performance,” we are probably looking at the same SGX543 GPU cores found in the A5 and A5X SoCs, but at a higher clock speed.Beyond the hardware specs, Chipworks’ reverse engineering also confirms that the A6 is produced using Samsung’s 32nm HKMG process, and that the total die size is 9.7mm by 9.97mm (96mm). This is actually quite large, when you bear in mind that the 32nm A5 only had an area of 71mm. The 26-square-millimeter difference is mostly accounted for by the larger, hand-made CPU cores in the A6, and the addition of a third GPU core.Unfortunately, beyond the CPU and GPU cores, Chipworks hasn’t labeled any other SoC features. We know that most of the right and bottom edges are the interface, and the silver squares on the mid-right are PLLs — but beyond that, the other squares are unknown. If you recognize any of the features, leave a comment below.For lots and lots of pretty photos, be sure to hit up Chipworks. Not only have their engineers reverse engineered the A6, they’ve also taken a look at the Sony camera sensor — and over on iFixit, Chipworks has shared some die shots of the Qualcomm MDM9615 radio and the Broadcom WiFi chip.Now read: Scuffgate: Will Apple have to recall the iPhone 5?

Android has supplanted the iPhone as the most desired smartphone. According to a newly released Nielsen survey, 31 percent of consumers who are planning to get a new smartphone have indicated that Android is their operating system of choice. Apple’s iOS, and the iPhone it powers, was preferred by 30 percent of consumers. Nielsen’s survey was conducted from January through March of this year.Those figures represent a shift from a year ago when iOS was a clear favorite among the those in the market for a new smartphone. A similar survey conducted from July through September of 2010 showed that iOS was favored by 33 percent of consumers. Google’s Android attracted just 26 percent of consumers.In less than a year, Android now finds itself as the fairest of them all in the smartphone market. And it’s not just looking pretty. Android is attracting a greater number of sales, too. Half of respondents surveyed last month who had purchased a new smartphone in the last six months spent their money on an Android device. Only a quarter said that they had purchased an iPhone during the same period of time.As it stands now, Android accounts for a majority of the activated smartphones on the market with a 37 percent share. Apple’s iOS claims 27 percent of the market. And as it looks increasingly likely that Apple will forgo its traditional summer launch for the next-generation iPhone, Android may have a golden opportunity to further extend its lead over iOS.Read more: http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/nielsen-android-tops-iphone-in-desirability-among-consumers/#ixzz2CpmKfowe Follow us: @digitaltrends on Twitter | digitaltrendsftw on Facebook

Nokia’s upcoming Lumia 900 Windows Phone could be the first smartphone running Microsoft’s mobile operating system to really make a splash in the United States. BGR exclusively reported that the new flagship 4G handset will hit AT&T store shelves late next month alongside a massive marketing blitz and a big subsidy program that will leave the phone with a surprisingly low $99.99 price tag. As impressive as the Lumia 900 is shaping up to be, however, Nokia is apparently working on another smartphone with new technology that will blow us all away. Read on for more.In an interview with Finnish newspaper Kauppalehti, Nokia design boss Marko Ahtisaari said that the company is currently working on a revolutionary new smartphone that will make other handsets seem dated.According to the Nokia executive, Apple’s user interface on the iPhone is “poorly designed” and convoluted. “The road from the kitchen into the dining room is always through the front door,” Ahtisaari told Kauppalehti. Meanwhile, operating systems like Symbian and Android are described by the design veteran as “dollhouses,” with furniture users can pick and rearrange.Microsoft’s Windows Phone is more natural according to Ahtisaari, and the mysterious new smartphone Nokia is building will apparently push the mobile platform even further into the future.The executive wouldn’t provide any firm details regarding the device, but he didn’t hesitate to set sky-high expectations. The phone will feature breakthrough technology that revolutionizes the user experience according to Ahtisaari, and owners will not have to bend down or even touch the screen in order to operate it.Ahtisaari’s brief description of the technology suggests some type heads-up technology, or perhaps voice-driven controls similar to Apple’s virtual assistant Siri or Microsoft Kinect. We’re not sure how revolutionary voice controls would be be considering how widely voice command technology will be used this year, however. Nokia declined to comment.UPDATE: A Nokia spokesperson contacted BGR with additional details regarding some of Ahtisaari’s comments. The interface elements he described during his interview are in fact concepts Ahtisaari has been discussing since December 2010, when he spoke about them on stage at LeWeb. The spokesperson declined to comment on if or when these concepts might appear in a production device.

On the Hong Kong-to-Singapore leg of my SQ1 flight from San Francisco, a B777 aircraft, an air steward noticed my iPhone connected to the in-seat USB port.He then told me I couldn't charge my iPhone this way. It seems it's not a question of not enough juice in that port but because the USB port does not have a circuit breaker and will keep charging even when the battery is full. Apparently it may overload the circuits or something.I even offered to disconnect my iPhone when it was full but he wouldn't have any of it. So I disconnected my iPhone from the USB port.This is new to me. I have seen many people use it, myself included, without being told off.It seems strange to me that you would design a plane with a USB port that cannot do what normal USB ports on computers do.Anyways, I just switched to charging via the in-seat power socket (good thing I had my iPhone charger head with me).So these SQ USB ports, are they only good for flash drives? Strangely, their Krisworld magazine touts connecting your iPhone to the Krisworld system to access your own movies and music via the in-seat screen and the connection method? The USB port.They did have an asterisk on the iPhone bit that stated "On Selected Aircraft Only". So maybe my B777 was not one of the "Selected Aircraft".Maybe Singapore Airlines can go to Sim Lim Square and pick up new USB ports for these planes. I heard got offer.

It is being reported by Chinese news services that a number of workers at manufacturer Wintek are suffering from n-hexane poisoning.Wintek produces touchscreen displays for Apple’s iPhone and iPod touch devices. As part of that process the screens need to be cleaned, which usually involves alcohol as the cleaning agent. But the chemical n-hexane is also a well-known cleaning chemical used mainly in textile manufacturing, and it looks as though Wintek may have opted to use it.It may be a good cleaner, but it’s quite bad for us humans. In small doses inhalation can lead to euphoria, headaches, and nausea. Long term, however, it is linked to nervous system failure, with early symptoms including cramps and tingling sensations in the arms and legs. Exposure on a daily basis would certainly increase the risk of such symptoms and eventual illness.Reports of n-hexane use and poisoning at Wintek come from China Daily TV (Chinese-language video). It reported 49 Wintek employees received treatment in hospital from August last year for their symptoms. It also seems as if the response has only been to ask Wintek to stop using the chemical and change management.At the moment this seems to be just accusations rather than concrete proof the chemical is being used. However, a couple of months before the employees entered hospital protests were held by the Taiwan Labor Organization over poor working conditions at Wintek. Further protests were also held in January this year.This chemical is refined from crude oil and used in gasoline, glues, leather products, and roofing. So the risk of using it in a factory setting is not only the exposure for humans, but the high possibility of a fire breaking out and spreading very quickly if not handled correctly.Choosing to use n-hexane instead of alcohol may be down to cost or availability. Maybe someone at Wintek managed to get a shipment of n-hexane very cheap and was using it to boost profit margins on what must be large orders coming from Apple. Alternatively, it could have been viewed as the better solution with the risks being overlooked or seen as minimal.If the poisoning and poor working conditions turn out to be true we should expect Apple to take action. The company doesn’t want to be associated with such practices and Wintek may lose its contract. Otherwise guarantees need to be made that future production will follow more stringent rules and the employees effected receive ongoing care. No one wants to buy a gadget that potentially made a worker ill; and possibly for the rest of their lives.

The 21-year-old California man who found a prototype iPhone and then sold it to gadget site Gizmodo.com says he now regrets not attempting to return the phone to its rightful owner.Talking through his lawyer yesterday, he admitted to Wired.com that he was paid by Gizmodo for what he believed was exclusive access to review the iPhone and that the site told him “there was nothing wrong in sharing the phone with the tech press.”“He regrets his mistake in not doing more to return the phone,” says Bornstein’s statement. “Even though he did obtain some compensation from Gizmodo, Brian thought that it was so that they could review the phone.”The finder of the phone has been interviewed by police, but not yet charged. However, the cloud is not gone from over his head just yet.The person who found the phone “is very definitely one of the people who is being looked at as a suspect in theft,” San Mateo County Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe told Wired.com Wednesday. “Assuming there’s ultimately a crime here. That’s what we’re still gauging, is this a crime, is it a theft?”The finder made no direct effort to return the iPhone himself, though reports claim that a friend of his attempted to contact AppleCare to no avail. According to the owners of the bar where it had been found, he never told anyone there that he’d found the phone. If he had, he’d have learned that the Apple engineer who’d lost it had come back to the bar on several occasions to see if it had been found yet.As reported earlier this week, police searched the home of the Gizmodo editor who wrote the story.“This thing has gotten completely, completely out of control,” said the iPhone finder’s lawyer. “He made a mistake… He should have just immediately turned that phone in.”

Barcelona — Today I tried out Opera Mini running on the iPhone, and it kicks Safari’s butt. The folks at Opera have a native version of their browser running on the iPhone, and while there are limits due to the way it is built, for sheer speed of browsing, it has Safari beat.Opera Mini has not yet been submitted to Apple for approval: The demo I saw was of a very mature but unfinished version. But when it does get sent to Apple’s crack team of picky, fickle reviewers, it should, technically at least, pass. The reason that browsers other than those based on Webkit (Safari) aren’t allowed on the iPhone is that Apple bans the running of interpretive code. This means Java, or Flash, or any other runtime is out.Opera Mini gets around this by doing all the rendering on the server – Opera’s servers actually run web browsers – and sending what are essentially pictures to the phone. These “pictures” look and act like regular web pages, only they are 90% smaller. That’s a big deal if you’re using a phone in a country with expensive bandwidth (Russia is a big market for Opera Mini).IPhone users will be more interested in the cost reductions for roaming data use, and in speed. We loaded up the NYT front page in both browsers (Opera’s Phillip Grønvold is pretty good at hitting both “go” buttons at once) and we were up and browsing five or six pages deep with Opera before Safari had even finished the front page. Better, Opera is responsive to zooming and scrolling as soon as the text is up on screen. IPhone users know that this isn’t the case for Mobile Safari.Another speed-up comes from caching. Not caching pages, but keeping the markup file (like we said, they’re not really just pictures) from each page, ready to re-display. This gives instant back-and-forward navigation.There are some quirks. In order to keep things consistent across platforms (Opera Mini is available for almost any modern phone), some iPhone UI conventions are ignored. Copy and paste gets its own custom widgets, although it still talks to the built-in clipboard. In this way it is a little like, say, Photoshop, which has almost identical versions on Windows and OS X, even if the OS X version annoys many Mac users with its UI.If Opera makes it through the Apple approval process, I’ll be grabbing it right away. The speed makes it perfect the kind of fast reading you do on a phone. And it has one feature that will surely make Apple warm to it: because it doesn’t support video of any kind, Opera Mini won’t display Flash.

Njection Mobile announced that they soon will be allowing for companies to push discounts and coupons through their free Njection Mobile (NMobile)[iTunes] iPhone application for use for their members. What would this mean?  It could mean a boon for local businesses and major retailers and a withdraw from local newspapers and old school paper coupon mailers. If you recall, NMobile already uses GPS to mark and locate speed traps around the world. Adding on to their business model by adding GPS location-based coupons appears to be a perfect fit. Participating stores can sign up their locations via the website and have them geocoded for use on the NMobile network. At that point, vendors can create coupons they want to attach to a store and generate barcodes that will appear on the phone. There are several different bar code types that are currently in use ranging from UPC-A and E bar codes  used for all retail products to EAN bar code that is used in Europe. NMobile searches you area for the best deals and displays a scannable coupon on your iPhone.  Say goodbye to newspaper inserts.  Coupons are used to get people inside of the stores and track the effectiveness of different kinds of promotions.  10% off for different product and services can encourage people to buy other items at that location with the savings they get with the offers they receive. There have been several reports of people using the iPhone for a boarding pass for air plane flights so one would conclude using it for coupons wouldn't be any different. One of the issues that Njection has to overcome is the use of two different ways that coupons can be redeemed. One way is the more traditional way is to produce a barcode on the screen of the cell phone and allow the scanner at the store to scan the face of the cell phone to register the transaction.  However, because of the reflective surface of the iPhone, some laser scanners may not allow the scan to take place but most CCD bar code readers will see it just fine. To work around that setback, the second way is to allow for a confirmation code to be entered into the phone to register the transaction as well. All of the stats and transactions are tracked anonymously online and allow for business to quickly measure the effectiveness of their promotions.NMobile's Njection Ads Finds You The Best Local Deals, Gets You The BarcodeSo there you have it, another nail in the coffin for print media advertising. Njection Mobile says they'll be launching the application officially on July 20th, just in time for the back to school shopping season.  And this is just the beginning, since GPS technology is pretty much ubiquitous for the smartphone handset arena.  We're told the company is eyeballing Windows Mobile, Blackberry, Palm and Android versions as well.  Ladies and Gentlemen, start your shopping engines now.  The application is free, so it's a no brainer.

Skype is set to launch its iPhone application Tuesday, bringing its much-anticipated Net-based phone service to Apple's mobile platform. With the Skype iPhone app, users will be able to make free calls using Wi-Fi to other Skype users as well as use their Skype accounts to make reduced price calls to traditional landline phones. Skype announced its iPhone application will be available on Tuesday for free, with a version for the BlackBerry available in May. Mobile versions of Skype are already available for Nokia, Windows Mobile, and Google Android phones.From what we can tell, the Skype for iPhone looks great; but it has some drawbacks. One disappointment is that users won't be able to place calls over cellular networks, but only via Wi-Fi. Still, for international callers especially, Skype's iPhone app will save callers money by allowing them to avoid AT&T's traditional wireless phone network and adds the convenience of allowing Skype users to use their iPhone handset for Skype calls.Looking more like a traditional iPhone app rather than the desktop Windows counterpart most of its 400 million users are used to, Skype for iPhone features five tabs at the bottom of the screen, displaying contacts, chats, a calling panel, call history, and your profile (with Facebook-style status).Skype for iPhone will use phone numbers directly from your phone's address book, so no more nasty duplicated contact lists. It even displays your contacts' photos (if they have one set up on Skype). Conference calling is available, but for the moment you can only take part in one if someone invites you.You can also chat with your Skype friends, but unfortunately this is the only thing (besides seeing who's online) you can do over a cellular network. Skype for iPhone places calls only via Wi-Fi, not differentiating itself much from the other voice apps in the App Store (Skype for T-Mobile G1 can place calls over 3G).Skype for iPhone is still a young app and is short on some of the features its desktop counterparthas. SMS, video and proper conference calling, file transfer, and voicemail are missing from this first version, but let's hope they will make their way in future versions.iPod Touch users will also be able to enjoy Skype, but this would require them to purchase a microphone, or headphones with built-in microphones (like the iPhone's).

Apple was warned as long ago as 2010 that the popular Gowalla location-sharing iPhone app was uploading users' address books without alerting them, Technology Review has learned.This raises questions about why Apple didn't do then what it announced it would do yesterday. In a statement, the company said software upgrades for iPhones would be issued to protect users from the practice, which is forbidden.Apple's statements follow a series of revelations over the past week concerning apps that access users' address books. The revelations began when an independent developer discovered that the two-million-user-strong social network Path collects users' address books, assembling vast collections of names, e-mails, and phone numbers without consent. Others found that some other popular apps, including the location-sharing services Foursquare and Gowalla, do the same. Transmitting and storing users' address books exposes them to an increased risk of their personal data being leaked, perhaps through an attack like the one that extracted credit-card details from Sony last year.The criticism that followed these discoveries—compounded by evidence that Apple ignored a warning about such behavior from academic researchers in 2010—has led to calls for the company to alter iOS and reform its famously opaque application approval process.In the longer term, all smart-phone operating systems may need more effective privacy controls to better explain what personal data they collect, and to let users opt out. Google's Android mobile operating system already requires apps to receive explicit permission to access contact books or other private data, but app makers do not need to explain how that information will be stored or used, and many users seem not to fully understand what they are handing over.In 2010, graduate student Manuel Egele and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara, used a tool called PiOS to scan 1,400 iPhone applications for signs that they leaked sensitive user data. PiOS flagged Gowalla's app because it stealthily uploaded a user's entire address book to the company's servers when a user viewed his or her list of phone contacts through the app.That was a clear breach of user privacy, and of Apple's own rules for inclusion in the App Store, says Egele, now a postdoctoral researcher at UCSB. But when Apple was contacted about it, a series of representatives showed little interest, he says. "We even took screenshots that showed it was being sent unencrypted," he says. "They said, 'If you have a privacy concern, you should contact the developer.' " Egele and colleagues presented a peer-reviewed paper on the work, including an account of their Gowalla finding, last year.Apple did not reply to inquiries about the 2010 incident. But its first public statement on the address-book saga, made yesterday, implied that it had only just become aware of the issue.

Microsoft and Nokia announced the flagship Windows Phone handset, the Nokia Lumia 920, at a press event in New York City on Wednesday. Just like the lack of grounding that plagued the end of the announcement (no pricing, dates, or availability information), the presenters on the show floor were extremely stingy when it came to letting us get our paws on the device. But we got a few touches in.The yellow and red Lumia 920 both have glossy plastic bodies, while the black uses a matte finish (not quite as rubberized as the Lumia 900). The screens are curved glass, and the top and bottom edges don't have the same taper as the Lumia 900 did.The Lumia 920 is a bit larger in both directions, to accommodate the slightly larger 4.5-inch screen. While none of the phones shown were final production models, the screen seemed to have poor viewing angles when rotated top to bottom; side-to-side, we saw very little dimming.We only saw two demos on the show floor, one of which demonstrated the NFC capabilities of various charging and audio accessories for the Lumia 920. All worked as promised: touch the phone to the surface and it either starts charging or pairs automatically with the set of headphones or speaker for music playback.A second demo for the camera exhibited the low-light capabilities of the camera, with photos taken with flash, without flash on the Lumia 920's PureView camera, and without flash on a competing smartphone camera. The PureView camera's low-light performance did make it much easier to see the subject of the photo as well as her surroundings.However, with that feature turned on, it was impossible to tell that the photo was taken at night, which was a bit disorienting to us. It also created phantom light sources, as if there were a floodlight shining a few feet in front of the subject. Likewise, the sky was an apocalyptic white, yet seemed to cast no light on the subject.(Update: the integrity of several of Nokia's demo photos for the Lumia 920 has been called into question. Youssef Sarhan has pointed out that certain photos purportedly taken with the Lumia 920 have some graphic impossibilities, and GSMArena has claimed the park photos above to be suspect, precisely because of the unusual lighting sources we noted. Nokia has already admitted to and apologized for using a simulated demo video for the Lumia 920's image stabilization, but has yet to address the images. We've reached out for comment on this matter.)In a real-life demo, a presenter invited us to take a picture in a dark, enclosed space with our own iPhone 4S, to compare to a shot he took with the Lumia 920. The difference in results was very impressive.Whatever positive notes the Lumia 920 may have, it still seems like little more than a pipe dream to us without pricing, concrete release dates, or availability info. Microsoft has promised to release this info in the fourth quarter of this year.The first PureView camera in the Nokia PureView 808 clocked in at a whopping 41 megapixels. But Nokia has been insisting that PureView is not about specific camera hardware or megapixel count; it's about using hardware and software to produce the best possible photographs. The camera in the Lumia 920 may disappoint those who were hoping for another 41 megapixels to oversample, but the Lumia 920 arguably makes up for this with impressive low-light photography. As we are now a developed civilization and spend a good deal of our time indoors, a camera that excels at low light has enormous appeal, particularly for night owls, barflies, and party-goers. It may not grab the same headlines, but it could well be more useful.

The bizarre gathering, which morphed into a spirited Michael Jackson "Thriller" dance routine, marked the completion of its Windows Phone 7 software, and showed how badly Microsoft wants to resurrect itself in the viciously competitive phone market.The new software, which will be publicly unveiled on October 11 and expected on handsets in stores by November, is Microsoft's last chance, some analysts say, to catch up with Apple and Google Inc's Android smartphones, after squandering its strong market position in only a few years.A group of smartphone manufacturers including Samsung and HTC Corp are expected to roll out Microsoft-based phones for the holiday season.Whether they will be good enough to render the iPhone obsolete is the question."The product can't be an also-ran that just does everything that is already out in the marketplace," said Bryan Keane, an analyst for Alpine Mutual Funds, which holds Microsoft shares. "Right now, it isn't apparent that Windows 7 is better than anything that's out there, except that it might have a better tie-in to the actual Windows platform."By the admission of Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, the company "missed a generation" with Windows Mobile, its last phone operating system, which floundered while the iPhone and Android roared past with sumptuous touch screens and a host of new applications.Microsoft is now fourth in the fast-growing U.S. market for smartphone operating systems with a share of less than 12 percent, according to research firm comScore, behind BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd, Apple and Google.Microsoft's strange disappearance from the phone market, and its delayed response to the emergence of tablet devices like Apple's iPad, has been seen as a drag on Microsoft's shares, which are down 20 percent this year."The market is really fearful of their positioning in those two markets (phones and tablets)," said Ken Allen, Baltimore-based portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, which holds Microsoft shares. "Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock."Investors were not impressed with Microsoft's last attempt to launch a new phone, the Kin, which was dropped after fewer than three months on the market.Whether the new phones can make up for that error and lift concerns will depend on how the handsets measure up and how much the network carriers promote the phones.Prototypes of the new devices, which have been demonstrated by Microsoft employees over the past few months, look to be a huge improvement over the last version of Microsoft's phone software. They have a touch-screen interface resembling the company's Zune music player and movable 'tiles' that access various phone functions.But at first glance, they don't appear to offer radical new features that rivals lack.Launch phones are expected from Samsung, LG and HTC Corp, while AT&T Inc is expected to be the initial U.S. network provider, according to a person familiar with the launch plans. Microsoft and AT&T declined comment. None of the handset makers immediately replied to requests for details.All three of those phone makers already offer Android-based phones, while AT&T is currently the sole carrier for the iPhone, which means none has too much riding on the success of the new software, which could be a problem for Microsoft."We'll have to see how much vendor support (Microsoft) gets behind it -- that was partially what drove Android success," said Keane at Alpine. "But now, their problem is, 'We already have Android and the iPhone, do we need a third one?'."

NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Despite a very vocal group of detractors, the vast majority of iPhone users love AT&T.That's the key finding in a survey released this week by Yankee Group, which reports that 73% of iPhone users are very satisfied with AT&T's service. That rating compares favorably to how non-iPhone smartphone users feel about AT&T, and even to how non-iPhone users feel about other wireless providers.The satisfaction rate of AT&T subscribers as a whole is 68%, and only 69% of smartphone users say they are satisfied with their mobile provider, Yankee Group found.The results are surprising, given the pounding AT&T has taken in the media and on the blogosphere about its service-related issues with the iPhone. On CNNMoney's recent stories "AT&T and Apple's marriage made in hell," and "AT&T: The most hated company in iPhone land," reader comments were overwhelmingly negative toward the wireless network.AT&T's recent iPad-related security glitch and mishandling of the iPhone 4 launch likely didn't do much to help its reputation. Plus, iPhone owners pay AT&T nearly $12 a month more for service than the average smartphone user.Tech analysts like to point out the ways in which AT&T is a drag on the iPhone. Gartner Research Director Carolina Milanesi said last month that AT&T's network has "limited the iPhone experience." And Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport & Co., forecasted that poor experiences with AT&T would drive as many as 40% of iPhone customers to Verizon once that network gets the iPhone.So what explains Yankee Group's conclusion that iPhone users' love AT&T?"Consumers transfer the high gloss of their Apple iPhone experience to AT&T," says Carl Howe, Yankee Group analyst and author of the study. "The iPhone creates a halo effect that rubs off."In other words, iPhone customers' praise for their network may be a result of the famous "reality distortion field" that surrounds Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) CEO Steve Jobs and his company's products.But AT&T says its network really isn't as bad as many people think. It's a perception problem, not a service problem, in the company's eyes."There's a gap between what people hear about us and what their experience is with us. We think that gap is beginning to close," says Mark Siegel, an AT&T spokesman. "It doesn't mean we're perfect; we still have work to do. But that's no surprise to us, because we have a great network."AT&T's 'problem' that everyone wantsMeanwhile, AT&T (T, Fortune 500) continues to reap the rewards of being the country's exclusive iPhone provider.Despite heavy data demands that drive up AT&T's cost of servicing each customer, users still make the wireless company $50 more per customer each year than other providers get from their smartphone subscribers, according to Yankee Group. That's because a higher percentage of iPhone customers buy pricey, top-tier service plans to satisfy their mobile download demands.The iPhone will be worth $1.8 billion in sales to AT&T this year, and will generate $9 billion in revenue for the provider over the next five years, the study estimates. Yankee Group says that's $750 million more each year than AT&T would be taking in if it had a different flagship smartphone.The iPhone is also the gift that keeps on giving: 77% of iPhone owners say they'll buy another iPhone, compared to 20% of smartphone customers who say they'll buy an Android phone."Our analysis explains why AT&T has bent over backward to keep its exclusive distribution deal with Apple as long as possible," Howe says. "Verizon has been regretting turning away Apple for the last three years."

A Scottish IP firm is suing Apple over the smooth zooming and scrolling featured on the iPhone.Glasgow-based patent licenser Picsel Technologies says the Cupertino iDevice maker illegally uses display technologies it developed. The firm sued Apple on Friday in Delaware District Court.Picsel claims Apple infringes on its US patent 7,009,626, titled "Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing."The patent describes using an approximate, intermediary rendering of what's displayed on a device while scrolling, zooming, or during other major screen transitions.For example, if a user zooms into a particular object on a device's web browser, the transition is done by showing an approximation of what the final display will look like using scaled data from the page before the zoom.Picsel claims it has spent millions of dollars developing the technology for the patent, which the USPTO approved on March 7, 2006.The company also alleges that Apple knowingly and deliberately infringes on patent '626 with devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, although the initial complaint doesn't provide evidence for this claim.Picsel says the IP has been baked into more than 200 million devices worldwide. Its website lists companies like Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, Panasonic, Palm, HP, Motorola, and Nokia as licensing partners.It appears many of the technologies the firm makes are produced in-house - not collected from other inventors.The complaint asks for a block on allegedly infringing Apple products, unspecified damages, that patent damages be increased to three times the amount awarded, and attorneys fees.A copy of the lawsuit is available here. ®

Thanks for the memoriesApple has cut down its order of memory chips from Samsung, reducing its reliance on its smartphone rival for components, say supply chain sources cited by Reuters.The iPhone 5, widely expected to be announced next week, will feature fewer Samsung components than its predecessors, say the sources.Samsung manufactures the A5 and A5X processors at the heart of the iPhone 4S and iPads 2 and 3, but the RAM layer in the chip package will no longer be from Samsung, and the NAND flash memory used in iPad, iPhone and iPod will be from elsewhere too.Instead Apple has increased orders of DRAM chips and NAND flash memory from SK Hynix, Toshiba and Elpida Memory – which are all existing contractors.We already knew that the new iPhone 5 will feature fewer Samsung components, with the screen manufactured by Sharp and LG for the first time, but this means that the memory will come from elsewhere too. Samsung is still expected to make the main processor for the phone.Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of memory chips in the world - recently investing £4bn in its chip-making plant in Austin, Texas, where the A5 chips are made.It will be a welcome move for Toshiba at least. In July, the world's second biggest NAND chip-maker announced a 30 per cut in flash memory chip production, pinned at the time on market oversupply and declining prices.In April this year, Apple reported that it was committed to £11bn in parts and component expenditure. ®

Several versions of Apple's iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have potentially serious security problems, a German government agency said in an official warning Wednesday.Apple's iOS operating system has "two critical weak points for which no patch exists," the Federal Office for Information Security said.Opening a manipulated website or a PDF file could allow criminals to spy on passwords, planners, photos, text messages, e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations, the agency said in a statement."This allows potential attackers access to the complete system, including administrator rights," it added, urging users not to open PDF files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until Apple Inc. publishes a software update.A spokesman for Apple in Germany, Georg Albrecht, told The Associated Press that the company is looking into the matter."We know these reports and are investigating them," he said, refusing to elaborate.Although no attacks have been observed yet they were likely to appear soon, the German agency said."It has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks," it said, noting that the devices' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world.The warning relates to iPhones using iOS versions 3.1.2-4.0.1., iPads using iOS 3.2-3.2.1 and iPods Touch using iOS 3.1.2.-4.0.The agency said it was possible but not clear whether older iOS or iPhone OS versions could also be affected.The federal agency, based in Bonn, said it was in contact with Apple on the issue.

There's plenty of talk making the rounds about Steve Jobs' comments about Android in the authorized biography that's coming out next week. In it, Jobs apparently makes it clear that he was absolutely furious about Android "ripping off" the iPhone. According to the summary in the Huffington Post:This is coming from Steve Jobs, who was inspired by the graphical user interface he saw at Xerox PARC and turned that into the Macintosh. Now, as we've noted before, what Jobs was always great at doing wasn't just taking an idea and copying it, but making it better . But, many would argue that's the same thing that Google has done with Android. Yes, they clearly took inspiration from the iPhone, but there are some key differences, which many people enjoy. In fact, Steve Jobs pretty much admitted this very fact earlier this year when some of the iPhone's upgrades appeared to be copied directly from Android And that's kind of the point: part of the way innovation works is that you build on the works of others. That doesn't just mean wholesale copying, but trying to take what works and improve on it -- or take what doesn't work well and figure out a way to make it work better. Steve Jobs did this many, many times, but so have Google and many other companies. It seems rather hypocritical to get all bent out of shape because others are doing the same thing. Along those lines, Daring Fireball links to a wonderful discussion on this topic by designer Brian Ford, who discusses the idea of "artists copying or stealing" from one another. I completely agree with those points. It's quite similar to an earlier post we did about the importance of getting it right rather than being first, which pointed to a wonderful comic from Scott Meyer's Basic Instructions that included this panel: So I'm at a loss as to Jobs' complaint against Android. At best, the only logical way to view his complaint is that he was upset that Google didn't do on top of the idea of the iPhone to make Android completely its own. But I think that's more of a difference in philosophy. Steve Jobs came from a very top down world view, in which the brilliant designers (him, Jonathan Ive, etc.) designed everything perfectly. Google's world view seems to be more about setting up the system, and then letting others design the improvements. That's messier, clunkier, and a hell of a lot uglier at first. But in the long run, I think it tends to lead to much greater innovation. Just not the kind of innovation you unveil as "and one more thing..." In the end, the best way to sum all this up comes from the T.S. Eliot quote that Ford puts at the end of his blog post. Many people have heard the paraphrased version (often copied and attributed to others) that "good artists copy, great artists steal." But the full T.S. Eliot quote is much more interesting and nuanced:

I updated my iPhone 4S earlier today (using the OTA method), and I discovered a nasty bug. My iPhone could no longer remember the names of any of my contacts! I opened up the contacts app on my phone and discovered that all of entries were still there but if I got a text or a call my iPhone would have a sudden bout of amnesia and forget the contacts name.It’s even more bizarre when you’re trying to create a new text. In the example above I texted Erin Hontz. After I selected her as the contact, I wrote my message and hit send. In the message pane (pictured on the right) it would forget my contact’s name and just show the number.I mentioned this on Twitter and many of my followers had similar experiences.• Use the Delta Update (The OTA version) • Be on an iPhone 4S (I haven’t had reports with the 4) • Be On VerizonDisabling (and re-enabling) iCloud contacts did not solve the issue.Have you had any issues upgrading to iOS 5.0.1?This method fixed my incoming calls but not incoming text messages. Your milage may vary. via TSF reader James Foster1) Open the Phone and dial *228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number. 2) When the system answer press 1 for “Program or activate your phone” 3) Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, “Settings updated.” 4) Open the Task Manager (double click the home button) and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications 5) Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe) 6) Open the Message App to verify the fix.If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.

The next time you’re at a concert and you whip out your iPhone to record  the excitement, you may notice it doesn’t work. During the show you keep trying to turn it on but for some reason it just won't light-up.But miraculously when you go outside when the concert is over, your phone all of a sudden works again. This can happen to you at the next concert you attend or maybe inside the next movie theater you go to.Apple has received a patent that would allow the company to turn off its mobile devices in areas that are deemed inappropriate for recording or taking pictures. The new technology would also have the ability to shut down communication functions in devices, so people couldn’t text or make phone calls if they’re in areas that are considered sensitive.Many believe this new patent could be a good thing, as it can remove the power from movie bootleggers or cut off communication from a group of up-to-no-gooders in an airport let’s say, but it could also harm the public’s ability to document wrongdoing.Remember the kids who were pepper-sprayed at the University of California Davis during the Occupy Wall Street rallies? The students were sitting peacefully but were sprayed at close range, while hundreds of smartphones filmed the incident, which was eventually broadcast around the world.Well, this type of amateur-video journalism could be halted, as certain entities could have the power to abruptly shut off your phone during protest marches, rallies or political gatherings. Those same entities could also just block off satellite signals so you couldn’t get smartphone access in certain places.The federal government along with Apple could arbitrarily decide what areas or public functions would be considered sensitive or restricted. Some believe the amount of subjectivity that goes into making such a decision is as big as the sea, which is the reason they're concerned about this new technology.Although the patent was granted, Apple would still need the okay from the  government to implement the technology, but the company is well on its way to using it in the near future.Some have already expressed concern over not being able to monitor police action, especially during public protests."Covert police government operations may require complete ‘blackout’ conditions," said the patent. "The wireless transmission of sensitive information to a remote source is one of the examples of a threat to security. This sensitive information could be anything from classified government information to questions or answers to an examination administered in an academic setting.”Apple also noted having the ability to shut off smartphones is ideal for professional and some social settings, where devices could easily bother many people at once.“As wireless devices such as cellular telephones, pagers, personal media devices and smartphones become ubiquitous, more and more people are carrying these devices in various social and professional settings,” it says in the patent. “The result is that these wireless devices can often annoy, frustrate, and even threaten people in sensitive venues.”Apple also says smartphones should be disabled within photography darkrooms and biological labs, where light can destroy what’s being worked on.Apple also says the new technology can help drivers as they attempt to use their devices on the road. The company says the smartphone’s communication function could be temporarily deactivated when entering your car or when you're driving in certain areas. Devices would be manipulated by GPS signals and satellites.Now just which entities will have the authority to deem areas sensitive remains to be seen. Whether it’s only Apple, areas of the U.S. government, or local police departments, setting up the technology nationwide is challenging, but extremely doable.The fact that Apple has already been granted a patent by the governent, shows that having your smartphone manipulated by someone other than yourself could be happening sooner than you think.

Let’s step into a time machine and travel through the mists of chronos to an ancient yesteryear. It was a different era, Britney Spears shaved her head, Boris Yeltsin died, and people learned how to print images on toast from the comfort of their own workshops. Oh, and a lil’ thing called an iPhone came out. The year was 2007, and Verizon and Sprint were so scared that they issued these ridiculous sheets to their frontline reps with talking points for discouraging people from buying an iPhone:“Touch screen: It sounds cool, but if you’re a heavy text or email user, it could be challenging not being able to feel the keys as you press them. And how are you going to type without looking with a keyboard you can’t even feel.” “Sorry, iPhone can’t send picture or video message — only e-mail. No over-the-air downloads. You have to connect to a PC to load music.” “Wi-Fi is not a mobile technology. You have to be in a fixed location to use it — and that’s if you know where to find it. And some Wi-Fi hotspots make you pay to use them. There’re also those pesky concerns about security of Wi-Fi.”“The iPhone is an Apple product and has some nice features. It also has a nice price. Do you really need all those features in one device?” “Are you sure 4G or 8G is enough storage for you? To give you a comparison, most iPods/MP3 players hold 40 to 60Gigs or more.” “Using the iPhone on the GSM/EDGE network may be like having a really powerful computer on dial up.”Ok, that last one turned out to be true.

Last year, InfoGear Technology got plenty of oohs and ahs for its iPhone, a telephone that could let you surf the Web.But the device's slow modem, hard-to-read screen, and high price didn't attract many buyers -- only about 15,000 active users, according to InfoGear Chief Executive Officer Ed Cluss.Enter the new iPhone, which addresses the most common complaints about the first model. "This is the phone they should have built the first time out," says analyst David Coursey, editor of the Coursey.com e-mail newsletter.The iPhone features an integrated Web browser, tiltable 7.4-inch gray scale touchscreen, an e-mail client, a 56-kilobits-per-second modem, two phone jacks, a full duplex speaker phone, and a keyboard that slides under the phone to save space. Hardware for a digital answering machine is also built in, although that functionality won't be available until later this summer via a software upgrade, available over the Internet.The iPhone's current fifth-generation software is much easier to install than PC software -- in fact, InfoGear says, there's no real installation. When a new application is available, an icon appears on the iPhone's screen. Press the icon and the new software is transferred to the system, a process that takes a minute and a half at most, according to Cluss.InfoGear doesn't set the price for the iPhone, but defers to its resellers. For Internet service, InfoGear refers customers to Big Planet, but you can also go with your own service provider. Big Planet is also InfoGear's preferred online retailer; it lists the iPhone for $299, plus service plans.Even though the low end of the PC market is in the same price range as the iPhone, and threatening to drop further, Cluss says he isn't worried. "The reason low-cost PCs aren't in more homes than they are already is ease of use and support issues," says Cluss. "People are worried about having to upgrade and breaking the PC. We're very focused on these issues and we've tried to create a simple, reliable device."The market for information appliances like iPhone is set to explode, by some analysts' reckoning. "Consumers are looking to obtain the benefits of the Internet without the bulk, the complexity, and cost of the PC," says Sean Kaldor, a vice president with research firm International Data Corporation. "1999 will be a formative year for Internet screen phones as numerous companies such as InfoGear come to market in response to consumers' needs for fast, easy, and convenient access to the Internet."While some of the iPhone's advantages sound a lot like a marketing pitch for WebTV -- it provides convenient, low-cost access to the Internet and e-mail -- Cluss says the iPhone addresses a different set of needs."PCs and TVs are things that people tend to sit down and watch for hours at a time," says Cluss. "The idea for the iPhone is that it sits in a heavily trafficked area of the house, like an entry way or the kitchen, and you typically will spend three to seven minutes on it, checking or sending off an e-mail, getting a weather report and so on."While WebTV tries to appeal to newbies, Cluss says most iPhone users already own a PC. "The iPhone is for people who have an oven," says Cluss, "and now they want a microwave."Cluss also argues the iPhone is a more private device because it lets you can dash off a short e-mail or read a message in private, whereas a desktop PC or a WebTV device uses a display that's viewable by anyone in the room.The iPhone can't handle streaming media or multimedia games. "You can go anywhere you want to on the Internet using the iPhone, but you can't play Quake or run multimedia applications. It wasn't designed for that," says Cluss.

In an effort to get around Apple's ban on rival browsers for its iPhone, Mozilla plans to offer a Firefox application that will give users access to their browser bookmarks and history. The app will also let users open tabs from their most recent Firefox sessions.The Firefox Home app is a spin-off of the bookmark and tab synchronization technology Mozilla currently offers as an add-on for the Firefox desktop browser. Mozilla will submit the free application to the App Store within the next three weeks. Sadly, Mozilla has no way to know when or if the app will be approved and available to users, so it's hard to say when we'll be able to get our hands on this app.Firefox Home Coming Soon to the iPhoneWe have been working on an application for the iPhone based on the Firefox Sync (formerly Weave Sync) technology. The app is called Firefox Home, and it gives iPhone users instant access to their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks and the set of tabs from their most recent browser session. What’s more, it provides Firefox “Awesome Bar” capability that enables people to get to their favorite web sites with minimal typing.Firefox Home provides an amazing “get up and go” experience. It’s encrypted end-to-end. It’s your home on the Web, wherever you are. And, of course, it’s free.Firefox Home for iPhone is part of a broader Mozilla effort to provide a more personal Web experience with more user control. For devices or platforms where we’re unable to provide the “full” Firefox browser (either technically or due to policy), we aim to provide users with “on the go” instant access to their personal Firefox history, bookmarks and open tabs on their iPhones, giving them another reason to keep loving Firefox on their desktops.Why is this useful?

And so it begins. The so-called iPhone 4 "death grip" has resulted in a class-action lawsuit, filed Wednesday on behalf of two Maryland residents who accused Apple and AT&T of negligence, fraud, and deceptive trade practices, among other things.Kevin McCaffrey and Linda Wrinn pre-ordered the iPhone 4 on June 15 and said the devices they received were "defective.""[They] have experienced numerous dropped calls, and as a result, [they] are left with a device that cannot be used for the normal purpose and in the normal manner in which such devices are intended to be used," according to court documents.Two more class-action lawsuits were filed in San Francisco a day earlier, separate cases that also alleged that Apple shipped the iPhone 4 with an unannounced defect, Bloomberg reported.The iPhone 4 started shipping to customers in late June. Reports soon emerged that holding the phone with fingers covering the three black lines on the phone's edge and the bottom left corner caused its data reception to plummet. This "iPhone 4 death grip" was replicated in the PCMag Labs, but Apple later said that "gripping any phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance."Placing a cover on the device apparently eliminates death grip issues. Apple is also reportedly prepping a software update that will alleviate connection problems.Steve Jobs also weighed in on the death grip rumors. An Engadget reader e-mailed the Apple chief executive complaining that he loses reception when he places his hands on the steel bands. "Just avoid holding it that way," Jobs responded.That e-mail exchange made its way into Wednesday's class-action lawsuit, which also mentions a similar response to a Gizmodo reader as evidence of Apple's negligence.McCaffrey and Wrinn both pre-ordered two iPhone 4's on or around June 15. McCaffrey received his on June 24; Wrinn received hers three days ago."Almost immediately after the purchase of their iPhone 4 devices, both McCaffrey and Wrinn began to experience significantly reduced reception and performance when handling the phones as demonstrated in Apple's advertisements or as a reasonable person would handle a mobile telephone while making phone calls, browsing the Internet, sending text messages, or utilizing other services provided by the iPhone 4," the suit said.The suit pointed to advertisements promising improved reception and improved service overall as examples of both companies' deceptive trade practices.The duo cannot return their phones without incurring a re-stocking fee, the court said. Apple charges a 10 percent re-stocking fee on any opened hardware or accessory, according to its Web site.As a result, McCaffrey and Wrinn are suing for damages "and other remedies."Overall, the suit accuses Apple of defect in design, manufacturer, and assembly as well as breach of express warranty. Apple and AT&T are accused of general negligence, breach of warranty, deceptive trade practices, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud by concealment.In related news, there are also rumors that a California lawsuit is prepping an iPhone 4 class-action suit of its own. Gawker posted a link to the Web site for law firm Kershaw, Cutter & Ratinoff, which is looking for people who are having iPhone 4 reception problems.This is not the first reception-related lawsuit Apple has faced over the iPhone. In August 2008, an Alabama woman filed a class-action lawsuit against Apple over reception and speed problems with the iPhone 3G. That was followed by another suit in September 2008, which cited the same issues.Editor's Note: This story was updated at 11:47 AM PT with details of the additional lawsuits.

Apple could be just days away from becoming the subject of an unpleasant antitrust inquiry into a recent decision to restrict software development on the iPhone and iPad. Nevermind Apple’s moral policing which always ignites the heated debate among our readers, this is a much more serious issue than app rejections, the one with potentially far-reaching implications for the Californian firm.From Apple’s perspective, they are entitled to define user experience on the iPhone platform which is – mind you – neither open-sourced nor open in the Android sense. Apple’s unmatched ability to create gadgets that “just work” stems from their tight control of the entire widget, including software, hardware, apps, services, and user interfaces. Take this control away from Apple and you have just another gadget vendor that builds dull products.The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is thinking different about such a closed ecosystem. According to New York Post, Apple could be “in the eye of regulatory storm” and might even face an antitrust probe over its lock out on iPad and iPhone. A source “familiar with the matter” told the publication that:The inquiry could pave the way for a fully-fledged investigation if the agencies conclude that Apple’s controversial decision to prohibit app development does in fact stifle competition. According to Steve Jobs’ widely publicized rambling titled “Thoughts on Flash,” Apple sees third party cross-development tools as a big no-no because they lead to “sub-standard apps and hinder the enhancement and progress” of the platform. It’s a fight for developers’ resources because programmers must choose between “developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously,” New York Post noted.Developers with limited budgets are hurt the most because their focus on iPhone inevitably comes at the expense of other platforms. Jobs has a point, too, because cross-development tools do enable only the lowest common denominator set of features, as he summed it up nicely:If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers. This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor’s platforms.Apple’s our-way-or-the-highway approach makes sense from their way of doing things.  By the way, Adobe’s shares dipped two percent the day Apple published that piece. We’ll find out soon if the DoJ and FTC can establish the case against Apple, but we can help but wonder who’s next?Probe Microsoft because Windows doesn’t run Linux apps? Go after Sony because it only sells Sony Pictures movies on Playstation Network? Bring movie studios to justice because we aren’t allowed to watch FairPlay-DRM’d iTunes movies on non-Apple devices? Hit Adobe because its Flash is killing the prospect of open videos? Meet us in comments.Read more at New York Post

A new "jailbreak" for the iPhone 3GS and iPad was released this weekend by hackers, and allows users to run third-party software with features not authorized by Apple, including multitasking.Dubbed "Spirit," the software for Windows and Mac OS X allows users to jailbreak their iPhone OS device , including firmware 3.1.2, 3.1.3, and the iPad-exclusive 3.2. The practice of jailbreaking allows users to run code not approved by Apple on their mobile device. The hack was released by a coder who goes by the handle "comex," and is a member of the Dev Team group. They, along with George "Geohot" Hotz, are the most high-profile hackers of the iPhone OS. The Spirit jailbreak was first demonstrated on the iPad in early April. The release was delayed until after the iPad 3G went on sale last Friday to ensure it would work with the new hardware. The jailbreak installs Cydia, an unauthorized digital storefront that is the hackers' equivalent of Apple's own App Store. It includes unauthorized software such as "Backgrounder," which allows users to run more than one application at once. Early reports indicate that Backgrounder works on the iPad, though most other Cydia software created for the iPhone must be updated to run on the larger 9.7-inch screen. Previously, many iPhone 3GS users could only use a "tethered" jailbreak released by Hotz. This method meant users of the latest iPod touch, and any iPhone 3GS released in October 2009 or later, could not perform a hardware reset of the phone without connecting it via USB cable to a computer. The Spirit jailbreak is not tethered. Last year, Apple updated the BootROM for the iPhone 3GS to iBoot-359.32 in a mid-cycle hardware release in October -- the first time ever that the handset maker modified its hardware in the middle of a product line, without a new model released. That update has slowed hackers in their ongoing game of cat and mouse with Apple. Apple and the jailbreaking community have gone back and forth for some time, as the Cupertino, Calif., company has looked to close avenues used by hackers. One of Apple's main concerns about jailbreaking is piracy, as the procedure can allow users to steal software from the App Store, in addition to running unauthorized third-party applications.

Apple on Monday rested its case that Samsung ripped off the design of the iPhone and iPad while building its own mobile products. Meanwhile, three of the Samsung phones that Apple labeled as infringing were tossed from the trial.It was a minor victory for Samsung. The Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S i9000, and Galaxy S II i9100 were thrown out of the case by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh after questions about whether the phones were even sold in the US. The devices were dropped from the case because they are “world phones that could be purchased in the US., but that weren't sold by Samsung's telecommunications and electronics divisions in the US,” according to CNET.All Things D points out, however, that the ruling does not affect the US-specific versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S and Galaxy SII phones, which are among roughly 20 devices Apple has identified as infringing its intellectual property. Moreover, the three phones were essentially worthless in Apple's case from a financial perspective. Apple's damages report assigned the three phones a worth of $0, the only phones in the case with such a distinction.Samsung tried to get a larger victory today, asking for a Judgment as a Matter of Law that Apple hasn’t proven its case, and that no reasonable jury could possibly side with Apple. Koh rejected Samsung’s request, meaning the case will, as expected, move forward to the next phase. Earlier on Monday, Apple’s expert witness on financial matters testified regarding the damages Apple is seeking, a number that recently grew from $2.5 billion to $2.88 billion.With Apple resting its case, Samsung was able to start its defense late this afternoon. Samsung's first witness was Benjamin Bederson, chief scientist and co-founder of a mobile company called Zumobi. Bederson is testifying on Samsung's behalf because he helped create a user interface for mobile touchscreen devices called LaunchTile, which was apparently used in conjunction with Microsoft's Pocket PC software and the HP iPAQ device starting in November 2004. Samsung believes LaunchTile should count as prior art, making some of Apple's patents invalid because the technology already existed, according to a Forbes liveblog of the trial. After Bederson, one of the people behind a 2001 touchscreen tabletop computer called DiamondTouch also testified on the prior art issue.We’ll hear much more about why Samsung doesn't think it infringed Apple’s patents as the week goes on. Judge Koh is reportedly aiming to move to closing arguments by Tuesday of next week before handing the case off to the jury.

Sometime around the middle of this decade no one is sure exactly when -- executives on the go will begin carrying pocket-sized digital communicating devices. And although nobody is exactly sure what features these personal information gizmos will have, what they will cost, what they will look like or what they will be called, hundreds of computer industry officials and investors at the Mobile '92 conference here last week agreed that the devices could become the foundation of the next great fortunes to be made in the personal computer business."We are writing Chapter 2 of the history of personal computers," said Nobuo Mii, vice president and general manager of the International Business Machines Corporation's entry systems division.How rich is this lode? At one end of the spectrum is John Sculley, the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., who says these personal communicators could be "the mother of all markets."At the other end is Andrew Grove, the chairman of the Intel Corporation, the huge chip maker based in Santa Clara, Calif. He says the idea of a wireless personal communicator in every pocket is "a pipe dream driven by greed."These devices are expected to combine the best features of personal computers, facsimile machines, computer networks, pagers, personal secretaries, appointment books, address books and even paperback books and pocket CD players -- all in a hand-held box operated by pen, or even voice commands.Stuck in traffic on a business trip, an executive carrying a personal communicator could send and receive electronic mail and facsimile messages from anywhere in the country. She could also call up a local map on a 3-inch by 5-inch screen, draw a line between her current position (confirmed by satellite positioning signals) and her intended destination, and the device would give her specific driving instructions (as well as real-time warnings about traffic jams or accidents). Certainly, these are just predictions for now, but they sure are fun to think about.Once in the meeting, the executive could take notes on the device, and even order pizza for the group using a combination of custom electronic forms and wireless fax. After updating her schedule electronically and sending notes back to her office computer network, she could check restaurant and movie information, including critics' reviews. Back at the hotel, she could plug in the latest disk-based novel.A number of demonstrations at the conference, some using real products and some relying on imagination, explored the potential of these machines."It's not boiling yet, but we're starting to see bubbles," said Alain Rossmann, president and chief executive of EO, a secretive new high-technology company in Foster City, Calif."But it ain't soup yet," responded one skeptic in the crowded room.Many of the technologies needed to create these personal communicators already exist. Participants at the conference bristled with tiny cellular phones, digital beepers, notebook computers, Sharp Wizards or other simple electronic data books, and the occasional old-fashioned paper pad.William J. Warwick, president of A.T.& T. Microelectronics, showed how he currently uses some of the technology that will be incorporated in tomorrow's personal digital assistants, and it was not a pretty sight. He started by emptying his overstuffed briefcase: a portable computer (with a fax modem), a backup battery, a battery charger, cellular telephone, a backup battery for the phone, another battery charger, some wires for connecting the modem to a telephone outlet, an external floppy disk drive, a digital pager, an AC power adapter, some power cords and the usual paper notebooks.

Although previous versions of Windows Mobile have long supported a clipboard to move content around, the Windows Phone 7 Series devices due out this year won't have that ability.LAS VEGAS--The new Windows Phones have a lot of things that prior versions of Windows Mobile haven't had, most notably a cool factor.But one thing that the 7 Series devices won't have--at least not this year's crop--is the ability to broadly copy and paste items. As earlier noted by Engadget, Microsoft confirmed on Tuesday that developers shouldn't expect to have access to a clipboard to allow users to copy and paste. Nor will Microsoft's own Office applications have copy and paste. That's despite the fact that it has been a staple of past versions of Windows Mobile for as long as I can recall."We don't enable copy and paste and we do that very intentionally," Windows Phone executive Todd Brix said in an interview.Brix said many times when a user copies something on a phone, what they really are looking to do is take a specific action, such as calling a phone number or e-mailing an address. For those specific tasks, Microsoft has what it calls "smart linking," which lets a user double click on a phone number and either call it or add it to the phone book. For an address, one can get a map without having to copy and paste the address."It's actually an intentional design decision," he said. "We try to anticipate what the user wants so copy and paste isn't necessary."But, particularly for a device that is going to include Word and other mobile Office applications, the concept of intelligent links doesn't seem sufficient. The BlackBerry for example, offers both intelligent links and a copy-and-paste system, which seems to me to be ideal.Brix insists that most users won't miss copy and paste and said that it was a matter of focus; Microsoft said it wanted to really do well the tasks that 80 percent of users wanted."We tried to focus on what the core use cases were," Brix said. "Certainly there will be some people that wont be happy with some of those decisions."If this feels like deja vu, a similar limitation hampered the initial iPhone, with Apple later going back and adding the feature.As my colleague Jessica Dolcourt noted recently, it's not like users don't want copy and paste. We just take it for granted unless some one boldy chooses to omit it.With the 7 Series taking so many cues from the iPhone, I'm surprised Microsoft didn't learn that lesson.

The redesigned Apple TV cost $64 to make and its internal design and key components are almost exactly the same as Apple's iPad, iPhone 4, and iPod Touch, a teardown analysis showed.The recently released, second-generation device for streaming video, music, and video over a Wi-Fi connection to a flat-panel TV is a dramatic departure from the previous product, which was built like a mini-computer, iSuppli said in releasing its report Tuesday. The current product has the same A4 processor core, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip, and power management chip that are the building blocks of the iPad tablet, iPhone 4 smartphone, and iPod Touch media player."The first Apple TV was built like a net-top computer. The architecture was basically a stripped down, small-form-factor desktop PC," said Andrew Rassweiler, teardown analyst for iSuppli, said in a statement. "The second generation Apple TV is more like an iPad or iPod Touch with no display."The new Apple TV carries a bill of materials of $61.98, based on a preliminary estimate by iSuppli. When manufacturing costs are added, the production cost rises to $63.95, which doesn't include research and development, software, licensing, and royalties.Where Apple sold the first-generation product at a price close to the underlying hardware costs, the latest product, which costs $99, has a significantly improved ratio of hardware cost to retail price. Nevertheless, for Apple, the margin is much less than that for other Apple products, iSuppli said.The most clever design element with the latest Apple TV is in the handheld remote control, which represents "more incredible mechanical engineering from Apple," Rassweiler said."The remote appears to be machined from a solid piece of aluminum," the analyst said. "Because of this, the electronics of the device must be slid in through small holes on the side, similar to putting a ship in a bottle. It's a clever and a detail-oriented piece of design that makes the remote very pricey and very unique to Apple."As in other recent Apple designs, Samsung Electronics is the marquee component supplier for the Apple TV. Samsung makes the Apple-designed A4 application processor and the chip that holds the device's system memory. Combined, the technology is the most expensive section of the device at a cost of $16.55 or nearly 27% of the bill of materials.The second most expensive subsystem is the 8 GB of NAND flash used mostly for storing media. Toshiba was the supplier of the $14 subsystem in the unit torn down by iSuppli.The server market is changing rapidly. In this report, we look into the technological advances driving the server market forward, as well as the server strategies of Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Oracle-Sun, Cisco, and other vendors.

Virtual Projection walkthrough: (a) Shaking the device to create a view. (b) Interacting with a non-projected view. (c-e) Creating a projection by aiming at the secondary display, long pressing, and releasing. (f) Synchronized interaction. (g) Projection frustum can be used for filtering or navigating. (h) Projections can be moved or deleted by aiming, long pressing, and dragging out of the display. Image credit: Dominikus Baur, et al. Proceedings of CHI 2012 (preprint) (PhysOrg.com) -- A collaborative team from the University of Calgary, University of Munich, and Columbia, have figured out a way to use a smartphone to project the phone’s display on to external displays nearby. The team thinks of its technology approach, Virtual Projection, as "borrowing available display space in the environment." Dominikus Baur, Sebastian Boring, and Steven Feiner are behind Virtual Projection. Feiner is Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University where he directs the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab. According to a formal description of their technique, Virtual Projection “is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale, and orient an item in a single gesture.” The phone user holds the phone up to the target computer screen, the phone camera captures and compares images from the screen to work out location -- the system relies on tracking where the phone is being pointed--and passes information back to the computer screen via WiFi to place the projection on the screen. Multiple users can place images on the same screen, when the users want the images to work together. Baur, currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Calgary, took to his blog this week to elaborate on what the team set out to accomplish: “When we started with Virtual Projection the initial idea was just to artificially replicate the workings of an optical projector." The team wanted to come up with an easy solution and took up the smartphone concept. “While Virtual Projection has the clear downside that it requires a suitable display and does not work on any regular surface, we can at least fix some of the downsides of its real-world mode," he said. "One of the first things was getting rid of distortion. When projectors are aimed towards a wall at an angle, keystone distortion can arise, warping the resulting image. Virtual projections can be freely adjusted when it comes to distortion and transformations of the resulting image.” Components used for the team’s no-cables prototype included regular, unmodified iPhones, a server that runs on a Windows-PC, and Wifi . Their official paper on this project, “Virtual Projection: Exploring Optical Projection as a Metaphor for Multi-Device Interactions,” is to appear at the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2012) that starts May 6 in Austin. CHI is an international conference on human-computer interaction. The team is upbeat that they are on to something which, sooner than later, could be a pervasive, everyday opportunity for communication. "Imagine having a VP server running on every display that you encounter in your daily life and being able to 'borrow' the display space for a while (e.g., to look something up on a map)," said Baur. "Give it a few more years (and a friendly industry consortium) and this could become reality.”Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2012-01-virtual-team-iphone-wall-video.html#jCp

(CNN) -- For years tech pundits have been searching for an "iPhone" killer -- a mythical new device that would dethrone Apple's mighty handset as the most admired or popular smartphone.It may be already here.For the first time, Samsung's Galaxy S III overtook Apple's iPhone 4S to become the world's best-selling smartphone model for the third quarter (July through September) of 2012, according to new research by Strategy Analytics.The Galaxy S III shipped 18 million units worldwide, compared with 16.2 million for the iPhone 4S. That's 11% of all smartphones shipped on the planet.Yes, this is the phone inthose mocking TV ads that show annoying fanboys and fangirls in a thinly disguised Apple store line, obsessing over their impending purchase while a happy Galaxy S III owner saves a place in line ... for his parents.Released in May, the Android-based Galaxy S III boasts a bigger touchscreen and longer battery life than the iPhone 4S, along with more megapixels in its camera and the ability to run on 4G cellular networks. Some tech sites have rated it the best smartphone on the market.But the Galaxy S III reign atop the sales rankings will likely be short-lived. As Strategy Analytics pointed out, iPhone 4S sales waned in the third quarter as consumers waited for the iPhone 5, which went on sale September 21.Apple sold 5 million iPhone 5s that first weekend and is expected to sell many millions more during this holiday shopping season.

Nokia's Lumia 920 packs the industry's best image stabilization -- there's no questioning that -- thanks to a camera module that pairs both sensor and lens-based optical IS. The iPhone 5 also offers a notable improvement over its Apple-made predecessor on the video front, but considering that its stabilization is of the digital variety, we wouldn't expect it to top Nokia's new flagship. We had an opportunity to test both smartphones in a head-to-head demo at Nokia's research and development facility in Tampere, Finland, about two hours north of the company's Espoo headquarters. In fact, we're told that this is the very first such comparison shoot in the world, considering that the iPhone made it to market just last week and the only opportunity to shoot with a Lumia 920 is currently in the European country where the device was born.As expected, the Nokia phone was able to capture far smoother video than what we snapped with the iPhone, with both devices secured side-by-side in a homemade foam holster. Unlike our handheld interview shoot earlier today, we pushed the limits a bit further this time, running through Nokia's parking lot and turning every which way as well. It's important to note that the Lumia 920 we used was a prototype, but its performance was still quite solid. You'll find the side-by-side video just past the break -- the Lumia 920 is on the left, with the iPhone clip on the right.Update: We also had an opportunity to test the Samsung Galaxy S III (just below) and the HTC One X (following) against the Lumia 920. Both smartphones lack OIS, so we weren't surprised to see poor stabilization performance. Check out the videos for the head-to-head.

Google intends to continue Motorola Mobility’s demands for 2.25-percent of Apple’s iPhone sales in royalties, the search giant has revealed, once its acquisition of the smartphone manufacturer goes through. Although Google’s letter to the IEE standards agency this week ostensibly called for fair patent licensing deals, it also reiterates commitment to maximum 2.25-percent per-unit royalty that Motorola was roundly criticized for, FOSS Patents spotted.“Following Google’s acquisition of MMI [Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.], Google will honor MMI’s existing commitments to license the acquired MMI Essential Patent Claims on RAND [reasonable terms and conditions demonstrable free of any unfair discrimination] terms, as required by IEEE rules and consistent with MMI’s longstanding practice. This letter is irrevocable. Google understand that, pursuant to IEEE rules, MMI is prepared to grant licenses for Essential Patent Claims with a maximum per-unit royalty of 2.25-percent of the net selling price for the relevant end product on a go-forward basis, subject to offsets for the value of any cross-licenses or other consideration received from the licensee” Allen Lo, Deputy General Counsel, GoogleApple has argued that Motorola’s fee demands are excessive, and that its rivals are not following FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) guidelines in a similar way to that which sparked an EC investigation into potential antitrust behavior by Samsung. The Cupertino company’s legal team has also sought disclosure from other smartphone manufacturers as to how much they’ve agreed to pay Motorola in licensing fees, though it’s possible Motorola could argue that the reciprocal licensing means the deals are non-comparable.Meanwhile, Google’s stance on potential injunctions is apparently unchanged from Motorola Mobility’s existing approach: that is, to apply for an injunction if licensees don’t agree to its royalty terms. If, it’s suggested, the 2.25-percent referred solely to the specific component the patented technology was applied in – for instance, a baseband 3G/UMTS radio chipset – then that might be reasonable, but Motorola is chasing 2.25-percent of the entire end-product, i.e. almost $15 on the unsubsidized price of each entry-level iPhone 4S.The decision as to whether Google is allowed to acquire Motorola Mobility is expected to be reached on February 13.

Free image-browsing app is intended to show what is possible on the mobile platform, but where is the Windows Mobile version?Is it possible some at Microsoft find the iPhone a more attractive platform than the software giant's own Windows Mobile?Engineers in the company's Live Labs have released the company's first application for Apple's popular smartphone--even before making it available on Microsoft's own mobile platform. Seadragon Mobile, which was added to Apple's App Store on Saturday, is a free image-browsing app that allows users to quickly "deep zoom" images while online and is intended to demonstrate what is possible with a mobile platform.Seadragon is the backbone for Microsoft's Photosynth, which allows users to take a grouping of photographs and stitch them together into a faux 3D environment.Other iPhone apps are reportedly in development in Redmond; Microsoft's Tellme unit was expected to release the company's first iPhone app in the form of a voice-activated search for a variety of phones, including iPhone and BlackBerry. A Microsoft representative told my colleague Ina Fried in September that a public version of that program would likely be released in a few months.So where's the Windows Mobile version of Seadragon?"The iPhone is the most widely distributed phone with a (graphics processing unit)," Alex Daley, group product manager for Microsoft Live Labs, told TechFlash. "Most phones out today don't have accelerated graphics in them. The iPhone does and so it enabled us to do something that has been previously difficult to do."

A security researcher has discovered that any wireless network can pretend to be an AT&T Wi-Fi hot spot and thus lure unsuspecting iPhone users to an untrusted network connection.Samy Kamkar, who created a worm that garnered him a million friends on MySpace overnight in 2005, said in an interview this week that he can hijack any iPhone within Wi-Fi range in what is often dubbed a "man-in-the-middle" attack because of the way the devices are configured to recognize AT&T Wi-Fi connections merely by the name "attwifi."Typically, an iPhone will look for a specific MAC address--the unique identifier for the router--to verify that the wireless network is a device a user agreed to join previously, according to Kamkar. However, if the iPhone has previously connected to any one of the numerous free AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots (offered at virtually every Starbucks in the U.S., for example) the device will ignore what the MAC address says and simply connect to the network if it has "AT&T Wifi" attached, he said."The iPhone joins the network by name with no other form of authentication," he said.Kamkar said he made this discovery recently when he was at a Starbucks and disconnected from the AT&T Wi-Fi network."I went into the settings to disconnect and the prompt was different from normal," he said. "I went home and had my computer pretend to be an AT&T hot spot just by the name and my iPhone continued to connect to it. I saw one or two other iPhones hop onto the network, too, going through my laptop computer. I could redirect them, steal credentials as they go to Web sites," among other stealth moves, if he had wanted to.To prove that a hijack is possible, Kamkar wrote a program that displays messages and can make other modifications when someone is attempting to use the Google Maps program on an iPhone that has been intercepted. He will be releasing his hijacking program via his Twitter account: http://twitter.com/samykamkar.Kamkar hasn't attempted the hijack on an iPod Touch, but plans to determine whether it has the same vulnerability.iPhone users can protect themselves by disabling their Wi-Fi, or they can turn off the automatic joining of the AT&T Wi-Fi network, but only if the device is within range of an existing AT&T hot spot, Kamkar said.Asked for comment an Apple spokeswoman said: "iPhone performs properly as a Wi-Fi device to automatically join known networks. Customers can also choose to select to 'Forget This Network' after using a hot spot so the iPhone doesn't join another network of the same name automatically."Kamkar, an independent researcher based in Los Angeles, first made a name for himself by launching what was called the "Samy" worm on MySpace in order to see how quickly he could get friends on the social-networking site. The cross-site scripting (XSS) worm displayed the words "Samy is my hero" on a victim's profile and when others viewed the page they were infected.He served three years of probation under a plea agreement reached in early 2007 for releasing the worm.

Ahead of a contract trial due to happen next week, Apple has declared that it’s willing to pay Motorola for a license to its wireless patents. It is, however, only prepared to stump up $1 per iPhone.FOSS Patents reports that Apple’s lawyers made the declaration, which covers essential wireless patents used for cellular and Wi-Fi standards, yesterday. From the court filing:“Apple’s actions in both licensing and litigation have matched its words in public. Because of that, Apple is willing to pay the FRAND [(fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory)] rate this Court sets going forward if that rate is less than or equal to $1 per unit for its worldwide sales of covered products… This is the rate that Apple believes is appropriate in these circumstances, a rate that flows from Apple’s articulated FRAND framework, and the only rate that can be supported by experts at this trial. To the extent the Court sets the rate higher than $1 per unit, Apple reserves the right to exhaust all appeals and also reserves the right available to any party offered a license: the right to refuse and proceed to further infringement litigation.”According to FOSS patents, Apple’s position is strong - especially given that Motorola’s one expert witness is no longer able to “testify about a particular rate at trial” because the court held that he “did not offer any opinion about what particular rate or range or rates would constitute a FRAND royalty”. Dang.Apple’s no-more-than-$1 position stands a fair chance of sticking then, which could prove a massive kick in the teeth to Moto. Let’s wait and see. [FOSS Patents]

Pre-orders for the iPhone 5 went live at midnight and, true to form, they went like hotcakes. You may remember that it took 22 hours for the iPhone 4S and about 20 hours for the iPhone 4 to sell out of its pre-order, launch-day stock.The iPhone 5 took just about 60 minutes. Yep. One hour after pre-orders went live, Apple.com adjusted shipping expectations from one to two weeks due to the overwhelming demand.Demand for the phone caused problems on Apple’s website and several of the wireless carriers’ sites, as many users were met with error messages when they attempted to pre-order the new iPhone. There’s always plenty of hubbub around Apple product launches, though the pre-order launch of the iPhone 4S came and went without problems on Apple.com or carrier sites. It wouldn’t be surprising if this turns out to be an indication of what’s to come.All summer we were subjected to seemingly endless speculation and rumors regarding every last detail of the new, new iPhone. But, when it was finally unveiled this week, the reviews — which, while still characterized by the usual fanboi excitement — seemed more lukewarm than in years past. Even compared to the recent iPad/Mac event.As is so often the case with Apple, the new phone looks great, with the bigger screen and improved speed ranking as my personal favorites. Yet, that being said, I haven’t yet seen the kind of mind-melting innovation and improvement that would justify pre-orders 20 times faster than the 4 and 4S.Nonetheless, people are still ready to buy it in what will no doubt be massive numbers.“Available to ship: 2 weeks”… man that last week it’s gonna feel like you have an old cement block in your pocket.I guess I shouldn’t be surprised anymore that Apple product launches somehow continue to exceed expectations, the machine reliably churning out another hit. But I am. Mostly because of how rampant the obsession is to buy the next generation of iPhone as soon as possible.MG Siegler wrote yesterday about the way Apple showcases these events, discussing the turn and the prestige. But a couple of sentences really jumped out at me beyond the presentation of the phone.That’s what really matters. The bottom line sits atop everything else. And the bottom line is that, despite the phone not having any of those drastic changes some hoped for (NFC?) and a lack of an overwhelming “wow” factor, so many people went online at midnight or past — on a work night no less — to shell out hundreds of dollars for a pre-order jubilee that had sites crashing and the first batch selling out in 60 minutes.That’s why Apple is the most valuable company in the world.The question is: The iPhone 4S had Siri, which captured our attention in full, even if she’s been a disappointment since … so what feature or tool will be that for the 5?Update: The ship time on Apple’s site is now 2-3 weeks:And Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told AllThingsD: “Pre-orders for iPhone 5 have been incredible. We’ve been completely blown away by the customer response.”

GOOG +0.26%  , have so far failed to distinguish themselves from a growing field of competitors."From our conversations with supply chain and industry sources, it appears that it ultimately came down to lack of carrier interest," Wu wrote.Rumors of a branded Dell mobile phone have been swirling since January, when speculation surfaced that the company might unveil a device at a high-profile event such as last month's Mobile World Congress. See related story on Dell phone reports.But Wu wrote that the potentially small subsidies from carriers operating cellular networks to help sell Dell's devices meant it would be difficult for the Round Rock, Tex.-based PC giant to make a profit.A representative for Dell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has never confirmed that it is working on a mobile device.A smartphone from Dell would face a slew of tough competitors, including the BlackBerry from Research In Motion RIMM +1.20%  and the iPhone from Apple Inc. AAPL -0.85%  . Wu noted that another potential rival is the up-coming Pre smartphone from Palm Inc. , which is expected to launch by June 30. See story on investor enthusiasm about the Pre."Palm Pre has not helped" Dell's efforts, Wu wrote, as it has generated "interest from carriers as a viable competitor."Wu wrote that Dell has not abandoned its effort to release a mobile device, though it has "gone back to the drawing board" to design a more distinct model, which may involve making related acquisitions.Dell would not be unique as a PC maker expanding into the market for so-called smart phones. The most famous example is Apple Inc. AAPL -0.85%  , which has shaken up the industry with its wildly popular iPhone. Another is Taiwan-based Acer Inc., which unveiled a line of new mobile devices at the Mobile World Congress event last month.  See story on Acer's phone announcement.

Private information stored in Apple's iPhone and protected by a lock code can be accessed by anyone with just a few button presses.The iPhone, like most mobile phones, can be locked with a four-digit code, but where other phones in their locked state only permit calls to emergency service numbers such as 911 (in the U.S.), 999 (in the U.K.) and 112 (throughout Europe), a locked iPhone can be used to make a call to any number.[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes' Security Adviser blog and newsletter, both from InfoWorld. ]However, that's not all you can do with a locked iPhone running the latest version of Apple's software, 2.0.2.Pressing the emergency call button at the unlock screen, followed by two taps on the home button, takes you to the iPhone's private 'favorites' page without the need to enter the unlock code. If the owner of the phone has favorite entries in their address book containing URLs, e-mail addresses or mobile phone numbers, then those entries can be used to launch the browser, mail application or SMS (Short Message Service) software, and gain access to private Web favorites, e-mail messages, and text messages stored in the phone, again without entering the unlock code.The security flaw, revealed by a member of the MacRumors.com forum, came as a surprise to an Apple spokeswoman in London, who said she would look into the matter.One way to avoid such unauthorized access to e-mail messages or Web favorites would be not to add e-mail addresses or URLs to favorite address book entries.Apple pushed version 2.0 of its iPhone software as being more enterprise-friendly: some businesses had been reluctant to adopt the first version of the iPhone because it did not adequately protect corporate information stored in the device.

Porissa sattui maanantaina aamulla jotain varsin kummallista matkapuhelimen kanssa. Nuori mies sai epämukavan kuuman herätyksen maanantaihin. - Aamusta heräilin ja piti mennä yhdeksäksi töihin, mutta meninkin kahdeksaksi isäni kyydillä, aloittaa Helminen. Perillä työpaikan pihalla nuori mies laittoi autossa iPhonen takataskuunsa ja nousi autosta ulos maanantaisesta aamuherätyksestä vielä hieman väsyneenä. Pian kuitenkin takataskussa alkoi tapahtua kummia. - Kävelin autosta ulos kaksi metriä, kun alkoi kuulua outoa suhinaa. Kohta paikat kuumenivat. - Ihmettelin sitä suhinaa ja yhtäkkiä rupesi polttamaan. Katsoin taaksepäin ja savua tuli aivan järkyttävästi. En yhtään osannut ajatella, että se olisi puhelin! Lopulta nuori mies nappaa kännykän takataskusta ja heittää maahan. - Puhelin oli ihan liekeissä ja savusi oikein kunnolla. Housutkin olivat vähän liekeissä. Kyllä siinä kädet tärisivät! Pian isä Juho Helminenkin huomasi, että jotain kummaa tapahtui. Koko tapahtumaketjun tallensi firman valvontakamera. - Siinä se ihan selkeästi näkyy, että poika kävelee autosta vähän maanantaiaamun tyyliin, ja yhtäkkiä savua tulee aivan kamalasti, isä sanoo. - Housuihin paloi kiinni sulaa muovia ja kännykkä paloi huonoon kuntoon, poika kertoo. - Jos olisin mennyt yhdeksäksi, kuten aluksi pitikin, niin kännykkähän olisi syttynyt kotona. Siinä olisi sänky syttynyt palamaan ja olisi voinut käydä pahemminkin. Pidän puhelinta aina sängyssä ja olen tässä miettinyt, mitä kaikkea olisi voinut tapahtua. Isä on ollut yhteydessä Appleen. - Ensin yhdistettiin Yhdysvaltoihin, sitten Ruotsiin ja sitten jollekin suomea puhuvalle, katsotaan nyt miten tämä tästä. Nuori on nyt ilman puhelinta ja uusi pitäisi hankkia. iPhone ei ole joutunut mustalle listalle. - Tässä on nyt selvittelyä, että mitä Apple ja vakuutus tähän sanoo. Eiköjän tässä nyt kuitenkin ole jonkinlaisesta yksittäistapauksesta kyse, poika sanoo. iPhone on ostettu maaliskuun 22. päivä ja se toimi ennen tätä moitteettomasti.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — A federal judge says a monopoly abuse lawsuit against Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc.'s mobile phone unit can move forward as a class action.The lawsuit consolidates several filed by iPhone buyers starting in late 2007, a few months after the first generation of Apple's smart phone went on sale.An amended complaint filed in June 2008 takes issue with Apple's practice of "locking" iPhones so they can only be used on AT&T's network, and its absolute control over what applications iPhone owners can and cannot install on the gadgets.The lawsuit also says Apple secretly made AT&T its exclusive iPhone partner in the U.S. for five years. Consumers agreed to two-year contracts with the Dallas-based wireless carrier when they purchased their phones, but were in effect locked into a five-year relationship with AT&T, the lawsuit argued.The actions hurt competition and drove up prices for consumers, the lawsuit claims.Apple and AT&T have not commented on the terms of their deal. In its response to the complaint, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it did not hurt competition.In court documents filed July 8, Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said parts of the lawsuit that deal with violations to antitrust law can continue as a class action. The class includes anyone who bought an iPhone with a two-year AT&T agreement since the device first went on sale in June 2007.Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones in the last three years. The company does not specify how many have gone to U.S. customers.Ware dismissed other claims against Apple, among them allegations that the company broke laws when an update to the iPhone's operating software caused some phones to stop working and deleted programs that users had purchased.The lawsuit seeks an injunction to keep Apple from selling locked iPhones in the U.S. and from determining what iPhone programs people can install. It also seeks damages to cover legal fees and other costs.

The launch of Apple’s latest smartphone has come and gone, sending millions of users home with the latest in mobile tech from Apple. Everything about the iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, and smaller, right down to the SIM card.For the second time since the original iPhone, Apple has opted for a smaller SIM to go in their phone. Micro-SIM cards are now the standard for many carriers, just in time for Apple to adopt the smaller nano-SIM for their devices. This means that every iPhone 5 user, even the ones that are moving from the iPhone 4S, need to move to a new SIM card and throw their old ones away. On an individual scale this is no big deal, but what does such a small change mean on a global scale?Within the first day of pre-orders, Apple had sold more than two million iPhone 5 handsets. This doesn’t include any of the hordes of people that waited outside of an Apple Store on the release day for the phone (which took that figure up to 5 million). This launch was the biggest one Apple has ever had, and the largest pre-order event any smartphone has ever had. More than five million people, most of whom already had a smartphone, now need a new SIM card.Despite the nano-SIM being much smaller than previous cards, the plastic tray that every user is given is the exact same size. This credit card sized piece of plastic has a small rectangle notched out where you punch through and pop out your nano-SIM. The previous SIM and the plastic holder for the new SIM are then tossed in the garbage.The previous SIM and the casing to the new SIM together will weigh about 5.6 grams. If you look at the five million users that managed to secure an iPhone 5 already, that is roughly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated just by forcing every user to replace their SIM card. Nearly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated in a single weekend, and the knowledge that if any of those users move away from the iPhone 5 to another device any time soon, that user will need to change SIM cards all over again.Apple maintains a page on their own website that describes all of the environmental practices, including the things they have done to improve their packaging and manufacturing process along the way. That page has not yet been updated to the iPhone 5, and so does not include any information on what Apple feels the footprint of their latest smartphone is.If you are someone who has just picked up the iPhone 5 and changed SIM, please recyle the plastic.

Responding to a string of complaints, Apple said that the error overstated the phone's signal strength, causing it to appear to lose more reception than it actually does when gripped a certain way.Angry owners said that when they grip it via its lower left-hand corner, the phone drops several bars of signal."We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising," the company wrote in a letter."Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength."Apple's CEO Steve Jobs last week told people complaining about the issue to simply hold their phone a different way.Earlier this week, the company stated that "gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas".It now says the combination of the effect of gripping the phone, plus the error in the way signal is displayed on the iPhone 4, is what is causing some users to report a drop of several bars."Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars."Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place," Apple said Friday.The company said that it wouldl issue a software update within a few weeks to fix the issue, adding: "We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same - the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped."Several users have filed lawsuits over the reception issue.

An Apple logo is seen at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California June 11, 2012.The ruling came from Judge Richard Posner in Chicago federal court. He dismissed the litigation between Apple and Motorola Mobility with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled.The ruling is a blow for Apple, which had hoped a decisive ruling against Motorola would help it gain an upper hand in the smartphone market against Android."Apple is complaining that Motorola's phones as a whole ripped off the iPhone as a whole," Posner wrote. "But Motorola's desire to sell products that compete with the iPhone is a separate harm -— and a perfectly legal one -— from any harm caused by patent infringement."Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment on the ruling. Motorola Mobility spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said the company was pleased that Posner dismissed Apple's case.Both parties have the option to appeal Posner's ruling.Motorola sued Apple in October 2010, a move that was widely seen as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent Apple lawsuit. Apple filed its own claims against Motorola the same month.Posner issued a series of pre-trial rulings that eliminated nearly all of Motorola's patent claims against Apple from the prospective trial, while maintaining more of Apple's claims against Motorola. That meant Apple had more to gain in the trial, which had been set to start last week.However, Posner canceled the trial earlier this month.Apple had sought an injunction barring the sale of Motorola products using Apple's patented technology. But in Friday's ruling, Posner wrote that neither party is entitled to an injunction.Since Motorola could design around the minor technological features covered by Apple's patents, an injunction would be an inappropriate windfall for Apple, Posner wrote.Posner also said that Apple had not clearly demonstrated that Motorola phones caused a loss of consumer goodwill significant enough for an injunction."To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture," Posner wrote.In a bright spot for the iPhone maker, Posner also ruled that Motorola could not seek an injunction based on the one patent in the case that it was still asserting against Apple.Motorola had pledged to license that patent - which covers an aspect of wireless communication - on fair and reasonable terms to other companies in exchange for having the technology adopted as an industry standard."How could it be permitted to enjoin Apple from using an invention that it contends Apple must use if it wants to make a cell phone," Posner wrote.At a hearing earlier this week, Apple had argued that it would be satisfied with an injunction forcing Motorola to remove Apple's patented features within three months. But Posner found that proposal unworkable, in part because of the hardship in administering such an order."Because of the potential costs to Motorola and the federal judiciary I could not responsibly order injunctive relief in favor of Apple," he wrote in his ruling.The case is Apple Inc. and NeXT Software Inc. V. Motorola Inc. and Motorola Mobility Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, no. 11-08540.(Reporting by Dan Levine in Oakland, California and Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and Jeremy Laurence)

Microsoft and Apple are said to be discussing a deal that would see Microsoft Bing become the default search engine on Apple's iPhone.The move, according to a published report, would result in the ouster of Google as the main search portal on the iPhone.Apple may be looking to ditch Google from its devices in response to Google's launch of an iPhone competitor, dubbed Nexus One, earlier this month, according to BusinessWeek. The story said Microsoft might also be looking to make Bing the default search tool on Apple's Safari Web browser.Like the iPhone, the Nexus One features downloadable apps and an interactive touch screen. But unlike Apple, Google plans to sell an open version of the $529 phone that's not linked to a specific carrier."Apple and Google know the other is their primary enemy," said an anonymous source quoted by BusinessWeek in a story published Wednesday. The magazine said the source had knowledge of Apple's plans.It was not immediately clear how much traffic the iPhone generates for Google, but the number could be significant as the iPhone dominates the North American mobile device market.Microsoft and Apple officials didn't comment for the story.If such a deal plays out, it could provide a marked boost for Microsoft's search business. Bing captured just 10.7% of all U.S. search traffic in December, according to market watcher Comscore, while Google, the number one player, took 65.7% of all traffic. Second place Yahoo grabbed 17.3%.Microsoft already has a deal in place to add Bing to Yahoo's Web pages.Microsoft shares were off 2.03%, to $30.47, in morning trading Wednesday. Apple was down 1.65%, to $211.49, while Google was off by 1.41%, to $579.35, as the markets opened lower on concerns about bank earnings.Still shackling your workers to a standard company PC?

AT&T Mobility put some asterisks on its iPhone 3G pricing Tuesday but also revealed an interesting option coming in the future: an iPhone without a contract.In the news release disclosing terms and monthly rates for iPhone 3G service plans, the carrier hinted at the upcoming offer without saying anything about when it will become available. Freedom will come with a price -- $599 for an 8GB device and $699 for a 16GB -- but this will mark the first time consumers in the United States are able to buy an iPhone without being tied down to a two-year contract.[ For the big picture on the iPhone 3G, see InfoWorld's special report ]The phone probably would still be locked for use only on AT&T's network, said Jupiter Research analyst Michael Gartenberg. But buyers could choose a pay-as-you-go plan for voice service -- there is no prepaid data plan from AT&T -- or just use the device as a media player and calendar and access the Web via its Wi-Fi radio. Unlike the slimmer iPod Touch, the iPhone has a camera and a small speaker. The numerous third-party applications coming to the iPhone later this month presumably also could be used without a service plan.However, the no-contract phone is likely to have a narrow appeal, he said."That's a pretty hefty premium you're going to pay over an iPod Touch," Gartenberg said.The iPhone 3G is set to go on sale July 11. On Tuesday, AT&T revealed details of the four plans it will offer for the iPhone 3G. They range from $69.99 per month for 450 anytime minutes and 5,000 night and weekend minutes, to $129.99 per month for unlimited anytime minutes. All the plans include unlimited data but not an SMS (Short Message Service) package. Taxes are extra. There are more details at AT&T's iPhone page.Also on Tuesday, AT&T said the iPhone 3G's vaunted $199 price would only be available to three kinds of customers:-- people who bought the iPhone before July 11-- customers new to AT&T, or ones activating a totally new line-- existing AT&T customers who are eligible for an upgrade discountThis means current AT&T customers with handsets other than the iPhone will have to pay $399 for an 8GB iPhone 3G or $499 for the 16GB model unless they are due for a phone upgrade discount.Any AT&T customer upgrading to the iPhone 3G will be charged an upgrade fee of $18 instead of the standard $36 activation fee that newcomers to AT&T will pay. Those who bought a 2G iPhone on or after May 27 will be able to swap it for a 3G model and pay only a restocking fee. However, anyone upgrading from a 2G iPhone to the new model will have to enter into a new two-year contract under a 3G iPhone plan.Used 2G iPhones can be handed down to family or friends, but their new owners will have to take the handsets to an AT&T store for activation before using them as phones, according to AT&T.Despite the debuts of alternatives such as the Samsung Instinct from Sprint Nextel, there's still no real competition, Gartenberg said. The iPhone's iPod features and direct connection to iTunes, plus its software overall, make it stand out."None of them are quite delivering on the same experience that Apple is, just yet," Gartenberg said.

Though the iPhone 4S has set sales records and been met with hugely positive reviews, owners have been reporting a big problem with their new Apple smartphone: battery life.Could Apple be on the verge of Battery-Gate? A story in the Guardian reported that Apple engineers have begun contacting certain users who have complained about battery problems; apparently, Apple has asked those users to install diagnostic programs onto their phones so that Apple can better diagnose what is causing the battery problems. We've reached out to Apple for comment on that front and will update when we hear back.Almost since the release of the iPhone 4S, the Internet has been absolutely lit up with stories about the failings of its battery life. iLounge's mammoth review of the iPhone 4S noted that the biggest disappointment about the phone is its battery performance.Erick Schonfeld, editor of our sister site TechCrunch, recently penned an opinion piece/plea-to-corporate-giant entitled "Dear Apple, Please Make My iPhone 4S Battery Life Suck Less," in which he describes his iPhone dying within eight hours of a full charge. His claims that the iPhone 4S battery lasted for about two-and-a-half hours of Internet usage, 30 minutes of talk time and five hours on standby before being drained, echoed similar claims on the Apple support forums, which are flooded with complaints and pleas for help. MacWorld also published a long first-person essay in which one writer investigates his problems with the iPhone 4S's battery and attempts to get to the root of the problem.Looking for ways to improve your own iPhone 4S's battery life? Several tech sites around the web have published stories about just that. Apple blog TiPb and HuffPost tech sister site TUAW, for example, offered several tips for improving performance, including lowering your screen brightness and locking your display whenever you aren't using it. Gizmodo also listed several possible culprits that could be draining the iPhone battery (most likely: iCloud, Location Services, the Notification Center). GottaBeMobile and The Atlantic Wire both offered extensive battery life tips as well.In its story, the Guardian notes that Apple is forthright about the lackluster battery life of its newest iPhone: Its technical specs show that the iPhone 4S gets even worse standby battery life than the original iPhone. The first-generation model got 250 hours of standby time, compared with 200 for the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 4 got 300 hours of standby time.Though Apple's website has a handy list of tips for those wanting to improve their phone's battery life, the complaints have not stopped pouring in; if the Guardian's story is true, then Apple may have its first bonafide PR problem on its hands. Last year's Antenna-Gate scandal is surely fresh: The fiasco surrounding the "death grip" that caused the iPhone 4 to lose cellular reception was much publicized, but apparently did not cause Apple to lose any fans or mobile consumers. Given initial sales numbers for the iPhone 4S, Antenna-Gate was but a minor blip on the radar.This, too, is probably the fate for the iPhone 4S battery life saga: an annoyance, not a disqualifier. For now, iPhone 4S owners will just have to learn to keep a charger more handy than they're accustomed to doing.

Google has denied the latest rumors that the search giant will bring free turn-by-turn GPS navigation on the Apple iPhone, although the features could come in the future to other (unspecified) mobile platforms.Reports surfaced on Thursday quoting a Google executive speaking about plans to bring free turn-by-turn navigation to other mobile platforms, including the iPhone, during a London press conference launching Maps Navigation for Android phones in the U.K.."We did not say we would bring it to iPhone, we said to date we've had it on Android and that in the future it may come to other platforms but did not confIn Android 2.0, Google introduced Maps Navigation, which includes 3D maps, turn-by-turn voice guidance, and automatic rerouting -- all at no cost for the user. Available initially only in the U.S., the software does not store the maps on your phone, but uses the Internet connection to display routes.However, Google clarified on Thursday a few unknowns about its free navigation software for Android. Maps Navigation pre-caches an entire route, and it needs a data connection only when it calculates the directions. So, while driving to your destination, if you lose the connection temporarily, the route progress will still be displayed as long as you stay on the initial route.Free turn-by-turn navigation for mobile phones is getting increasingly popular with customers, to the detriment of traditional GPS device makerslike TomTomor Garmin. Next to Google's Maps Navigation, now available in both U.S. and U.K., Nokia introduced in January its own free GPS software for several of its devices, and by now has been downloaded more than 10 million times.

One of the world’s largest oilfield companies, Halliburton, publicly acknowledged its decision to stop giving workers BlackBerrys and start equipping them with iPhones. This is a gigantic blow to Research in Motion because the BlackBerry has for a very long time been widely considered the best phone for enterprise users. Halliburton obviously disagrees and so will many other companies if RIM doesn’t step its game up in time.Spokesperson for Halliburton, Tara Mullee Agard, said to Reuters in an email, “We are making this transition in order to better support our mobile applications initiatives.” The transition she speaks of is the movement from BlackBerry to iPhone over the next two years for 4,500 employees. She also pointed out Apple is helping the company with the process.Apple didn’t just steal a large amount of candy from RIM, it’s getting the dirty pleasure of chewing slowly right in front of RIM.BlackBerry advocates, you are now presented with a challenge: come up with a better excuse than “BlackBerry devices are for business users.” I’m afraid that argument is no longer valid. Oh, and since BlackBerry isn’t so hot with consumers either, what exactly is the target market? Please hurry. The BlackBerry Bold Team is waiting for its next mission.George has followed technology news for quite some time, but he only started writing about it a few years ago.

Oh, you knew this was going to happen. Samsung is not taking the release of the iPhone 5 lying down. A new ad declares Apple's phone isn't genius.I don't think they've kissed and made up yet.When one party embarrasses another so badly -- and in public -- you don't expect the hurt one to just take it, do you?And so Samsung is greeting the arrival of the iPhone 5 with an ad that will run tomorrow in certain national and local newspapers (how modern). It is not a flattering ad. It suggests that the iPhone 5 isn't even good enough to be, well, a copy of the Galaxy S3.Clearly, it's been hastily put together, but its headline -- "It doesn't take a genius" -- rather prepares you for what follows.Yes, it's a list of all the fine, rational reasons why the Galaxy S3 is vintage port compared to the iPhone 5's wine-in-a-box.Oh, the Galaxy S3 is full of things the iPhone doesn't have: Palm Swipe Capture, Shake to Update, oh, and NFC -- to name but three.And though there's no doubt that the S3 is a fine phone -- especially for those with hands handed down by gorillas -- there is one small element that Samsung might be overlooking.People don't buy the iPhone for all the features. They buy it for all those quirky, irrational, emotional, maddening reasons that make people's eyes glaze over and their minds work like a blancmange clock.Samsung's biggest problem isn't that its phone doesn't have some fine rational attributes. It's that the brand hasn't captured hearts.There are no lists nor self-help books that can tell you how to do that. That does, sometimes, take a little genius.

Android has officially hit the big time now that sales of its devices exceeded the Apple iPhoneover the past quarter.Briefly, a look at the numbers: Over the span of a mere quarter last year, Android saw its share of the U.S. smartphone market more than double, as the platform was used on more than 7% of all U.S. smartphones at the end of 2009. The most recent research released by the NPD Group showed that Android-based phonesin the first quarter of 2010 accounted for 28% of all smartphone shipments, trailing only Research in Motion's BlackBerry operating system, which accounted for 36% of all smartphone shipments in the quarter. And finally, Android-based phones are now available on all four major U.S. wireless carriers, with the million-selling Motorola Droid so far serving as the platform's flagship device.So how did this all come together so quickly? Looking back over the past three years, it seems that Google had a very simple but effective plan to push its way into a crowded market. Using a combination of free software, design simplicity and brand clout, Google has succeeded in making an operating system that, in just a couple of years, has grown to rival the most popular mobile platforms in the business. Let's take a look at each element piece by piece:* First, make it free. One of the most enticing aspects of Android from both a software developer and a device manufacturer perspective is that it's completely free to use, as Google charges no licensing fees for anyone who wants to base their device or application on Android. This is a distinctly different path than the ones taken by Apple and Research in Motion, which both only allow use of their operating systems on their own devices, and by Microsoft, which only allows devices to use Windows Mobile through a licensing agreement.* Second, keep it simple. When Google went about attracting application developers to its new platform, it made a big deal about the Android software development kit's ease of use. And since Android is Linux platform that uses Java as its programming language, most software developers on the market haven't had much difficulty in writing programs for the operating system.Google has also gone out of its way to make posting a new application on the Android Market a snap, as the company does not screen any applications sent to the store and will only remove applications if it has received legitimate customer complaints about them."We created an account, uploaded our apps and then hit submit," said Ilya Eliashevsky, the product manager for app developer DataViz's Android product line, last year. "Then the app just started showing up on devices and we saw sales immediately starting to roll in."* Finally, be Google. There have been ambitious platform developers in the past who have tried to mainstream open source in the mobile OS market, but none of them so far have had the market clout of Google. Google's brand recognition not only helps it attract media attention to its initiatives but also helps it more quickly develop relationships with device manufacturers, carriers and app developers. In other words, while you obviously need to develop a strong mobile platform that device manufacturers, software developers and consumers want to use, it doesn't hurt to be the world's No.1 search engine either.Read more about anti-malware in Network World's Anti-Malware section.

Nine people went on trial in southern China over allegations they helped a teenager to sell one of his kidneys so he could buy an iPhone and an iPad, a court in Hunan Province said Friday.Prosecutors said in court Thursday that the nine people "should be held criminally liable for intentional injury," the court in the province's Beihu District said in a statement Friday.The 17-year-old high school student from Anhui Province -- who was referred to only by his surname, Wang -- suffered renal failure after the kidney was removed in April 2011, according Xinhua.The defendants included a man named He Wei, who was described by the authorities as "penniless and frustrated over gambling debts."He was "seeking financial gain via the illegal kidney trade" and recruited others to help him look for donors in Internet chat rooms and set up the operation, the prosecutors said.A surgeon from a provincial hospital in Yunnan Province, Song Zhongyu, carried out the removal of Wang's kidney and transplanted it into the recipient, according to prosecutors.The proceeds from the sale of the kidney were shared unevenly among those involved, according to the Xinhua report.Another defendant, Su Kaizong, the contractor of the urology department of the hospital where the operation took place, received 60,000 yuan (about $9,400); He's cut was 56,360 yuan; Song got 52,000 yuan; and two other defendants received smaller amounts.For the loss of his kidney, Wang allegedly received 22,000 yuan. After he got home, his mother asked him where he had got the money for the Apple products. At that point, he told her had sold his kidney, Xinhua reported.His attorney requested compensation of 2.27 million yuan on Thursday, the news agency said.The police detained Song, He, Su and two others in July 2011 and later put the four other defendants -- two nurses, a surgical assistant and an anesthesiologist -- under residential surveillance, the court statement said.The hearing ended Friday, the court said, and the verdict will be announced at a later date.The likelihood of the defendants' being found guilty is high: Chinese criminal courts convicted 99.9% of the people who stood trial in 2010, a U.S. State Department report said, citing the Chinese Supreme People's Court.Is technology making us crazy?How 'smart' devices affect us

What critics were saying about Steve Jobs' smartphone in the months before it launched. Three years ago, when it became clear that Apple (AAPL) was about to unveil some kind of mobile phone, critics began to weigh in on its chances of success. AAPLinvestors' Terry Gregory, building on a list of skeptical quotes begun by MacDailyNews, has put together what may be the definitive collection.A sample:"We've learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone. PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They're not going to just walk in.""Apple is slated to come out with a new phoneâ€¦ And it will largely fail.""The only question remaining is if, when the iPod phone fails, it will take the iPod with it.""Apple will likely have a tough time convincing application vendors to build specialized clients for the iPhone until the volumes are there, and the volumes could be limited by the lack of third-party applications â€“ a Catch 22.""The iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks.""Five hundred dollars? Fully subsidized, with a plan? It is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email machineâ€¦ So, I, I kinda look at that and I say, well, I like our strategy. I like it a lot."I am not sure how it will stand against Sprint's Wimax (when it successfully launches) and its phones, which I am looking forward much more than over-hyped Apple iPhone.""iPhone may well become Apple's next Newton.""Apple should pull the plug on the iPhoneâ€¦ What Apple risks here is its reputation as a hot company that can do no wrong. If it's smart it will call the iPhone a 'reference design' and pass it to some suckers to build with someone else's marketing budget. Then it can wash its hands of any marketplace failuresâ€¦ Otherwise I'd advise people to cover their eyes. You are not going to like what you'll see.""There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get.""How do they deal with us?""Apple begins selling its revolutionary iPhone this summer and it will mark the end of the string of hits for the company.""What does the iPhone offer that other cell phones do not already offer, or will offer soon? The answer is not very muchâ€¦ Apple's stated goal of selling 10 million iPhones by the end of 2008 seems ambitious.""We Predict the iPhone will bomb. Which means that when the iPhone comes, Digg will likely be full of horror stories from the poor saps who camped out at their local AT&T store, only to find their purchase was buggier than a camp cabin.""The forthcoming (June 29) release of the Apple iPhone is going to be a bigger marketing flop than Ishtar and Waterworld combined. Because its designers forgot Platt's First, Last, and Only Law of User Experience Design ("Know Thy User, for He Is Not Thee"), that product is going to crash in flames. Sell your Apple stock now, while the hype's still hot. You heard it here first.""God himself could not design a device that could live up to all the hype that the iPhone has gotten."More than 33 million iPhones, 100,000 apps and 2 billion downloads later, the death watch continues.

One advantage of storing information online is being able to access it from anywhere, on any device. Last year we released a tool for Blackberry devices to sync Google Calendar and Gmail contacts with the pre-installed calendar and contacts applications. Today, we're offering more people easy access to their information on the go with two-way calendar and contacts sync for iPhones and Windows Mobile devices, and two-way contacts sync for mobile devices that support SyncML. This will be a particularly handy improvement for people who regularly use Google tools, like corporate employees, university students, and busy families. For iPhone and Windows Mobile devices, Google Sync allows you to get your Gmail contacts and Google Calendar events onto your phone. Sync uses push technology, which means that any changes you make to your calendar or contacts from the browser or phone will be reflected on your device within minutes. For phones that support SyncML, the tool will allow you to get your Gmail contacts onto your phone. For all of these devices, synchronization happens automatically over the air, without having to manually sync your phone. The connection is always on, which means your information is always up-to-date, no matter where you are or what you're doing.Getting started is easy. You can configure Google Sync directly from your device. The instructions and capabilities vary for different phones, so check out our Help Center for device-specific information. If you're a Google Apps user, Google Sync must be enabled for your domain by your administrator.Following our credo to launch early and iterate, we're introducing Google Sync in beta. Before you begin, we encourage you to review a few known issues for the iPhone and Windows Mobile devices. Also, please keep in mind that Google Sync will replace all existing contacts and calendar information on your phone, so make sure to back up any important data before you get started. You can find out more information on backing up your data in the Help Center. To try Sync, visit m.google.com/sync, and check out our video tour below.

A new lawsuit alleges AT&T is regularly overcharging iPhone and iPad customers for data usage, in some cases up to 300% more.[ad#Google Adsense 300x250 in story]Lawyers for the lawsuit said they spent $80,000 testing devices in preparation for their day in court. In one instance, lawyers purchased a brand new iPhone and turned off everything that could affect data usage. When the bill came in from AT&T, there were 35 transactions for data usage, according to MSNBC.Lawyers said that AT&T overcharged on every single transaction. Not once did a data usage charge go in favor of the customer. Lawyers said that AT&T systematically overstated data usage by 7-14% and sometimes up to 300%.While they said that individual charges may add up to $10 or $15 a month, with millions of customers, it’s quite a boon for AT&T.One lawyer compared the AT&T charges to a rigged gas pump where you pay for a gallon of gas and only get 9/10 of a gallon.AT&T says the charges are “without merit” and says customers misunderstand how data is charged. The company points to things like automatic app updates in the background that customers may not be aware of.

Dutch security researchers hacked an iPhone 4S on Wednesday, showing how a malicious webpage can send all pictures, address book data and browsing history on the phone to a server of the attacker's choice.Related ArticlesApple patches Pwn2Own, Comodo hack bugsBlack Hat roundup: Let the electric-shock craziness beginAll eyes on Apple with it set to take security publicIf You Use It, Mobile Malware Will ComeUntethered jailbreak for iOS 5.1.1 available for downloadAs participants in the Mobile Pwn2Own competition they demonstrated the exploit to an audience at the EUSecWest security conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday.Their attack works on iOS 5.1.1 and the developer release of iOS 6, and probably also works on the iPhone 5, said Joost Pol and Daan Keuper of Dutch security company Certified Secure. It also works on iPads, they said.The WebKit browser exploit was made in "only a few weeks," the researchers said. "And we didn't even work full time," said Keuper, who added that their exploit shows that limited time is needed to come up with a technique to exploit a security vulnerability in iOS.When a user visits a website where the code is running; the security mechanisms in Safari are circumvented, Pol explained. "We could embed the code in advertisements on news sites for example," said Pol, adding that if they can embed the code anywhere on a website, it will work.The researchers wouldn't reveal how the exploit works exactly. "We don't want anyone to run off with it," said Keuper.Both researchers are curious what Apple thinks of the data leak, they said. "Apple will have to come up with an update and then people need to upgrade as fast as possible," said Pol, who still thinks the iPhone is the most secure phone out there.Pol and Keuper earned US$30,000 for the exploit, among other prizes."Any browser exploit is significant," said Brian Gorenc, manager of the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) of HP DVLabs, which organized the competition. But because it is another hole in WebKit he does not think that Apple is to blame. He too, however, stressed that this is a hole that should be fixed. "The guys did a great job," he said, adding that the exploit will be sent to Apple.Read more: http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/3382159/iphone-4s-exploited-in-mobile-pwn2own-hacking-contest-in-amsterdam/#ixzz2CpktqJmY

In the late '70s, when I was just out of college, and even before I began my career as a journalist, I worked in public relations at Hewlett-Packard Co.These were the final years of HP as "the world's greatest company" under its two founders. ... And being in such comfortable and friendly surroundings and working for such an enlightened employer basically spoiled me for any other job thereafter.Indeed, there were only two problems with that job:1. I didn't want to be a PR man;As it happened, the two were closely related. Simon was a great big, linebacker-sized guy who was both whip-smart and tough. He was a few years older than me and was working for a weekly industry newsprint tabloid called Electronic News. EN was notorious for underpaying its reporters (which was why they were usually young and destined to quickly move on) and for having neither the time nor inclination to do much more editorially than rewrite corporate press releases.That is, until Mark Simon came along.He was as young and transient as the rest of EN's reporters; but he was also clever and fearless. Suddenly, under his byline, stories started appearing the likes of which the electronics trade press, notoriously deferential to the giant companies of the tech world, had never seen. Simon broke insider stories, published internal strategy memos and pre-introduced secret projects, all with seeming abandon ... leaving corporate PR departments, like us at HP, scrambling to do damage control and plug the leaks.As the kid in HP corporate PR department, I both feared Simon for the damage he could do with his breaking stories -- my turf was hugely successful calculator business -- and was in awe of his reporting skills. I also wasn't allowed to talk much with him when he came into our offices for fear I would slip up and accidentally give my counterpart another news hook.It wasn't until years later, when I was a reporter myself (and talked with Mark) that I came to realize that all Simon was doing was just good hard reporting. His techniques ranged from learning to read upside down the memos on executives' desks while conducting interviews, cold calling low-level employees who didn't know better than to talk with the press, pretending to know information to get official confirmation, and the whole rest of the toolkit of good investigative reporting.Mark also told me that the biggest source for his insider information was, in fact, the rising golden boy executive at HP, who got a kick out of making controlled leaks to manipulate the press and his counterparts at the company.Mark went on to become a distinguished political reporter in Sacramento for the San Francisco Chronicle. And, having seen him in action, I redoubled my efforts to become a newspaperman myself -- which I accomplished a couple years later. And in those first years in the newsroom, I tried to pattern myself on what I had seen of Simon in action. He was my gold standard.That was a long time ago. But what's important today about that story is that no matter how furious HP was at Mark Simon's ability to pre-announce its products and expose internal company documents, it never once crossed anyone's mind to call the cops on him.

Cybersecurity researcher Charlie Miller and his fellow researcher Collin Mulliner plan to present research on a huge iPhone security hole Thursday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. Not an iPhone virus, but rather an SMS hack, the issue can allow a hacker complete control over an iPhone.According to the researchers, they will demonstrate how to send a series of mostly invisible SMS "bursts" that can give a hacker complete control of the iPhone. That control will include dialing the phone, visiting Web sites, turning on the device's camera and microphone, and more. The hacker will also be able to send more text messages to facilitate spreading the iPhone SMS hack to other iPhones.To an end user, the evidence that someone is trying to use the iPhone's SMS hack on your device will be a text message on your iPhone containing only a single square character. The only way to avoid being hacked would be to quickly turn off the device. In terms of the amount of control, this hack sounds, quite honestly, very similar to how certain Trojans can turn a PC into a bot, and similarly control it remotely."This is serious. The only thing you can do to prevent it is turn off your phone. Someone could pretty quickly take over every iPhone in the world with this."That's a bit of hyperbole, as first a hacker would have to know the appropriate phone numbers to use to hack an iPhone (and there are plenty of phone numbers assigned to other devices). It is obviously very serious, and despite the researchers sharing their results with Apple over a month ago, there has been no movement on a fix as of yet.Interestingly, the researchers also found a similar "remote control" texting bug in Windows Mobile, and other bugs in Android and the iPhone that can let hackers boot the phones off the network. The Android bug has been closed, but the second iPhone bug has not.Miller and Mulliner also found a hole in the iPhone's Safari browser way back in 2007 when it was first launched.Comment and add to the story without registration, but keep the comments meaningful please.

iUsers with unmeddled tech must wait for Apple patchThe latest jailbreak for iPhones, published on Wednesday, exploits a zero-day bug in iOS that only users of jailbroken devices will be able to fix, security experts warn.Version 3 of jailbreakme.com, which also works on iPad fondleslabs, takes advantage of a PDF-related vulnerability in iOS. Users of jailbroken devices can use PDF Patcher 2 to guard against the underlying flaw while users of regular devices will have to wait for a patch from Apple. Jailbroken devices allow the installing of apps besides those approved by the official Apple App Store."It's as serious as last time when jailbreakme.com was using a zeroday," notes Mikko Hyponnen of Finnish security firm F-Secure. "Last time nothing bad happened, as Apple patched fast."Apple does not allow anti-virus software to be listed in the official iPhone AppStore, so there's no protection via this route until a patch for the underlying vulnerability is published by Apple.The "temporary" vulnerability of unaltered iPhones and fondleslabs illustrates one security shortfall of the locked-down walled-garden approach practised by Apple. The more laissez-faire approach followed by Google with Android has seen an upswing in malicious code targeted against Droid phones, however. iPhone malware remains even rarer than the low levels of Droid Trojans in circulation but, even so, the potential for badness is still there. ®

Google launched its first-ever Gmail app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch on Wednesday, but was forced to yank it from Apple's App Store within minutes due to a bug, Computerworld reported."Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS. Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app," Matthew Izatt, a Google product manager, wrote on the company's Gmail blog. "We’ve removed the app while we correct the problem, and we’re working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who’s already installed the app can continue to use it."According to Computerworld, "scores" of users who downloaded the app were complaining on Twitter that they received a "Notification Error" message upon launching the app. "Googla culpa!" David Girouard, Google's vice president of apps, Tweeted on Wednesday, according to Computerworld. "Sorry, but we pushed a bad version of our iOS app for Gmail. More info shortly - we're working on it."Before the app was yanked, Izatt had written a blog post touting the new app and saying it was "fast, efficient and take[s] full advantage of the touchscreen and notification capabilities of your device."Meanwhile, Google has also been rolling out a new look for its regular Gmail service. On Tuesday, the company wrote a blog post giving an "in-depth" look at the new design, along with a video:On Wednesday, as people got a chance to experience the changes from themselves, many have, perhaps predictably, shared their feelings on Twitter.

Like us on Facebook.com/TrendingNow and follow Trending Now on Twitter: @Knowlesitall and @YahooTrending.Just the other day, we were hearing about Samsung getting in legal trouble over patent violations with Apple. A federal court decision ruled that Samsung owes Apple more than $1 billion in restitution. Samsung plans to appeal the decision, saying it never attempted to steal anything from Apple's iPhone.Next week, on September 12, Apple is expected to introduce its highly anticipated iPhone 5, but the company may find itself on the receiving end of a patent-infringement battle. Chinese tech company Goophone is launching the Goophone I5, which looks suspiciously like an iPhone in the company's video on YouTube.In recent months, tech blogs all over the world have released leaked photos and videos of what is rumored to be Apple's iPhone 5. The pictures show what appears to be a longer, thinner, but altogether similar version of previous models of the best-selling smartphone in the world. The Goophone I5 will run a version of the Android operating system that mimics the look of Apple's IOS. Goophone claims to have already patented its phone in China and vows to sue for patent infringement should Apple try to release the iPhone 5 in China as well.One commenter on Goophone's YouTube account wrote, "the clone wants to sue the original...THIS IS THE FUTURE!" Of course, since the new iPhone 5 does not technically exist for the public yet, we'll just have to wait and see.

It’s supposed to be your "life in your pocket," not Apple’s. But a piece of code discovered in the iPhone operating system might keep you under Apple’s control.Jonathan Zdrianski, author of the book iPhone Open Application Development, discovered a URL hidden in iPhone’s CoreLocation that he believes the iPhone uses to check whether any apps on your phone match with those listed in a database of blacklisted applications. Presumably, that would allow Apple to remotely de-authorize those apps, or perhaps even delete them."This suggests that the iPhone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off," Zdrianski wrote. "At the moment, no apps have been blacklisted, but by all appearances, this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for, if Apple so chooses to shut it down."Hum. So then all of those who got away with NetShare before it disappeared from the App Store aren’t so safe/lucky after all.Now, if Apple were more organized with regard to what appears and disappears from the App Store, they probably wouldn’t need this emergency procedure. What’s the point of an approval process if the useless, $1,000 "I Am Rich" app is going to make it out the door, only to be yanked immediately afterward?

Better known for its automobiles, Nissan has shifted gears to the realm of electronics accessories with a new scratchproof iPhone case. More accurately, the cover is susceptible to scratches, but it can automatically "heal" them courtesy of a special paint the Japanese automaker developed in 2005.Dubbed Scratch Shield, the polyrotaxane-based paint has been used on the company's Murano, 370Z, X-Trail and Infiniti vehicles. When gashed, the chemical structure reacts by changing back to its original shape, thus mending the damage. Here's a quick demo from 2008 showing the solution in action:The clip shows a minor abrasion healing over a brief period (the video is only a minute long, but the description sounds as if it's elapsed over half an hour -- impressive regardless). Nissan's press release says Scratch Shield can heal small nicks in as little as an hour, while deeper cuts can take up to a week.Compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, the Scratch Shield case is constructed from ABS plastic and was developed in conjunction with the University of Tokyo and Advanced Softmaterials. In addition to its self-repairing properties, the gel-like paint offers a grippy surface instead of a slick glossy coating.The product currently exists in prototype form and is being tested by select journalists and customers. There's no word on pricing, but if there appears to be enough demand, Nissan will ship the finished product later this year. It's also partnering with other companies interested in using Scratch Shield, such as NTT DoCoMo."We're really excited about the possibilities provided by this technology. In Japan, we've already linked up with world-leading mobile operator NTT DoCoMo to allow them to use the Scratch Shield technology on its Style Series N-03B mobile phones, and we think this technology has real scope beyond the automotive world."

Carrier IQ has been dominating the headlines ever since 25-year-old security researcher Trevor Eckhart posted a paper online saying Carrier IQ was secretly gathering data about users' cell phone activity on the behalf of cell phone companies Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile. The company insists it's not malicious, but that hasn't stopped several parties from suing it for allegedly violating federal wiretap laws.Carrier IQ isn't on every phone - and you can check if it's on yours with a free app from Lookout or BitDefender - but if you have detected it and want to remove it there are a couple options: 1. The easiest is to purchase Eckhart’s own removal app from the Android Market ($0.99), called Logging TestApp Pro Key. You need to root your phone first. And beware: several reviewers have warned that even after you buy the app, you need to donate money before it works. 2. The other way is to flash your Android smartphone with a custom ROM that doesn't contain Carrier IQ. The most popular is CyanogenMod, which gives you an option to opt out of data logging. "We at CyanogenMod would like everyone to know that if you are running our software, you are not running theirs," CM wrote in a blog post.Check out a video demo below from 'AbrahamsTech' of how to do this. As for iOS devices, you can really only block Carrier IQ. For those running iOS 5 and above, simply click into Settings/General/About/Diagnostics & Usage, and hit “Don’t Send.” If you're stuck on iOS 3 or 4, or have a jailbroken device, Chpwn’s instructions should do the trick. Apple told my colleague Chloe Albanesiusthat it stopped supporting Carrier IQ on most of its devices with iOS 5 and will remove it from all products in a future software update—most likely an incremental one rather than a full update like iOS 6.Although Carrier IQ says its software is intended to help its clients monitor network performance and it denies gathering any personal information from users like screen shots or the content of their text messages and emails, many people still loathe the idea of a company recording how they use their phones.For more from Sara, follow her on Twitter @sarapyin.

Popular blog, iFixit, which says it takes apart tech gadgets in order to examine and fix them, says the latest version of Apple's iPhone 4 comes with tamper-resistant screws. The non-standard torx screw is a pentalobe IFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a blog post. He said Apple has used the pentalobular shaped screw for versions of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. The screws are so rare, he said he couldn't find a single supplier that made it.Wiens says the screw, which he says is roughly a millimeter across in size, is an effort by Apple to make the iPhone 4 impossible dissemble and keep its repair in their hands. Apple has traditionally has liked to maintain complete control over its products.The iPhone 4 is an easy device to work on. Because it's an easy device, that's why they are locking it out, Wiens said. He compared device hardware to a car, and his blog to a third-party auto repair shop.  If you buy a car, you can do what you want with it. It's the same thing with your phone. It's not Apple's phone, it's your phone.To solve the problem, iFixit says it's offering a $10 iPhone 4 Liberation Kit. The kit comes with a pentalobe screwdriver, replacement Phillips screws and a Phillips screwdriver. Wiens does not recommend repeated use of the pentalobe screwdriver, saying it's a hack to get the screws out and then replace them with standard screws. He says the screwdrivers were custom made.iFix is not the only one to have noticed the problem.Another pentalobe screwdriver is being offered by Silverhill Tools on Amazon, for seven dollars.iFixit says the iPhone 4 originally shipped with easy to disassemble Phillips #00 screws. However, the company is now shipping production of new U.S. units with the pentalobe screws. He also says when people take their iPhone in for service, Apple employees will switch the Phillips screw with the pentalobe screw.This is a design to decrease the life of these devices, which increases Apple's revenue cause you have to buy a replacement, Wiens said.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Many iPhone users arrived at work an hour late this morning after a glitch caused their smartphone's alarm to malfunction.In the latest clock woe to strike the Apple device, some phones rang their alert an hour late, while others were an hour early and many didn't ring at all.Users who missed appointments took to Twitter and other blogging sites to vent their frustration.One person who had an unexpected lie-in Tweeted: 'It was set for 8 but went off at 7 I then set it for 9 and it went off at 9'.The glitch is thought to have been caused by the change to British Summer Time in the early hours of Sunday morning.But for all of its fancy features, the iPhone has had trouble telling the time of late, particularly when the clocks go back or forward an hour.A clock malfunction prevented alarms from sounding for the first three days of the New Year, leading to complaints from users that they had missed flights or were late to arrive at work.The devices also struggled to adjust to the end of U.S. daylight savings time in November.One possible solution is to shut down and restart the phone or switch it to 'airplane mode' and then back again - advice that is too little, too late for those who slept in.Apple was embroiled in publicity problems in July last year after the launch of the iPhone 4, when reports about bad reception snowballed and forced the company to call a news conference to address the issue, dubbed 'antennagate'.This had no visible impact on Apple's sales as the company sold more than 14million iPhones in the quarter ending last September, more than ever before.Apple reached another milestone earlier this month when it sold between 500,000 and a million iPad 2 tablet computers in the U.S. alone.People across America queued for hours to become one of the first to buy the must-have gadget.The pattern was repeated in the UK on Friday when the iPad 2 went on sale here. It was sold out by lunchtime on Saturday.

You can make calls, read books, and listen to music on this flexible computer from Canada. But do you really want to keep bending it to make it work?How many times have you wanted to smash your phone when talking to annoying people? Thanks to research at Queen's University in Canada, you'll soon be able to crush that handset mercilessly. Well, almost.The e-paper prototype PaperPhone has a 3.75-inch thin-film display and developers call it the world's first flexible smartphone (remember Nokia's patent application for one?). It can do everything a smartphone can, such as make calls, display books, and play music."This is the future. Everything is going to look and feel like this within five years," Queen's Human Media Lab Director Roel Vertegaal was quoted as saying in a release.As seen in the vid below, the prototype is based on e-ink technology and is more like a bendable plastic sheet about the thickness of a conference badge. It can be operated by bending the corners to turn a page, squeezing to make a call, and even written on with a pen.The lab has also been working on video game screens that are bent as a control input.Larger versions of the displays could eliminate paper and printers from offices, according to Vertegaal. E-ink displays require no power until the screen is refreshed, but for the time being the PaperPhone display is connected to an external power source.Vertegaal, who collaborated with researchers Byron Lahey and Win Burleson of the Motivational Environments Research Group at Arizona State University, is set to discuss the prototype at the Computer Human Interaction 2011 conference next week in Vancouver.So how flexible is it, really? Can it be crumpled up?"We haven't actually tried that--creasing it," Vertegaal told PC Mag. "It's a $7,000 prototype, so we're pretty careful with it. If you were to put a crease in it, you would break it. But there are engineering solutions for that."

HTC has filed a law suit against Apple seeking a ban on imports of Asian-manufactured iPhones, iPods and iPads into the United States.The HTC caction alleges that Apple products infringed five HTC patents and seeks to have them barred from sale in the United States from their manufacturing facilities in Asia. Apple declined to comment."We are taking this action against Apple to protect our intellectual property, our industry partners, and most importantly our customers that use HTC phones," HTC vice president for North America Jason Mackenzie said."HTC believes the industry should be driven by healthy competition and innovation that offer consumers the best, most accessible mobile experiences possible," Mackenzie said in a statement.HTC, which stands for High Tech Computer, is Taiwan's leading smartphone maker. It is already the target of a patent suit by Apple filed in March alleging infringement of 20 iPhone patents including "user interface, underlying architecture and hardware". Apple too wants a ban on sales of HTC devices in the dispute.HTC makes handsets for a number of leading US companies and is the manufacturer of the Nexus One unveiled by Apple rival Google in January. It also makes other Android-based phones, including the Desire, sold in Australia, which some believe is a potential iPhone killer.While Apple's lawsuit against HTC did not name Google as a defendant, it was seen as a strategic move against Google, whose free mobile software also powers handsets from Samsung Electronics, Motorola and others.HTC's complaints re unlikely to block sales of Apple products any time soon. Patent disputes are common among technology companies and often take years to resolve. The cases often lead to licensing agreements rather than outright bans on imports.The wild success of the first iPhone, which launched in 2007, prompted other mobile phone phone makers to rush out touch-screen smart phones of their own in a bid to lure consumers, not just business users attached to their BlackBerry phones.At the end of 2009, iPhones made up about 14 per cent of smart phones sold worldwide, according to the research group Gartner. Apple inched closer to BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, which had 20 per cent of sales. But Android phones, while accounting for only four per cent of sales, grew at a faster rate than Apple last year.Apple is also being sued by Nokia for patent infringement. It has fired a countersuit against the Finnish mobile phone giant.Canada's Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, has also had its share of patent woes and was accused of patent infringement by US mobile phone maker Motorola in a suit filed in January.

Customers who bought Samsung's Android phones since 2010 may not have been as confused as Apple says, according to an internal survey released on Monday evening as evidence in the ongoing Apple v. Samsung trial. Apple conducted the survey and published it internally in January of 2011, as noted by CNET. The goal was to see what reasons customers had for buying an Android device instead of an iPhone, and the results aren't likely to bode well for the company's arguments in court.According to the survey, conducted in 2010, 48 percent of customers bought an Android device to stay with their own wireless carrier. In essence, this is exactly the kind of market data that likely pushed Apple to introduce the CDMA iPhone 4 to Verizon in early 2011, with Sprint coming later in the year along with the introduction of the iPhone 4S. Since the iPhone was only available through AT&T in 2010, it's clear that a good number of customers weren't willing to switch carriers for the iPhone after all.But there were other reasons for customers to buy Android phones, too. Thirty-six percent said they bought their devices because they trusted Google's brand, and another 30 percent liked the larger screens offered by Android devices. (Size really does matter for some customers.) The other stats were pretty interesting too: 27 percent prefer the Android Market for apps, 26 percent wanted better integration with Google's services, and 26 percent simply wanted "the latest and greatest smartphone," which was apparently an Android device at the time of purchase. Twenty-five percent also said they simply wanted the latest technology.Aside from the first reason (wanting to stay with a carrier), the results seem to support Samsung's argument that its devices are indeed differentiated enough from Apple's to attract customers on their own merits. An Apple-hired expert argued in court on Friday that the company had polled customers to see whether they could tell the difference between Apple and Samsung devices, finding that many could not. But Samsung's attorney argued that the research was flawed, in part because Apple showed photos of the devices instead of the devices themselves.

A US hacker who gained notoriety for unlocking Apple's iPhone as a teenager has told BBC News that he has now hacked Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3). George Hotz said the hack, which could allow people to run pirated games or homemade software, took him five weeks. He said he was still refining the technique but intended to post full details online soon. The PS3 is the only games console that has not been hacked, despite being on the market for three years. "It's supposed to be unhackable - but nothing is unhackable," Mr Hotz told BBC News. "I can now do whatever I want with the system. It's like I've got an awesome new power - I'm just not sure how to wield it." Sony said it was "investigating the report" and would "clarify the situation" when it had more information. Mr Hotz said that he had begun the hack last summer when he had spent three weeks analysing the hardware. After a long break, he spent a further two weeks cracking the console, which he described as a "very secure system". He said that he was not yet ready to reveal the full details of the hack but said that it was "5% hardware and 95% software". The hack could allow gamers to play pirated games "You can use hardware to inject an insecurity and then you can build on that," he said. He admitted that he had not managed to hack the whole system, including the protected memory, but had worked out ways to trick the console into doing what he wanted. Mr Hotz said that he was continuing to work on the hack and, once finished, would publish details online in a similar way to his previous iPhone exploits. In particular, he said, he would publish details of the console's "root key", a master code that once known would make it easier for others to decipher and hack other security features on the console. He said his motivation was "curiosity" and "opening up the platform". "To tell you the truth, I've never really played a PS3," he said. "I have one game, but I've never really played it." Opening the system could allow people to install other operating systems on their console and play homemade games, he said. In addition, he said, the hack would allow people to play older PS2 games on their consoles. Recent versions of the PS3 do not have the ability to play PS2 games after Sony controversially removed a piece of hardware. He admitted that it could also allow people to run pirated games. "I'm not going to personally have anything to do with that," he told BBC News. Gaming firms do not take the issue of game piracy and console modification lightly. Recently, Microsoft disconnected thousands of gamers from its online gaming service Xbox Live for modifying their consoles to play pirated games. Mr Hotz said that the nature of his PS3 hack means that Sony may have difficulty patching the exploit. "We are investigating the report and will clarify the situation once we have more information," said a Sony spokesman. Mr Hotz rose to fame in 2007 at the age of 17 when he unlocked the iPhone, which could only be used on the AT&T network in the US at launch. The hack allowed the popular handset to be used on any network. He has since released various other hacks, allowing people to unlock later versions of the popular handset.

Cops love finding iPhones at crime scenes because the phones carry so much priceless data about your usage habits, or as the cops call it, evidence. That email you typed months back about feeling stabby when you drink? It’s still there because there because the iPhone captures everything you type to help fuel its spellcheck abilities—even emails you thought you deleted. And that’s not all.Every time an iPhone user closes out of the built-in mapping application, the phone snaps a screenshot and stores it. Savvy law-enforcement agents armed with search warrants can use those snapshots to see if a suspect is lying about whereabouts during a crime.iPhone photos are embedded with GEO tags and identifying information, meaning that photos posted online might not only include GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken, but also the serial number of the phone that took it.Even more information is stored by the applications themselves, including the user’s browser history. That data is meant in part to direct custom-tailored advertisements to the user, but experts said some of it could be useful to police.Just as users can take and store a picture of their iPhone’s screen, the phone itself automatically shoots and stores hundreds of such images as people close out one application to use another. “Those screen snapshots can contain images of e-mails or proof of activities that might be inculpatory or exculpatory,” [said John B. Minor, a member of the International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners].

Path has released a new version of the app which asks for permission before it sends your address book to its servers and has blogged about the episode.Dave Morin, the CEO of Path has responded in the comments and I’ve pasted it below. As an aside – never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this to blow up like this. I hope we can keep calm and continue to discuss this sensibly.Arun, thanks for pointing this out. We actually think this is an important conversation and take this very seriously. We upload the address book to our servers in order to help the user find and connect to their friends and family on Path quickly and effeciently as well as to notify them when friends and family join Path. Nothing more. We believe that this type of friend finding & matching is important to the industry and that it is important that users clearly understand it, so we proactively rolled out an opt-in for this on our Android client a few weeks ago and are rolling out the opt-in for this in 2.0.6 of our iOS Client, pending App Store approval.It all started innocently enough. I was thinking of implementing a Path Mac OS X app as part of our regularly scheduled hackathon. Using the awesome mitmproxy tool which was featured on the front page of Hacker News yesterday, I started to observe the various API calls made to Path’s servers from the iPhone app. It all seemed harmless enough until I observed a request to .Upon inspecting closer, I noticed that my entire address book (including full names, emails and phone numbers) was being sent as a plist to Path. Now I don’t remember having given permission to Path to access my address book and send its contents to its servers, so I created a completely new “Path” and repeated the experiment and I got the same result – my address book was in Path’s hands.Disclaimer: I’m not insinuating that Path is doing something nefarious with my address book but I feel quite violated that my address book is being held remotely on a third-party service. I love Path as an iOS app and I think there are some brilliant people working on it, but this seems a little creepy. I wonder how many other iOS apps actually do the same…As soon as you create a new account to Path, a call is made to with your first name, last name, gender and password. An plist is returned which contains the user’s ID as well as other information such as the date of creation.This API call uses basic HTTP authentication (with a certain key) to obtain some metadata about myself – from the binary plist file it looks like it contains my first name, last name, cover photo, profile picture, etc.This is the actual offending call which uploads my entire address book to Path.This is followed by normal API calls which among others, updates my location, fetches my activity stream and tracks events within the app using Mixpanel.This has been tried out on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.

I realize that freedom of speech doesn't extend to your interactions with private parties, but it's still a tenant I think is important. Removing apps because people disagree with their content sets a bad precedent, even though I'm disgusted by this one.Actions like this mean you are not in control of your own devices. This is why I don't own an iPhone. I'm not interested in having what I can and can't use my phone for change at the whims of Steve Jobs. As an Android user, I'm glad Google sticks to its policy of only removing apps in cases of copyright infringement or malicious code.Consider the case when the ACLU defended the KKK's right to non-libel free speech. They got a lot of flak for doing so, but they defended themselves by saying that freedom of speech isn't really free if we selectively remove it from those with whom we disagree. They weren't defending their right to do anything downright malicious either. I think the catalyzing even was that there was some sort of community event that openly invited any interested organizations to come, but they blocked the KKK from attending.I think the philosophy is the same here, despite free speech laws not applying. This same sort of policy could prevent apps from being published that your average redditor would love, but more conservative types would find offensive.EDIT: I encourage any would-be downvoters to first read this article from AfterElton, a pro-gay blog: http://www.afterelton.com/other/2011/03/disappointed-apple-pulls-ex-gay-app

For many iPhone 4 and 4S owners, iOS 6 has been a mixed blessing. The features are terrific, but many users are reporting huge amounts of battery drainage that never was the case before the system upgrade.As an iPhone 4S owner, I can tell you from first hand knowledge that my iPhone loses about ten percent of its charge per hour without doing anything but sitting in my pocket. I noticed that with the lock screen set to two minutes, and the screen turned off, the iPhone feels quite warm, as if it's doing something.Many have blamed this on the Maps app, but I haven't even run the Maps app, so for me, that isn't the problem.An Apple Discussion board thread has more than 200 entries discussing this problem and some solutions that may provide a fix in rare cases, but it is no panacea for the great majority of users.Here are a few comments from the Apple Support Boards:Only1jb: "Used my 4S the same as every other work day. Usually come home with about 60 percent. Came home today with 17 percent."John Smith 1882: "100 percent at 8am this morning when I took it off the charger. 0 percent within four hours. No calls. No GPS, no Internet use, but battery was dropping one percent every few minutes. I turned off location services, no change."LocalBus: "Thinking of switching back to 5.1.1 now!! 9am to 10:30am the battery drain is 100 percent to 52 percent!!!!! Something is very wrong."There are scores of other  complaints.Suggestions have been offered, such as turning off location services, Maps, Passbook etc. Nothing seems to work for more than one person.The problem is not limited to those on the Support Discussion. This problem is not just being reported on the Support Site. On MacRumors forums, a user with the handle of DArsenault reported that "Battery life on the 4 is terrible. Since I've upgraded my phone drains rapidly when it's not even in use. My phone dropped from 63 percent to 30 percent in about an hour of just sitting on my desk unused."Others have reported no excessive battery drain, but enough have to make this a salient issue that needs to be addressed and quickly. I've gotten used to carrying my two battery back-up cases to just get through the day.We'll keep you posted as more information becomes available, but it seems like a software fix is in order.

As part of its case against Samsung, Apple has shown snippets of an internal Samsung document comparing the original Galaxy S phone with the iPhone.On Tuesday, Apple managed to get the whole 132-page document admitted into evidence. And it’s a doozy.The 2010 report, translated from Korean, goes feature by feature, evaluating how Samsung’s phone stacks up against the iPhone.Authored by Samsung’s product engineering team, the document evaluates everything from the home screen to the browser to the built-in apps on both devices. In each case, it comes up with a recommendation on what Samsung should do going forward, and in most cases, its answer is simple: Make it work more like the iPhone.In short, the evaluation report makes the case that the Galaxy (identified here as the “S1?) would be better if it behaved more like the iPhone and featured a similar user interface. And it appears to play directly into Apple’s charge that Samsung “slavishly copied” the iPhone.Samsung has been trying to make the case that the arrival of powerful capacitive touchscreens pushed the whole industry toward something like the iPhone. This document helps show how one can have a similarly sized slab of glass and still come up short — as Samsung itself concludes it did, initially.Of course, to win its case, Apple will have to prove not just that Samsung made its phones more iPhone-like, but that it either infringed on the specific design and utility patents at issue, or that it infringes on specific design elements of the iPhone and iPad — what’s known in legal terms as “trade dress.”In court on Tuesday, Apple called a number of experts to testify that the similarity of Samsung’s products to Apple’s is more than coincidence and constitutes infringement.Samsung is arguing both that its products don’t infringe, and that Apple’s designs and functions weren’t patent-worthy in the first place.Anyway, have a look for yourself and you’ll see why Samsung wasn’t too keen on this getting in front of the jury. Here’s a direct link to the document if the embed below isn’t working properly.Reached for comment, a Samsung representative told AllThingsD that this document isn’t nearly as damning as it might appear: “Samsung benchmarks many peer companies,” the rep said. “In fact, these are typical competitive analyses routinely undertaken by many companies in many industries – including Apple. Samsung stands by its culture of continuous improvement and innovation. We are very proud of the product innovations driven by our more than 50,000 designers and engineers around the world who have made Samsung’s products the products of choice.”

BlackBerry users may be ready to move on to other smartphone platforms, suggesting that RIM isn't keeping up with consumer demand in its efforts to combat growing encroachment from the likes of iPhone and Android. In fact, two in five BlackBerry owners plan to swap their current device for an iPhone when it's time to upgrade, according to market researcher firm Crowd Science.The iPhone has had a lasting effect on the smartphone market, changing the conception of what a smartphone should be almost overnight after the launch of the original iPhone in 2007. Despite RIM's entrenchment among business users, however, the iPhone platform has grown at a faster rate than the BlackBerry over the last year.Perhaps the trend can be explained by Crowd Science's findings that many are using their smartphones for both personal and business use. Nearly a third of iPhone owners use their device for strictly personal use, versus just 16 percent for BlackBerry users. Just one percent of iPhone owners use their device for business onlyâ€”no surprise thereâ€”so two-thirds are using an iPhone for business and personal use. And, while the BlackBerry has a reputation as the best enterprise mobile device, a scant seven percent of BlackBerrys users dedicate the device to business use only. That leaves over three-quarters of BlackBerry owners using their device for dual purposes.The iPhone isn't the only platform attracting the attention of BlackBerry users, though. Interest in Android-based devices has grown since the introduction of Google's Nexus One, with 32 percent of BlackBerry users surveyed saying they would swap their current device for a Nexus One."These results show that the restlessness of BlackBerry users with their current brand hasn't just been driven by the allure of iPhone," John Martin, CEO of Crowd Science, said in a statement. "Rather, BlackBerry as a brand just isn't garnering the loyalty seen with other mobile operating systems."About 90 percent of current iPhone and Android users plan to stick with their current platform for their next phone upgrade.

About eighteen seconds after word got out that a prototype of Apple’s next iPhone had been lost, found, and then subsequently sold to Gizmodo (for somewhere around $5,000), commenters and pundits everywhere started asking: is all this legal? There are a bunch of complicated laws involving the ownership and selling of lost goods — not to mention lost top-secret intellectual property — and this iPhone seemed to be sitting in a pretty nasty gray area.Turns out, the people of the Internets aren’t the only ones interested — police in the county of San Mateo are curious, as well.The folks at CNET spoke to a source at an unnamed Silicon Valley police department, who said that a “computer crime task force led by the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office” is now investigating the matter.Update: This article originally said that police in Santa Clara county were investigating — turns out, it’s the San Mateo County police. The task force is, however, lead by the Santa Clara County DA’s office.It’s not at all clear who (if anyone) they’re aiming the law hammer at, be it the gent who found the prototype for turning around and selling it, or Gizmodo for buying it. Either way, things get even more complex when you bring in the First Amendment and freedom of the press; what if Giz won’t reveal who sold them the iPhone? Is that protecting a source, or some sort of crazy mixed up obstruction of justice?Giz took things to a new level, for better or worse, in purchasing the prototype and publishing what they did — and if any legal action goes down as a result, it’ll undoubtedly set a precedent. With that said: In the long run, it’s just a phone. No one died, nothing too earth shattering was revealed from a trade secret standpoint was revealed (Gasp! New shape!), and Apple got their prototype back. Sure, it’ll make Apple’s June announcement ever so slightly less exciting — but is that worthy of a mark on someone’s criminal record?

After initially denying that the San Francisco Police Department was involved in searching the house of a man suspected of possessing a lost iPhone 5 prototype, a spokesman for the department has confirmed that plainclothes officers visited, but did not enter, the residence with Apple security officials.The back-and-forth saga over an iPhone 5 prototype that was reportedly lost in a bar in July took on new twists after the San Francisco Police Department first denied, then confirmed, its involvement in the search for the device. SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfeld told SF Weekly on Friday that "three or four" officers accompanied two Apple security officials to a home in the Bernal Heights neighborhood of the city. Though a separate spokesperson had originally been unable to find a record of the investigation, Dangerfeld confirmed the visit to 22-year-old Sergio Calderón's house after speaking with Apple and the captain of the Ingleside police station. The police officers "did not go inside the house," instead standing outside while Apple's employees searched Calderón's house, car and computer. "Apple came to us saying that they were looking for a lost item, and some plainclothes officers responded out to the house with them," Dangerfield said. "My understanding is that they stood outside...They just assisted Apple to the address." For his part, Calderón claims that he was led to believe that all of the visitors were police officers, as none of them identified themselves as working for Apple. "When they came to my house, they said they were SFPD," he said. "I thought they were SFPD. That's why I let them in." Calderón also alleged he was threatened by the police during the visit. "One of the officers is like, 'Is everyone in this house an American citizen?' They said we were all going to get into trouble," he said. But, Dangerfeld said that there did not appear to be any evidence that Apple's security team had falsely represented themselves as police officers. "I don't have any indication of that. I'm not going to go there," he said, adding that he plans to speak with Calderón about the incident. Details of the missing iPhone prototype first emerged earlier this week . Apple reportedly scrambled to recover the device once it discovered it was missing, using GPS to track the prototype from the Cava22 bar (pictured below) in the Mission to Bernal Heights. The incident contains an eery resemblance to last year's drama over an iPhone 4 prototype, which was left in a bar in Redwood City and eventually sold to a publication. Police have charged two individuals with misappropriation of lost property and possession of stolen property. However, Gawker Media, which reportedly paid $5000 to obtain the device, will not face charges.

Thinking about giving away an iPad or an iPhone to promote your company or website? Think again. Apple prohibits third-parties from handing out its mobile devices in giveaways, and although this rule has been in place since January, if not earlier, according to Fortune, the company has just begun to enforce it.Apple's Guidelines for Third Party Promotions decree the following: "iPad, iPhone, and the iPhone Gift Card may not be used in third-party promotions; iPod touch is only allowed to be used in special circumstances and requires a minimum purchase of 250 units; you may not use the Myriad Set font on or in connection with websites, products, packaging, manuals, or promotional/advertising materials; the use of "free" as a modifier in any Apple product reference in a prominent manner (headlines, call-outs, etc.) is prohibited; you must submit all marketing materials related to the promotion of Apple products to Apple for review."Cult of Mac has a running list of nearly 40 sites including Mashable, Geeksugar, and Mahalo that have held such promotions, but none seem to have been squashed. Until now.It appears the Apple fanboys that just can't dole out $500 plus of their hard-earned cash for an iPad 2 have lost the chance to potentially nab an Apple product. While Fortune says Apple has started to shut down promotions, it didn't specifically cite any campaigns that have been suspended.Apple wouldn't comment on the matter.Has your company had an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch giveaway that has been shut down at Apple's request?

Someone on AT&T's product marketing team must be trigger happy as the company once again mistakenly publishes a notice about free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users.AT&T iPhone users will not be getting free Wi-Fi access after all.For the second time in less than six months, AT&T mistakenly published a notice on its Web site indicating that Apple iPhone users would get free access to the wireless operator's more than 17,000 Wi-Fi hot spots around the country.News of free access to AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots was reported on several blogs Friday morning after it was discovered that a notice had been posted on AT&T's Web site. The notice, which was still live at 8:30 a.m. PDT but then was removed by 9:30 a.m., said:"AT&T knows Wi-Fi is hot, and free Wi-Fi even hotter, which is why we are proud to offer iPhone customers free access to the nation's largest Wi-Fi hot-spot network with more than 17,000 hot spots, including Starbucks. Now users can relax and access music, e-mail, and Web browsing services with their favorite blend in hand from the comfort of their favorite location."But Wes Warnock, an AT&T spokesman, told CNET News that the notice was published in error."We have not made any announcement regarding free Wi-Fi and iPhone," he said in an e-mail. "The Web page was posted in error and is being removed."The same thing happened in May when AT&T first launched free Wi-Fi access to its Laptop Connect customers, who subscribe to the company's 3G data service for laptops. Then, like now, a notice had been published briefly on AT&T's Web site indicating free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users. It was promptly removed. And at the time, a company representative told The New York Times that the notice had been published in error.I asked Warnock why AT&T had inadvertently published this information not once, but twice, and he had no comment. An AT&T spokesman had told me when the Laptop Connect program launched that smartphones, including the iPhone, would be added to the list of free of Wi-Fi access later in the year. But when I asked Warnock to verify this information, he again declined to comment.It's frustrating enough as it is sifting through the barrage of iPhone rumors and misinformation on the Web. But to have misinformation disseminated by AT&T's official Web site is even more disconcerting. I'd love to hear what readers have to say on this matter. I can't imagine it's winning AT&T any points among customers or potential customers in terms of customer service.

Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been effusive about the iPhone’s merits ever since the carrier won the right to sell the popular Apple device. On Wednesday, Hesse added another compliment to the list. The iPhone is so data-efficient, he said, it will help Sprint keep its mobile data plans unlimited.That point, which Hesse made in an interview with Forbes following Sprint’s third-quarter earnings, could influence other wireless carriers as well as investors and consumers. Sprint, after all, is the only “big four” U.S. carrier that continues to offer an unlimited data plan with its smartphones. Industry observers often speculate when Sprint will have to adopt tiered pricing like AT&T and Verizon Wireless.Sprint is still not saying when it may make that switch, but credits the iPhone for helping it push the date out further. “One of the beauties of carrying the iPhone is it extends the period of time and increases the likelihood of us maintaining unlimited data longer because it uses our network so efficiently,” said Hesse.There are two main reasons why the iPhone rides lightly on networks, according to Hesse. The first is that the device is good at hunting for Wi-Fi connections and notifying users when Wi-Fi is available. That helps carriers like Sprint offload data traffic from their networks.The iPhone’s other strength stems from Apple’s tight control over iPhone applications. Since Apple makes iPhone apps meet network efficiency thresholds, iPhone apps tend to “ping” networks less often than other mobile operating systems do. Cutting down on app “noise” lets carriers operate their networks in a more productive and ultimately more profitable manner. “It’s almost like a Prius,” said Hesse, comparing the iPhone to Toyota’s fuel-efficient car.Sprint, of course, would like to keep its data plans unlimited as long as possible. The policy is one of the key advantages the No. 3 carrier has over its larger rivals. It is also Sprint’s principal selling point for the iPhone, which can also be purchased at AT&T and Verizon Wireless. “Our main [marketing] message is around unlimited,” noted Hesse. “It is what makes us distinct.”Earlier this month, Sprint ended unlimited data access for users of its mobile broadband and hotspot services. The move sparked chatter that Sprint would cap data for smartphones, too. Hesse said Sprint was forced to amend its mobile broadband policy because of network congestion but that smartphones have not reached that point yet. “Data cards are much heavier users of our network than smartphones,” he said. “It’s still quite profitable for us to keep unlimited [data] on smartphones.”Unlike AT&T and Verizon Wireless, Sprint did not reveal how many iPhones it sold during its launch in the final two weeks of the third quarter. Hesse told Forbes Sprint would not disclose iPhone sales figures until the company had “a full quarter of sales under its belt.” Instead, he spoke more generally, saying Sprint was “very encouraged” by early iPhone sales and impressed by the number of people who switched carriers to get Sprint’s iPhone specifically.Early indicators are important because Sprint needs to sell millions of iPhones to earn back a $15.5 billion commitment it made to Apple in exchange for access to the device. Since Sprint pays Apple around $600 per phone and their contract spans four years, the annual target is about 6 million iPhones.Despite its current momentum, the iPhone isn’t likely to edge out Sprint’s strong base of Android users for awhile. Asked about an analyst estimate that projected the iPhone would soon make up 50% of Sprint’s total smartphone sales, Hesse said the forecast was “a bit high.”

The highly anticipated iPhone 5 may already be facing competition in China -- and it hasn't even been released to the public yet.Recently founded GooPhone unveiled its phone in late August, according to GizChina, and it looks an awful lot like the leaked images of the iPhone 5 that have been circulating around the Web.The GooPhone I5 runs on an Android platform, and may have a 3.5-inch display instead of the 4-inch display rumored to be a feature of the iPhone 5. Otherwise, the two smartphones seem pretty identical.Raw Story reports the GooPhone will include a quad-core 1.4Ghz processor, 8 mega-pixel camera, high-def screen and desktop theme mimicking the iPhone’s iconic aesthetic. The clone also features a honeybee logo on its back panel and boasts a markedly cheaper price: $300 dollars, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.If this cloned phone is the real deal, Apple may have bigger problems than a Chinese price war.According to Gizmodo, GooPhone, the smartphone business of Shenzhen Shenma Lianzhong e-Commerce, is planning on suing Apple if it tries to release its iPhone 5, citing patent violations.Plausible?Perhaps in China, writes Robin Feldman, Professor of Law at UC Hastings and author of the book "Rethinking Patent Rights."“It would be unfortunate if a country’s patent system were designed to allow this type of behavior," Feldman told Wired.“If this behavior had occurred in the United States, Apple would have an action for misappropriation of trade secrets.”In a report released Thursday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, the trade organization warns of the dangers of "trademark squatting."This not the first time GooPhone has attempted to beat mainstream manufacturers to the punch. According to Wired, the Hong-Kong based company has produced knockoffs of the Samsung Galaxy S3, the HTC ONE S and the iPhone 4. In the case of the Galaxy S3, the advertisements used by GooPhone appear to be press shots of the original product.Copied products in Asia are edging into a very lucrative market. China has recently overtaken the U.S. in overall smartphone sales, according to the latest research from the International Data Corporation. In 2012, China will account for 26.5 percent of all smartphone shipments, up from 18.3 percent in 2011 and nearly nine percentage points higher than U.S. smartphones shipments.The other major issue presented by the GooPhone I5 and its ilk are the lawsuits that will surely follow.Apple is currently embroiled in several disputes in China, over the iPad trademark, Siri technology and the Snow Leopard operating system.

Android overtakes the iPhone OS in units sold, while Facebook faces a user backlash. Also: Microsoft unveils Office 2010.Is Google stealing some of Apple's iPhone thunder?Google's Android operating system edged out Apple's iPhone operating system for the No. 2 spot in the U.S. consumer smartphone market in the first quarter, according to research firm NPD Group.According to NPD, devices running Android accounted for 28 percent of the units sold to U.S. consumers in the first quarter of 2010. BlackBerry devices made by Research In Motion, which use RIM's homegrown operating system, took the top spot with 36 percent of the U.S. market. Apple's iPhone, which had been in the No. 2 spot previously, fell to third place with 21 percent of the market.However, Android is an operating system that is available on several different models of phones made by different manufacturers, such as Motorola, HTC, and Samsung.

I need SmartScreen in my iPhone, an application that allows you to place Dashboard-like widgets on the lock screen, so you can quickly access small pills of information quickly without having to get into applications. Smart, smooth, and oh-so-nice.I don't know about you, but I wish I could have access to bits of information in my iPhone without having to access the applications themselves. Calendar, Twitter, weather, Facebook updates... widgets that will only display data and, with one click, go straight to the app itself to do an action. That will allow the iPhone to have a customized front end like the Motoblur in the new Motorola Cliq.Sadly, it won't be available from the Apple iTunes Store: It requires to jailbreak your phone. However, it's completely worth the effort, especially if they include some useful widgets with it. The developer is going to publish an SDK for it:A SmartScreen SDK will be available to everyone in November 2009 but widget developers are being selected to participate in a Beta programme, if you feel you could participate and would like to produce widgets, please email dev@media-phone.ch and we will consider you early access to the programme.I'm looking forward to the widgets people can come up with. I just hope SmartScreen doesn't require me to paint my nails with glitter in order to use it. I like my current fluorescent green, thank you very much.

I was stunned last night watching the evening news. Ögmundur Jónasson, the Minister of the Interior, screaming at Obama in front of the American embassy.Ögmundur was screaming loud and clear but Obama could hardly hear him. He is in Myanmar trying to speed up the democratic process where the military junta has had an iron grip on its people for more than thirty years.Ögmundur was right, it is terrible that 80 people lost their lives (according to updated figures, 110 Palestinians) in the Gaza Strip in just five days.But Ögmundur was wrong to support Hamas, the governing political party in Gaza.Yes, it is terrible that so many people have lost their lives but he did not mention the 40,000 people who have died in the last 18 months next door in Syria. Or the regime in Iran, the main supporters of weapons and money to Hamas.Hamas have been provoking Israel for a long time, shooting missiles all the way to Tel-Aviv. Just yesterday, up to 500 missiles were reportedly launched.Why... their support has been losing ground in Gaza. They know if they would allow free elections, they would lose. People want peace. So the easiest way to stay in power is not to allow free elections and to shoot Iranian made missiles towards Israel. They are trying to win the support of the people in Gaza again by showing they are the strong guys standing up against Israel.At a terrible cost to the local population.But if Ögmundur is sincere he should look at Syria. The situations there gets worse by the day.And there is a real danger of genocide when Bashar al-Assad’s government loses its hopeless battle.Millions could be killed in ethnic cleansing when the war is over with the Alawis, Christians and Druze making up almost one quarter of the population.In the back seat, the Government of Iran.

This is quickly becoming somewhat of a routine event after Apple’s latest iPhone goes on sale: A number of early adopters are having issues with the screens on their new phones. When the iPhone 4 first launched two years ago, quite a few users got devices that had odd yellow spots in some areas, for example. This time around, the issues are a bit more mysterious. Some iPhone 5s, for example, show an odd bubble effect when their users press the screen too hard. Others report that their screens are flickering and are blurry in some areas.It’s not clear how widespread these issues are, but a number of videos that demonstrate these problems have now popped up on YouTube (via Arnold Kim).Here is an example of the odd bubble effect:This user recorded how his phone’s screen flickers for no apparent reason:And here is another example of the bubble effect:On the MacRumors forum, some users also complain about some backlight bleeding issues and on Apple’s own forum, at least one user complained about the fact that the lower part of his screen is blurry and another reported that his phone shows “a wavy line at the bottom and the top of the screen that is slightly discolored.”We will keep tracking this, but let us know if you are having similar issues with your new iPhone 5.

Android devices have outsold that of Apple iOS4 handsets for the first time on record in the U.S., according to a Nielson survey. Worldwide, Android is a force too — up 886 percent from a year ago. Nokia is still the king, but for how long?Sales of Google Android phones in the U.S. are rising so quickly, the devices have outsold Apple handsets for the first time on record. New smartphone subscribers choosing Google phones accounted for 27 percent of U.S. smartphone sales, the Nielsen Company will announce this morning, nudging past the 23 percent share held by Apple. But Android isn’t just a U.S. phenomenon: Canalys today estimates that Android handset sales grew 886 percent worldwide from the year ago quarter.It’s easier to show stellar growth in the beginning of  a product cycle, but Android is nearly two years old. One could make the valid argument that Android really began to mature over the past year with Android 2.1, so from that standpoint, Google’s platform is still an infant when compared to iOS4, BlackBerry and other mobile operating systems. But the uptake of Android among handset-makers is another factor in such growth. Motorola’s Mobile Device division has swung from losses to profits on the back of Android, for example. And HTC — once primarily a Windows Mobile phone maker — embraced Android even as Microsoft’s mobile platform is undergoing a major facelift. The result? HTC revenues were up 66 percent in June from a year ago.As hot a seller as Google Android phones are right now, its user base isn’t the most satisfied with their device. When surveying current Android device owners, Nielson found that 71 percent would buy an Android phone again. That sounds like a high loyalty rating, but it falls noticeably short when asking iPhone owners about their next handset — 89 percent are happy with iOS4 and plan to buy a future Apple handset.Both the Android and iOS4 platforms still trail the 33 percent U.S. share held by Research in Motion’s BlackBerry devices, but for many, BlackBerry needs an overhaul. One half of the current BlackBerry owners surveyed don’t want another RIM device when it comes time to upgrade, but instead are looking at replacements running either Google’s or Apple’s mobile platform. Even with the top market share spot in the U.S., RIM share has been trending down because the current devices are seen as inferior when it comes to browsing or offering apps. That should change tomorrow as RIM is holding a press event where it is widely expected the company will debut its new BlackBerry 6 operating system and potentially new devices, such as a tablet.Given that the U.S. currently has the largest smartphone user base — Canalys estimates 14.7 million smartphones were purchased in the U.S. last quarter — it’s easy to overlook the current king of smartphone sales globally: Nokia. In the second quarter of 2010, the Finnish phone-maker sold 23.8 million handsets. Nokia saw a 41 percent growth rate over the prior year’s second quarter sales, which sounds positive, but when compared to Android’s 886 percent gain, Nokia’s growth pales in comparison. The overall smartphone market is growing, which is lifting sales of nearly all. But some — like Android — are clearly growing far faster than others.Why RIMs Future (Unfortunately) Hinges on BlackBerry OS 6

I woke up this morning overcome with anticipation, just like the 599,999 other people who pre-ordered the iPhone 4. I pre-ordered my phone through Best Buy, and it proved to be a simple and easy process. Obvious "foreshadowing" alert.Unlike Apple, Best Buy didn't have any lines wrapping around their store, having staggered their iPhone pickups to lessen the load on their employees. I had my phone for about two hours prior to everyone else in the office—two extra hours of blissful "Haha's!," until everyone else finally picked their own up. I fell in love with this phone immediately. The hardware is unparalleled, it is beautifully designed and the glass back really does look stunning (when it's not shattered), and iOS4 runs like a dream with the new processor.I volunteered to test the phone all day, doing reception tests, processor tests, and just about anything else to put phone into numbers on paper. Not only did I volunteer because I had the fortune of picking my phone up before everyone else, but also because by doing these tests I got to play with my new toy all day (as opposed to playing with my new toy all day and being reprimanded for doing no work because I was playing with my new phone all day.)The final test I performed was to see how well the reception held up while traveling by car. I took a cab from the Giz office in Soho up to Times Square, testing the call quality and comparing it to the 3GS. I got out in Times Square, and everyone was flabbergasted that the AT&T network didn't drop either call for over a half an hour.Everything was great in my little world—I was in Times Square with my shiny new iPhone 4. And then the inevitable happened—or what, I imagine, we'll come to think of as the inevitable. I tried to do the little trick where you hold the iPhone 4 just with your left hand and all your bars drop away until you have no service. Note to readers: Don't do this in a crowded intersection during rush hour. I felt my phone slip from my awkwardly positioned fingers—it hung for a moment at the end of my ear bud cord, like a bungee jumper moments before his cord snaps—and then I painfully watched as it tumbled over the curb in a sudden whirl of annihilation. The back glass panel shattered, and so did my heart. OK, that may be a little melodramatic…but I am really upset.It wasn't even that epic of a fall. It hit the curb on its side, didn't really bounce and then sort of flopped over onto its back, facing up. The side that made the initial impact didn't have a scratch on it—funny how that works with steel, right? But with the combination of the force of the phone hitting the ground from about three feet up and the fact that it crashed onto an uneven surface (street curb), it never had a chance. From the terrible shrill it made, I knew it was broken before I even picked it up. It's nothing spectacular dropping and breaking this phone. If anything, a compelling display of destruction would have been a redeeming quality.I shattered my phone hours after buying it, in the line of duty no less. If only Apple decided to make the back of the phone steel. Or rubber. Or leather. Or not fucking glass, the most shatterable material known to man. But hey, I'm trying to think optimistically here; at least it wasn't the front screen that cracked, and the look gives it character... I guess.

Apple insiders have offered additional insight into why Papermaster may have parted ways with the company, the Wall Street Journal reports.Papermaster "didn't appear to have the type of creative thinking expected at Apple and wasn't used to Apple's corporate culture, where even senior executives are expected to keep on top of the smallest details of their areas of responsibility and often have to handle many tasks directly, as opposed to delegating them," writes the Wall Street Journal, citing "several people familiar with Mr. Papermaster's situation." The report adds Papermaster "had difficulty maneuvering Apple's internal politics" and had a "falling out" with Steve Jobs, whose confidence he had lost "months ago."--CUPERTINO, California — An Apple Inc. executive whose responsibilities include iPhone hardware is leaving the company in the wake of antenna problems with the newest version of the smart phone.Apple was forced to offer a free fix after consumers complained and numerous media outlets reported a problem with dropped calls.Mark Papermaster, Apple's senior vice president of iPhone and iPod hardware engineering, is leaving the company, according to Apple spokesman Steve Dowling.Dowling wouldn't comment beyond a brief statement or say whether Papermaster was fired or is leaving voluntarily.Papermaster's departure comes weeks after Apple announced it will give free protective cases to buyers of its latest iPhone model to alleviate the so-called "death grip" problem: holding the phone with a bare hand can muffle the wireless signal.The antenna problems were a rare glitch in Apple's rollout for a new product.Consumer Reports refused to recommend the iPhone 4 and called on Apple to compensate buyers.Die-hard fans of the Apple's products have dubbed the stumble "antennagate."Bob Mansfield, Apple's senior vice president of Macintosh hardware engineering, will assuming Papermaster's responsibilities, Dowling said.Mansfield oversees groups that components for the iPhone and iPod touch, including the A4 chip, Retina display and touch screens.Papermaster, who came to Apple in 2008 from IBM, could not be reached for comment at a phone number listed under his name.

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

Cops love finding iPhones at crime scenes because the phones carry so much priceless data about your usage habits, or as the cops call it, evidence. That email you typed months back about feeling stabby when you drink? It’s still there because there because the iPhone captures everything you type to help fuel its spellcheck abilities—even emails you thought you deleted. And that’s not all.Every time an iPhone user closes out of the built-in mapping application, the phone snaps a screenshot and stores it. Savvy law-enforcement agents armed with search warrants can use those snapshots to see if a suspect is lying about whereabouts during a crime.iPhone photos are embedded with GEO tags and identifying information, meaning that photos posted online might not only include GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken, but also the serial number of the phone that took it.Even more information is stored by the applications themselves, including the user’s browser history. That data is meant in part to direct custom-tailored advertisements to the user, but experts said some of it could be useful to police.Just as users can take and store a picture of their iPhone’s screen, the phone itself automatically shoots and stores hundreds of such images as people close out one application to use another. “Those screen snapshots can contain images of e-mails or proof of activities that might be inculpatory or exculpatory,” [said John B. Minor, a member of the International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners].

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

Materials in the low-end model of Apple Inc.'s /quotes/zigman/68270/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.85% new iPhone 5 cost $199, according to a physical teardown by market-research provider IHS Inc. /quotes/zigman/368690/quotes/nls/ihs IHS -0.75% .Meanwhile, the 16-gigabyte iPhone 5 cost $207 to manufacture, the firm said.Earlier this month, the firm's virtual teardown estimated the combined cost of the components for the iPhone 5--what is known as a bill of materials--at $197, or only $9 more than for the iPhone 4S.The iPhone 5 is Apple's first smartphone to work on high-speed fourth-generation cellular networks, using the Long-Term Evolution, or LTE, technological standard. The consumer price of the base model iPhone 5 is the same as for the 4S.IHS said the bill for parts in the 32-gigabyte version increased to $209.00, pushing the total manufacturing cost to $230."The iPhone 5 exhibits a great deal of similarity to the iPhone 4S in terms of component suppliers," said Andrew Rassweiler, senior principal analyst of teardown services for IHS. "But beyond this superficial resemblance, there are some critical changes to product design and parts that enable major upgrades that improve user experience."These changes include a faster applications processor, larger display and a high-speed 4G LTE air interface, the firm said.New suppliers for the iPhone 5 include SanDisk Corp. /quotes/zigman/54370/quotes/nls/sndk SNDK -1.17% , which contributed the NAND flash memory. The firm said this is first time that SanDisk NAND has been found in an iPhone examined by IHS. The firm's iPhone 4S teardown showed the NAND supplier was Samsung Electronics Co. (SSNHY, 005930.SE).However, IHS said Samsung, SK Hynix Inc. (HXSCF, 000660.SE) and Toshiba Corp. (TOSYY, 6502.TO) could also serve as Apple's sources because the NAND component is a commodity part available from multiple suppliers.Elpida Memory Inc. replaced Samsung as the supplier of the SDRAM in the iPhone 5 analyzed by IHS. But IHS said Samsung and Hynix could also be supplying this widely available memory part.

AT&T is making an attempt to quietly settle with the iPhone user who was recently awarded $850 in a lawsuit over AT&T's data-throttling practices, but the user in question doesn't want any part of it. Instead, he's committed to fighting AT&T and hopes other subscribers follow his example by taking AT&T to court over the throttling of supposed "unlimited" data plans, and has taken his cause to a website called PublikDemand to get others involved.Matthew Spaccarelli won an $850 judgement against AT&T in a California small-claims court in late February when the court found that it wasn't fair for AT&T to slow down data speeds under his iPhone's unlimited data plan. Spaccarelli had argued that he was being throttled after using 1.5GB to 2GB of data in one billing cycle—well within the 3GB tiered plan AT&T currently offers to customers for the same price ($30 per month) as the now-defunct unlimited plan.When AT&T phased out the unlimited plan, however, the carrier allowed existing subscribers to be grandfathered in and continue using it. But Spaccarelli wasn't just downloading 1.5 to 2GB of data on his iPhone—he was using his phone to share the data access with his iPad without paying the extra fee required by AT&T for tethering/hotspot service. This was a violation of AT&T's terms of service, causing the carrier to switch his plan to a limited one. Spaccarelli complained, however, and had it changed back to an unlimited plan.Now, according to the Associated Press, AT&T has sent a letter to Spaccarelli demanding that he participate in settlement talks or his phone service may be shut down. Spaccarelli posted the documents online—something AT&T's letter specifically asks him not to do—in hopes that his case emboldens others like him to follow suit.  "Looks like #att is threatening to cut off my service if I don't sign a confidentiality agreement to talk about settling. I thought I won!!" Spaccarelli posted to Twitter on Tuesday. In another tweet, he directed users to PublikDemand "to get help with small claims court against AT&T."Correction: AT&T reached out to us for clarification, saying that the letter says if he chose to engage in settlement talks, there would be a standard mutual NDA. Spaccarelli's service would only be terminated if he agreed to the settlement but violated the signed agreement.

Android Shakes Up U.S. Smartphone Market First quarter 2010 information from The NPD Group's Mobile Phone Track reveals a shift in the smartphone market, as Android OS edged out Apple's OS for the number-two position behind RIM PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Android operating system (OS) continued to shake up the U.S. mobile phone market in the first quarter (Q1) of 2010, moving past Apple to take the number-two position among smartphone operating systems, according to The NPD Group, a leading market research company. NPD's wireless market research reveals that based on unit sales to consumers last quarter the Android operating system moved into second position at 28 percent behind RIM's OS (36 percent) and ahead of Apple's OS (21 percent). "As in the past, carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role in determining smartphone market share" "As in the past, carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role in determining smartphone market share," said Ross Rubin, executive director of industry analysis for NPD. "In order to compete with the iPhone, Verizon Wireless has expanded its buy-one-get-one offer beyond RIM devices to now include all of their smartphones." Strong sales of the Droid, Droid Eris, and Blackberry Curve via these promotions helped keep Verizon Wireless's smartphone sales on par with AT&T in Q1. According to NPD's Mobile Phone Track, smartphone sales at AT&T comprised nearly a third of the entire smartphone market (32 percent), followed by Verizon Wireless (30 percent), T-Mobile (17 percent) and Sprint (15 percent). "Recent previews of BlackBerry 6, the recently announced acquisition of Palm by HP, and the pending release of Windows Phone 7 demonstrates the industry's willingness to make investments to address consumer demand for smartphones and other mobile devices," Rubin said. "Carriers continue to offer attractive pricing for devices, but will need to present other data-plan options to attract more customers in the future." The continued popularity of messaging phones and smartphones resulted in slightly higher prices for all mobile phones, despite an overall drop in the number of mobile phones purchased in the first quarter. The average selling price for all mobile phones in Q1 reached $88, which is a 5 percent increase from Q1 2009. Smartphone unit prices, by comparison, averaged $151 in Q1 2010, which is a 3 percent decrease over the previous year. Methodology: The NPD Group compiles and analyzes mobile device sales data based on more than 150,000 completed online consumer research surveys each month.

The iPhone 4 may be available to the general public, but the police investigation into the leaked device that Gizmodo purchased last spring is still going strong. Now there’s been a new development: the EFF reports that the San Mateo District Attorney has withdrawn the warrant it used to search Gizmodo editor Jason Chen’s house last April, when it confiscated multiple computers, hard drives, and other electronics.Update: The Wall Street Journal reports that Gawker has reached an agreement with investigators. Chen’s materials will be returned, and Gawker/Chen will be voluntarily handing over materials deemed “relevant to the case” by a court appointee.The seizure of these possessions was quite controversial — the EFF said it was illegal and should have been protected by California’s Shield Law. When I called the District Attorney about the case in April, I was told that the investigation was on hold as these issues were considered, and that Chen’s property was sitting in a warehouse untouched. It’s apparently been sitting there for months. At the time, I noted how bizarre the series of events were:When I asked if it was typical for the DA to evaluate the relevance of these shield laws after removing evidence, Wagstaffe did concede that it was unusual. Which makes the situation extremely od d— it should have been readily apparent that Gawker would defend its actions using this shield law defense, why put the brakes on after the fact?However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Chen is in the clear. The EFF says that police could “attempt to subpoena the same material without running afoul of section 1524(g) and still proceed with their case.”

 Post-WWDC Keynote, it’s obvious these are not pictures of the (slightly disappointing) 3G iPhone. What can we say? It seemed like a good idea at the time. And Matt was drunk.It wasn’t long ago that my inbox was full of screen caps from an image editing program of a new iPod, it was a fat yet small iPod that we now know as the 3rd gen Nano. We posted the photos and were later told by Apple’s legal team to take them down.A similar tipster tonight has very generously given us these pics of the iPhone 2, or iPhone 3G as some are calling it. Like the Fat Nano from last summer, the images come from Apple or AT&T promotional material that shows not just the new iPhone, but also gives away a couple secrets.It’s thinner than the current model, for sure, with a more MacBook Air-like bezeling. It’s got stereo speakers on the back and what appears to be the same screen as the current generation. But the real news here isn’t the Exchange support, but the front facing camera for iChat AV.Oh yes, it’s there. Not only is the new iPhone smaller and more capable, but it also comes in red as part of the Product (Red) campaign, like many iPods do.Buy a 3G, video-chatting iPhone and fight AIDS. We like it. Hit the jump for the rest of the pics.[UPDATE] After some painstaking image manipulation, the text of the iChat blurb reads as below:Video just became a little more fun. Start a real time video chat with other AT&T subscribers via 3G networking, or with iChat buddies via WiFi. The video calling revolution has begun.So you can do video chat with your iChat buddies, but only via WiFi. Otherwise it’s phone to phone. Interesting.[UPDATE] 2 See that part about about Windows XP or Vista being needed? Many people are saying it’s proof these are fake. No, we think Apple’s launching iChat for Windows, just like they did Safari. You heard us.

Who is she? Chinese netizens are hunting the iPhone girl.China's "human flesh search engine" is in hot pursuit of an unnamed Chinese factory worker after photographs of her showed up unexpectedly on a new iPhone 3G purchased recently in Britain.In one of the photos, a young woman dressed in a pink striped factory uniform and wearing a matching white cap and rubber gloves, is seen smiling and flashing a "V" sign as she leans over an iPhone assembly line.The photos were discovered by an iPhone user in Britain who promptly posted his find on the MacRumors forum, setting off a global chain reaction of media interest and culminating in the quest by Chinese internet users to discover her identity.The term "human flesh search engine" refers to this type of mob reaction by China's so-called netizens (internet citizens) to pool their collective resources in order to track someone down.In China, Apple uses the giant Taiwanese company FoxConn to assemble its iPods and iPhones. The company's main factories are based in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen, the booming city next door to Hong Kong.FoxConn representatives have confirmed to several Chinese newspapers that the woman - dubbed the "iPhone girl" - is an employee of the company.The spokesman said workers had most probably been testing the phone's camera and had forgotten to delete the photos. He said those involved would not be fired for the mistake."Small mistakes are unavoidable," the news agency AFP quoted FoxConn spokesman Liu Kun as saying. "I would call this a beautiful mistake."He said the factory worker in the photos was "quite nervous" after her face appeared on websites and in newspapers.FoxConn, which employs over 270,000 people in its Shenzhen factories, has said it will not be revealing the woman's identity.But Chinese journalists and bloggers have already narrowed the search down to the quality control section on the fifth floor of one of the FoxConn factory buildings - where up to 1000 employees reportedly work.Of the six photos in the set found on the iPhone, two are of the "iPhone girl" and four are of the factory in which the phones are assembled.The images have since been plastered all over the Chinese internet and as of the time of writing, there were over 20 million searches for the term "iPhone girl" recorded on Google's Chinese search site, google.cn.In addition, the domain names iphonegirl.net and iphonegirl.cn have been snapped up by web users trying to cash in on the sudden surge of interest.In 2006, Apple conducted an investigation into the work practises of FoxConn after reports emerged of sub-standard working conditions.Apple found there were some instances of overcrowding in worker dormitories and some evidence of over-working and harsh treatment - all oversights FoxConn agreed to rectify.

All we can say to Adrian Chen is: thanks for taking a bullet for the rest of us.Let's hope this won't become a regular demand before sources agree to speak with writers, but it did make for quite the sight as the tech world returned from the long Labor Day weekend: Gawker's Adrian Chen published a picture of himself today resplendent in a a pink tutu with a shoe on his head after the shadowy group declared in a note left on the hacker document-sharing site Pastebin the following:to journalists: no more interviews to anyone till Adrian Chen get featured in the front page of Gawker, a whole day, with a huge picture of him dressing a ballet tutu and shoe on the head, no photoshop. yeah, man. like Keith Alexander. go, go, go. (and there you ll get your desired pageviews number too) Until that happens, this whole statement will be the only thing getting out directly from us. So no tutu, no sources.The demand came as an online hacker group associated with Anonymous claimed to have posted 1 million Apple Unique Device Identifiers after breaching FBI security. So far, Chen reports, he hasn't heard back from Anonymous.

Nokia has just announced that it has sued Apple in Federal District Court in t"The patents in question relate to technologies for enhanced speech and data transmission, using positioning data in applications and innovations in antenna configurations that improve performance and save space, allowing smaller and more compact devices," according to a statement from the company.Although the wording is of course somewhat vague, the suit appears to hit the heart of what has made applications on the iPad and iPhone what they are. Positioning data in applications has become a central feature -- most of the major ones carry some type of location-aware technology.Nokia's suit surely comes as a surprise to the tech community, as it had not publicly made any indication that it believed its intellectual property rights had been violated. That said, it's not the first suitbetween the two companies: a suit last year involved GSM, UMTS, and Wi-Fi standards. A request for comment has been sent to Apple, however no response has been received as of press time. Also, Apple has sued HTCfor patent infringement. (See also "7 Patent Lawsuits That Affect Your Tech.")More details to come as we receive them.

Wow! After bleeding customers for a long time finally seem to be adding them.I wonder if this blip has to do with Sprint still offering unlimited data? AT&T/Verizon, take note. ugh, don't think so. They might have added 1.8 iphones but remove the ones who were stupid enough to dump their plan/phone and crossover to the apple side. What they don't REALLY show is the number of current customers who switched. Then take away the ones, like me, who have terminated 2 of his 6 lines of service and moved to someone else (the other 4 are soon to follow). I'm sure that 1.8 mil would be more like 200k lines added. Sprint has fallen into the same marketing hype that the other 2 have. They don't offer REAL unlimited. Download a few gigs of streams and you'll see just how unlimited they are.iPhone sales helped Sprint boost its number of subscribers by 1.6 million in the quarter to 55 million. The total is highest in Sprint?s history, the company said.Sprint?s net new customer growth included 161,000 under 2-year contracts, 507,000 buying service month to month and 954,000 buying service on Sprint?s network through affiliated companies and wholesale vendors.Revenues rose to $8.72 billion in the quarter, up more than 5 percent from a year ago. So it seems iPhone prevented people leaving for the most part, not add a lot of new post-pay subscribers. Their first goal was to stop the bleeding with iPhone, which they have done. Now they need to get the new network rolled out, keep it unlimited and then they may be able to steal more customers from others.Uh... Karl's own summary clearly states 40% of those iPhone customers were new to Sprint's network.Sprint should have never put their eggs in one basket. They could have deployed the Wimax network on their own like they started to but decided to spin off and put their money into another company.now they're trying to rebound by spending their cash reserves on the iPhone and are still trying to build another network. without $$$ and a failing credit score; one or both is going to have to give.And Sprint will only stay around if they can get the $$ they need and I don't see that coming from the cable partners on the Clear side. You realize Sprint will rake in massive profits from all those iPhone users every month, right?The wireless market is extremely uncompetitive. The margins are huge. Sprint will be fine.They should have focused on building a good network, and wholesale and prepaid, where they are competitive. They are doing a $5B network upgrade and extending CDMA/LTE to 800Mhz to give more distance/penetration. What more could you ask for? Thats something that should have been done long ago. Its too almost too late to even worry about CDMA when everything is moving to VoLTE next year... LTE hasn't even been approved on the SMR band either so LTE isn't being rolled out on those frequencies any time soon.Using 800 as a crutch to not have to build more towers isn't going to magically expand their network either, they still need to do a lot more than they plan on doing if they want to stay competitive. Right now they really don't offer a significant value over the *other* carriers, especially when it comes to 4G data.

Recording, communicating during protests, political events could be restrictedApple was granted a patent last week that will enable it to wirelessly disable the camera on iphones in certain locations, sparking fears that such techniques could be used to prevent citizens from communicating with each other or taking video during protests or events such as political conventions and gatherings.The camera phone has revolutionized the flow of information in the digital age. Any time a major event takes place, news networks and video websites are immediately inundated with footage and photographs from the scene.That could all change in the future however, with a flick of a switch, according to U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, published on Tuesday, titled, “Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device.”.Apparatus and methods for changing one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device, such as upon the occurrence of a certain event. In one embodiment, the event comprises detecting that the wireless device is within range of one or more other devices. In another variant, the event comprises the wireless device associating with a certain access point. In this manner, various aspects of device functionality may be enabled or restricted (device “policies”). This policy enforcement capability is useful for a variety of reasons, including for example to disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater), for preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter “sleep mode” when entering a sensitive area.In other words, an encoded signal could be transmitted to all wireless devices, commanding them to disable recording functions.Obviously, the way this will be applied will depend on what is determined to be a “sensitive area” by the relevant authorities.To put it bluntly, the powers that be could control what you can and cannot document on your wireless devices according to their own whims.Given that the major technology companies are set to make wireless connectivity a major feature of the latest cameras, this development does not bode well for photographers and citizen journalists who are already experiencing a major crackdown on their first and fourth amendment rights.“If this type of technology became widely adopted and baked into cameras, photography could be prevented by simply setting a “geofence” around a particular location, whether it’s a movie theater, celebrity hangout spot, protest site, or the top secret rooms at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California.”Steve Watson is the London based writer and editor for Alex Jones’ Infowars.com, and Prisonplanet.com.

Physicists find a way to amplify 'spin current,' a significant step in the world of spintronics. Earlier related research made it possible for the solid-state drives found in iPhones and other newer gadgets.In a new scientific paper, scientists in Germany and the United Kingdom have come up with a new technique to amplify the "spin current" of electrons - and that could pave the way for significant improvements in consumer electronics, possibly including storage devices that no require no electricity at all.In an article published online in the journal Nature Materials on Sunday, the team from the University of Cambridge and the University of Münster outlined what may be the next step in "spintronics."This new area physics research is being hailed as the successor of conventional electronics, based on transistor and semiconductor technology. In general, for over the last 50 years, the number of transistors that can be put on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every 18 to 24 months.However, the number of transistors is now getting so large, on such a small space, that it's beginning to hit its physical limits, and will soon reach the size of individual atoms.Conventional electronics have been based on harnessing the charge of electrons. When they move, they generate electric current, which can be used to transfer information. But electrons can do more than just travel in a linear direction - one quantum-mechanical characteristic is their intrinsic spin. Just as an ice skater twirls, so too do electrons.Spintronics makes use of both the intrinsic spin of the electron and its fundamental electronic charge. In theory, scientists say that by harnessing this electronic spin as a way to store data at high-speed and low-power. Conceivably, that could make internal batteries, or even booting up a device, completely unecessary.Physicists already know that a magnetic field can manipulate the spin of the electron, which in turn, will impact neighboring electrons, causing them to also start spinning, generating a so-called spin wave. The scientists observed that spin waves often interact - just like how ocean waves collide with each other."We brought our spin waves into interaction and attempted to see what happens", said Hidekazu Kurebayashi, a physicist the Microelectronics Group at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. "We observed a significant enhancement of the spin current generation."One of the spin wave interactions, the researchers found, generates spin current ten times more efficiently than using pre-interacting spin waves. How to amplify spins even further, however, continues to be an unsolved question - for now."In normal semiconductor electronics, amplification is possible using an electric field to accumulate charges, e.g. FET (field effect transistors)", Kurebayashi added, but "there is so far no way to accumulate spins in solid state."Other physicists say that they are intrigued by this new work."It's an important step forward in the field of metal- or magneto-based spintronics", noted Wolfram Heimbrodt, a physics professor at Marburg University, who was not part of the study.Earlier discoveries in spintronics research in the 1980s paved the way for solid-state memory chips, which are used today in smartphones, tablet devices and an increasing number of laptops. With any luck, scientists say, the current research in spintronics could have an equally significant affect on the next generation of consumer electronics."The challenge is now to build devices where the electron's spin is combined with the semiconductor technology", Heimbrodt told Deutsche Welle. "It may take another ten years at least before we find out how to combine the electron's spin with the semiconductor technology in electronic devices."

They say everyone's a critic these days, but here's a group whose critique matters: European carriers. Reuters has been asking questions at four major European telecom operators and reports that they're all dissatisfied with the company's current range of Lumia handsets. Describing the Windows Phone devices as overpriced due to their lack of real innovation, glitchy due to early battery life issues, and inadequately supported by Nokia's own marketing, the carriers seem to be in consensus about the new phones' failure to put up real competition to iOS and Android. Put in starker terms, they don't believe that Nokia's Lumia phones are "good enough" to compete. An executive in charge of mobile phones at one of the big Euro carriers is cited as saying, "no one comes into the store and asks for a Windows Phone," placing at least some of the blame for the tepid start to Nokia's reboot on Microsoft's shoulders."If the Lumia with the same hardware came with Android in it and not Windows, it would be much easier to sell."Credit rating agency Moody's has also been piling on, following Nokia's recent warning about lower-than-expected Q1 earnings, downgrading the Finnish company to a Baa3 rating and its outlook to "negative." Still, in Moody's more detailed assessment, Nokia is expected to be "accepted in the market in 2012," with Windows Phone becoming the third leading mobile platform behind iOS and Android.

Never before in the recent history of Apple product announcements has the famously tight-lipped company confirmed the name of a gadget in advance. But that’s what happened Tuesday when the invites arrived for a special event on September 12 — featuring a giant 5 in the shadow of the date.Apple famously wrong-footed the media around this time last year, announcing the iPhone 4S after every outlet on the planet had predicted the device would be called the iPhone 5. No clues as blatant as this one had been offered beforehand, and as a result, many attendees at the product launch felt underwhelmed.SEE ALSO: New iPhone Blues: Why Apple’s CEO Doesn’t Care What You Hoped to SeeThe process happened again in March of this year, when Apple watchers were expecting an iPad 3 or iPad HD — only to be greeted with a tablet that the Cupertino company simply called “the new iPad.”Even prior to the original iPhone announcement in 2007, there was some doubt as to whether the device would actually be called an iPhone. Cisco already had an IP telephony product with that name; not until Steve Jobs pulled one out on stage at Moscone West in San Francisco did it emerge that the two companies had come to an agreement.So that giant shadowy 5 could well be a sign that Apple is going to be a little less mysterious in its product launch process from this point on; that it feels some of the frenzied speculation could actually be doing it harm. Perhaps it wants to make clear we won’t be talking about “the new iPhone” eight days from now. The iPhone numbering system lives on.Indeed, if the iPhone 5 is little more than the incremental innovations we’ve been hearing about — a longer, thinner screen, a smaller dock connector, and no NFC (near-field communications, which would allow you to pay in stores with your phone) — it may be a prudent move for the company to deflate the bubble of speculation a little.Which isn’t to say there is no mystery surrounding the September 12 event. We still don’t know if Apple will debut the much-anticipated iPad Mini there, or leave that for a separate event later in the fall.What are you expecting to see in the iPhone 5? Let us know in the comments.

An app that features a less than entirely honest Hollywood wheeler-dealer has been removed from Apple's App Store after a complaint from a super agent.I am sure honest Hollywood agents do exist. It's just that they don't seem to employ the finest PR firms to proselytize their honesty.This might explain why Oisin Hanrahan, the Irish creator of an iPhone app called SuperAgent, decided that the main character in his game might be a few scruples short of Mother Teresa.SuperAgent seems to have been well received, a reception that might have led to its being noticed by, well, Hollywood super agents.According to the Independent, one super agent may have enjoyed a particular interest in this app. His name is Ari Emanuel. He is the agent for so many important acting citizens such as Robert De Niro and Sacha Baron Cohen as well as directors such as Spike Lee. He is even thought to be the person upon whom the character of Ari Gold is based in the delightfully fluffy "Entourage" on HBO.What is important for today's story, however, is that he has reportedly set his more toothsome legal dogs upon Oisin Hanrahan and his company, Factory Six. You see, the slightly less than honest agent in the SuperAgent game is called Ari.While I leave you to gather your breath for a moment, let me just whisper that it is not the mere mention of Emanuel's first name that appears to have ruffled his hairline.The Independent kindly offers details of the cease-and-desist letter that has caused Apple to remove SuperAgent from the App Store."The game uses the name 'Ari' for the main character, which clearly is a reference to Mr Emanuel, the co-chief executive officer of WME, one of the world's premier talent agencies," begins the forceful cease-and-desist letter.It continues as forcefully it began: "[It] clearly intends to capitalize on using Mr Emanuel's and WME's names for the game and possibly mislead the public into thinking that Mr Emanuel and/or WME endorse the game - effectively trading off the goodwill, reputation and fame established by our clients."Hanrahan deftly told the Independent that because of the "Entourage" series, "Ari" is a name that symbolizes Hollywood in general, not one person in particular. He added: "We're a very small firm, of just three people, and since Apple pulled it we have had no income."I feel sure that many of you will sympathize with Hanrahan's plight. His arguments appear plausible. His game, just as the "Entourage" show, seems but an amusing diversion from the pains of everyday existence.But perhaps others might consider that while saying truth to power is an often alluring concept, one should always think carefully before saying jokes to power. Power is a sensitive soul, one that isn't always comfortable with japes. Somehow, for some powerful souls, taking a joke is like Samson admitting he'd always wondered what it would like to be bald.

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) office, part of the Department of Homeland Security, recently revealed that it will be adopting iOS devices from a variety of service providers for its 17,676 users. It’s a win for Apple in terms of landing a sizeable government client, but also a significant vote of confidence for the overall security of iOS as a mobile platform, given the nature of the agency in question.Here’s how a justification filing posted to the official Federal Business Opportunities government website describes the usage of these iPhones:Part of the justification for the switch (which moves ICE off of BlackBerry devices from the beleaguered RIM, by the way), includes making sure that the product of choice has plenty of market share and “interest by third-party vendors to spur innovation and utility.” It also requires strict OS modification detection standards to allow for the proper identification of potential security threats, and application signatures for custom apps installed by the agency itself.This also opens the door for iPad use, given the language used in the document. Apple’s been gaining ground among government agencies. Last February for instance, the U.S. General Services Administration began issuing iPhones, as well as Android devices, to some government workers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also announced a decision to use iPhone and iPad earlier this year, dropping support for BlackBerry devices after May 12, and the ATF announced a similar move shortly thereafter.Apple has steadily been improving its mobile platform security features with every iOS release, and it appears that those changes are helping the company continue to attract interest from large organizations with data sensitivity concerns. In fact, one of the core security features introduced in iOS 6, Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization, provides significant advantages for those concerned about potential malware infection. Intego’s Mac security blog explains:This means it will take a whole lot more skill and effort to come up with a jailbreak that works for iOS 6 (whether you consider that a good or a bad thing), and it also means it’ll be harder for malware authors to sneak onto non-jailbroken machines.Apple winning away government and enterprise share from incumbent RIM is a great way the company can build up a solid base immune to any changing fortunes between iOS and Android on the consumer side. It’ll be interesting to see how this trend is affected by the introduction of a lower-cost, smaller iOS tablet, if that is indeed something we see at tomorrow’s event.

Nissan isn?t the first name most associate with the cutting edge of gadget case technology, but their self-healing Scratch Shield iPhone case has the potential to be a revolutionary product in an already oversaturated market. The technology behind the ?self-repairing? case technology isn?t new, it?s been in use on several Nissan and Infiniti car models since 2005. The collaborative effort between the University of Tokyo and Advanced Soft Materials INC consists of an ?outer ?paint? made from polyrotaxane, which means that when damage occurs to the coating in the form of a fine scratch, the chemical structure is able to react to change back to its original shape and fill the gap ? ?healing? the blemish? according to Nissan. Nissan soft-launched the case over the weekend at an automotive event held in Dubai. Nissan handed a number of cases out to customers and journalists for beta testing and announced that if the demand was strong enough they would consider mass producing the cases for a release to the general public. Hopefully the beta testing creates a strong buzz, but that all depends on how well the self-healing feature of case works in real world use.The pockets of gadget owners can be unforgiving dungeons capable of scratching the toughest reinforced screens, and cases. However, if the underlying technology of Nissan?s cases has been used on cars for the last five years, I?m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the material's ability to withstand consumers' pockets.

The Wall Street Journal reports (subscription required) that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has opened an inquiry into Apple's rejection of an official Google Voice application for the iPhone as well as the removal of numerous third-party applications offering Google Voice functionality. In particular, the FCC is interested in AT&T's role in the decision-making process.In letters sent late Friday to the three companies, the FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related "third-party applications" from its store. The letter also seeks information on how AT&T was consulted in the decision, if at all.Apple and AT&T declined to comment on the inquiry, while Google representatives have not yet responded to requests for comments. The inquiry, which is apparently part of broader investigations by the FCC and the Department of Justice of possible anti-competitive practices in the wireless industry primarily targeting AT&T and Verizon, was reportedly initiated by the FCC on its own and not prompted by any specific complaint to the agency. Earlier today, Bloomberg reported that the FCC is also taking a close look at rural wireless markets that have no or limited coverage from the major wireless providers to determine how handset exclusivity agreements with those providers are unfairly hindering competition from the smaller carriers that service the rural markets.

Nokia announced Friday that its chief executive will step down and will be replaced by a veteran from Microsoft, as the Finnish handset maker continues to look to create a smartphone that can compete with Apple's iPhone.Nokia announced in a press release Friday that Stephen Elop, who is currently head of Microsoft's Business Division, will become its new CEO on Sept. 21. Elop will replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, the current president and CEO, who has served as the company's head sine 2006. In that time, Kallasvuo and Nokia failed to develop a smartphone that could challenge Apple's iPhone, and have seen their market share slip , even though they remain the largest handset maker in the world. But while Nokia retains the lion's share of overall worldwide handset sales, it is dwarfed by Apple in terms of profit. In May, Kallasuvuo even publicly admitted that his company has failed to make a splash in the U.S. smartphone market, while Apple has taken the industry by storm with the iPhone and its digital storefront for third-party applications, the App Store. The company's best smartphones have struggled to compete in the high-end market with the likes of the iPhone and handsets based on Google's Android mobile operating system. "The time is right to accelerate the company's renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success," said Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors. "The Nokia board believes that Stephen has the right industry experience and leadership skills to realize the full potential of Nokia. His strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company." Though Kallasvuo will officially resign as president and CEO on Sept. 20, he will continue to chair the Board of Nokia Siemens Networks in a non-executive capacity. His severance package will net him 18 months of gross base salary and target incentive, totaling about 4.6 million euros. He will also be compensated for the 100,000 restricted shares of Nokia stock he was granted in 2007, which fully vest on Oct. 1, 2010. "The whole board of directors joins me in thanking Olli-Pekka for his thirty years at Nokia, during which he has been deeply involved in developing the company and its operations," Ollila said. "His dedication and contribution throughout the years has been exceptional. The board wishes him every success in his future pursuits." In addition to competing in the smartphone market, both Apple and Nokia are entrenched in a number of lawsuits related to patents. The first shot in the legal battle was fired by Nokia last October, when it accused Apple's iPhone of violating patents related to GSM and wireless LAN technology. It is believed that Nokia's losses in the market prompted the company to sue over the alleged use of 10 patented wireless standards in the iPhone. Apple responded to Nokia with its own lawsuit , accusing the Finnish company of infringing on 13 iPhone-related patents. The battle of the two smartphone giants is expected to drag out for years, with both companies looking for a court hearing to be held in 2012. The U.S. International Trade Commission -- the group with which the complaints were filed -- has agreed to look into both Nokia's and Apple's complaints against the other.

Fring, an Israeli startup that has a great VOIP/Chat service for mobile phones (see our February coverage), is launching an iPhone version of the service sometime in the next 24 hours, we’ve heard.This is not a browser-based chat app like FlickIM or Mundu. It should be a fully functional downloadable version of the application that allows users to access the fring, Skype, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, ICQ, SIP, Twitter, Yahoo and AIM services.That means they’ll be using the Jailbreak installer, which severely limits the number of iPhone users who will download and use it.But Fring may also be the first really killer application that can get non-early adopter users to consider using Jailbreak. The ability to make VOIP calls over the data plan in itself is probably worth it (although it may only work over Wifi, not the Edge network).This is most likely a test run in preparation for the official iPhone app store that will launch this summer. It’s also a risky strategy – some developers I’ve spoken with are avoiding Jailbreak because they don’t want to anger Apple and have their official applications banned down the road.Fring is doing very well even without the iPhone. The service, which is about a year old, gets 100,000 new active users per month. We’ll update when Fring actually launches the application. Update: It launched. Read about it here. Download it here.

Seeing Han Solo emerge as a frozen block of carbonite was probably the hardest thing for me to come to terms with when I saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time -- I was young and Han is the man. That image will forever be burned into my skull and now another fellow frozen in carbonite has a place up there too. His name is Steve Jobs.That’s right, someone decided to take the Apple’s head honcho and freeze him in carbonite! No not really, it’s actually an iPhone case made of flexible plastic -- not carbonite -- and it doesn’t come with a real Steve Jobs. However, it is probably one of the coolest and most creative iPhone cases I have ever seen! The $35 price tag matches up pretty well other cases out there but, those other cases don’t come with your very own frozen prisoner so there really is no comparison. There were actually a few models; one for iPhone 4, 3G and 3GS and there were skins if you didn't want a hard case.Unfortunately, it looks like Apple wasn’t very happy about the whole deal and they have sent the creators a cease and desist, which is a total bummer but we definitely saw it coming. The cases have actually been on sale since March and with the all the attention something like this will gain it was only a matter of time before they had to stop. Sorry for getting your hopes up, but it was just too cool not to write about. We’ll let you know if anything official spurs from this as a Han Solo in carbonite case would have the same level awesomeness.Related Posts: Review: HBO's Game Of Thrones Episode 2: The Kingsroad The Force Is Strong With America's Best Dance Crew's 'Street Kingdom'Discuss this story in our Movies/TV forums!

About 3-6 months before the iPhone debuted I received a Nokia N800 web tablet as part of the company's blogger relations program. I loved the device. It was one of the most powerful gadgets per pound and square inch I had ever used. I marveled at it.Nokia N800It wasn't the easiest device in the world to use but it had an internal camera which rotated allowing you to use the tablet to videoconference or take photos of your surroundings. It also supported Flash which the iPhone still doesn't.Other journalists and bloggers were blown away by the gadget as well.Then later an N810 device was released which supported WiMAX and had a keyboard built-in.But recently there have been reports which discuss the fact that Nokia is discontinuing the device. One article is from Evan Koblentz who used to work in TMC labs but now WirelessWeek, while another is from Michelle Robert who currently works for TMC. There is also excellent analysis from Greg Galitzine a senior TMCnet editor.Nokia N810 While I read the news I inquired with Nokia about the status of the device and received the following statement from Molly Schonthal at the company:The Nokia N810 WiMAX Edition has reached the expected end of its lifecycle. We will continue to follow the WiMAX network development and new product development decisions will be considered based on the evolution of the business.Any company that sells products doesn't discontinue them if they are profitable. The interesting takeaway here is that if Nokia is still selling the N800 - which it seems to be doing, the incremental cost of making the N810 has to be insignificant. This is the case as long as they are selling some of these units.We have to surmise that virtually none of these devices were selling. This leads us to wonder about WiMAX. Nokia is smart enough to continue investing in a market if it sees the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Did the economy coupled with LTE kill this pot of gold?You may be aware my company TMC has partnered with Carl Ford and the team over at CrossFire Media to put on a 4G event called 4G Wireless Evolution (4GWE) in less than a month in Miami. At this conference we will be discussing the ramifications of the world's largest mobile phone company pulling out of WiMAX. How significant is this development to carriers looking to deploy WiMAX?Does this news mean there needs to be an increased focus on LTE by the entire wireless market? What about the WiMAX equipment providers? Will they make it through a financial storm if the devices aren't there to support them?Remember that Richard Lowe who heads up Nortel's Carrier Networks pretty much blames the lack of devices for lost sales in the wireless space. If there are few WiMAX devices, why would consumers even consider the technology for mobile solutions when they are getting comfortable with 3G-enabled (soon 4G) devices which give them tremendous computing power in the palms of their hands?This two sentence statement by Nokia is worth a trillion dollars of investment in frequencies and equipment. This really changes everything. And it is worth further discussion and analysis.I truly hope you will be at the 4GWE show with us Feb 2-4, 2009 in Miami before you spend another dime on your future wireless networks. Likewise for investors and equipment manufacturers. In this economic environment you need a clear read on where things are going and 4GWE is the one event which will help answer your questions.

You may find it hard to believe, but it’s possible to capture 3D scans with your iPhone using just the screen and the camera. The solution comes in the form of an app called Trimensional.The way in which it works is very simple, but the results are quite effective as the video above and images below show.In order to work you need to turn the brightness right up on your iPhone display, then stand in complete darkness. Hold the phone screen up to your face (around 20cm away) with the Trimensional app loaded, and tell it to starts scanning.The end result is a 3D scan of your face with the quality depending on how dark you managed to get the environment you are standing in.Here’s the full feature list of the first version of the app:For $0.99 on the App Store it gives you a new way to capture images of yourself, friends, or random objects which you can then share with others over e-mail, or manipulate them directly on your phone.The Trimensional website states it works best with iPhone 4 or the latest generation (4th) iPod touch. So if you have a previous generation phone or iPod check the iTunes comments first to see if anyone got it working.One update we’d like to see to the app is the ability to export the 3D model in a standard format 3D art packages can handle.Read more at the Trimensional website

The Federal Communications Commission is examining a recent decision by Apple to reject an iPhone application developed by Google. On Friday, the commission sent letters to executives at Apple, Google and AT&T, which is the exclusive carrier for the iPhone in the United States, saying it was “interested in a more complete understanding of this situation.”In opening the investigation, the F.C.C. cited an article in The New York Times this week describing Google’s frustration in winning approval from Apple to distribute its iPhone applications through Apple’s App Store. Apple recently rejected Google’s effort to bring a service called Google Voice to the iPhone, and the company also rescinded its earlier approval of several applications created by third-party developers that worked with Google Voice.In its letter to Apple, the F.C.C. asked the company to explain why it rejected the application and removed the related applications from its App Store. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment, saying the company does not typically discuss regulatory issues.Google Voice, which is already available on BlackBerrys, provides users with free domestic calls, inexpensive international calls, free text messaging, call routing and other services. In a statement, Google said that its application had been rejected but that the company would “continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users, for example by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.” The company also said it would supply the information requested by the F.C.C..As part of its investigation, the F.C.C. focused on whether the decision to reject the Google Voice app was made by Apple alone or in consultation with AT&T. Industry analysts and others say AT&T has been increasingly concerned about the possible loss of revenue that could result from the Google Voice service. In its letter, the commission asked what role, if any, the company played in rejecting the Google Voice application, including whether there were any contractual understandings between the two companies that would have affected Apple’s decision.In a statement, AT&T said the company “does not manage or approve applications for the App Store.” AT&T also said it would respond to the F.C.C.’s letter, but a company spokesman, Fletcher Cook, declined to comment further.Google, which powers the world’s most popular search engine, has long had ties to Apple, and the two companies have a history of both competing and cooperating. Google’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, sits on Apple’s board of directors.

Sprint has been something of an underdog in the U.S. wireless space for years now, and while the iPhone has absolutely changed the course of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, it has only recently started to ship on Sprint . The first change Sprint had to grab the iPhone came at the iPhone 4S event in October 2010, and while the real numbers are murky, it's estimated that Sprint invested billions over a number of years to make that deal happen. That's a lot of scratch for a carrier that is struggling to maintain a user base, and shareholders are finally speaking up about it. According to Reuters, Sprint's CEO Dan Hesse has agreed to a pay cut after "coming under fire from some shareholders disappointed with the hit the company's results took from subsidizing Apple's popular iPhones." Hesse has said that his salary will be cut in order to repay around $346,000 in incentive pay that he has already received, and he'll also give up additional amounts that was previously eligible for. Here's Hesse's statement: "These voluntary actions regarding my personal compensation, which total $3,250,830, will eliminate any benefit for me to the discretionary adjustment the compensation committee made earlier this year." Yeah, that's a lot of money, but the move will still put him at a salary level nearly in line with 2010 levels, and Sprint still has a long way to go before that $15 billion bet on the iPhone proves worthwhile.

Apple's next iPhone is once again rumored to sport a metal back using tech Apple's had a license to since 2010, but has not used much.After a brief hiatus, the long-standing rumor that Apple will employ more metal in the iPhone, has made a return -- and even taken a new twist.Citing unnamed industry sources, Korean news site ETnews says Apple will use Liquidmetal technology for the next iPhone, which the outlet boldly claims will be unveiled at Apple's annual worldwide developers conference.That conference, which has yet to be announced, typically takes place in June. Up until the last year, it has also been ground zero for the unveiling of new iPhones, including Apple's first-generation model.As for the question of whether Apple would even use such a material, it's been more of when, rather than if. Apple acquired an exclusive commercial license to Liquidmetal in late 2010. The technology, which Apple has used only for the SIM ejector tool it includes with some iPhone and iPad models, is billed as a metallic glass.In its documentation, Liquidmetal Technologies says that the individual pieces that come out of its process offer more strength, elasticity, and hardness than aluminum and titanium alloys, as well as stainless steel.ETnews adds that Apple will not be alone in using a new material for its flagship handset. Citing the same sources, it says Apple rival Samsung plans to use ceramics for its Galaxy S3 smartphone, which is expected to be unveiled next month.This is the latest in a series of rumors suggesting that Apple will use more metal in its smartphone. Last December, Boy Genius Report said that Apple would be using aluminum as the backing of the phone, just like it's done on all three generations of its iPad. Before that, DigiTimes claimed the back of the device would "be changed to a metal chassis instead of reinforced glass." Both rumors were preceded by a 9to5Mac report in March, saying Apple was making a move to metal instead of glass.

AT&T, O2 feels your pain. Like AT&T, the U.K. mobile services provider has seen its network overtaxed by Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone, particularly in London, where a massive surge in data traffic has been causing network congestion since summer.In an interview with the Financial Times, O2 CEO Ronan Dunne said the company has seen an 18-fold increase in data traffic since the beginning of the year, most of it driven by super-smartphones like the iPhone. “Where we haven’t met our own high standards then there’s no question, we apologise to customers for that fact,” Dunne said. “But it would be wrong to say O2 has failed its customers en masse.”Well, that’s one way of looking at it. The thousands of smartphone users who lost data service just a few days ago might see things a bit differently, though. Anyway, O2–like AT&T in the U.S.–is doing its best to contain the public relations damage arising from such outages. Dunne says the carrier has added an additional 200 mobile base stations in London to help it meet data demand and has been working with its infrastructure suppliers on network tweaks to improve data service.Wise moves. Best to act quickly and get out ahead of issues like these, which can become PR nightmares very quickly. As AT&T recently learned, network congestion issues make great fodder for the advertising campaigns of rivals. Wouldn’t want Vodafone (VOD) running its own version of Verizon’s (VZ) nasty “There’s a Map for That” commercials, now would we?

Here’s a list of 10 people who got the Apple iPad review units before anyone else.Apple’s marketing strategy for a new product (like the iPad) works something like this:Phase 1- Steve Jobs will announce the product in an “invite-only” event weeks before the product is actually due for shipping.Phase 2- Apple will send review units to a very select group of people (let’s call them the Inner Circle). These reviewers get to test the product (secretly) for days and, on a pre-decided date, they can push their reviews online.Phase 3 – Consumers can now buy the product. That’s the day when you see long queues of people camping outside the Apple retail stores.We’re still in Phase II of the iPad launch – the first reviews are in and everyone seems to be pretty impressed with the Apple Tablet Slate.Also see: How to Deliver a Presentation Like Steve JobsIf you compare the launch of iPad with a previous Apple product (say iPhone), you’ll notice one major change – Apple seems to have expanded their “inner circle” and, for the first time, they’ve sent review units to at least one person who is a popular blogger but not part of the mainstream media.The list now has 10 names including (clockwise):AOL’s Engadget and Gawker’s Gizmodo are the biggest gadget sites in the world and they probably draw more eyeballs that most mainstream websites put together but they’re not part of the Jobs’ circle yet.Update: Some more people have received review units from Apple though only after the first reviews were in. These include Natali Del Conte of CNET (CBS News) and Michael Gartenberg of ComputerWorld.

Whenever you hear about bugs and exploits being discovered in the iPhone’s browser, Safari, it’s usually the doings of some masterful meddler who devoted hours to unearthing any flaws they could find — not some user casually tapping around the application. Apple’s pretty good at keeping things locked down, and the iPhone’s got enough users that most of the nasty user-facing bugs have been flushed out. Well, except for this new one.It’s not an incredibly common bug, and it doesn’t seem likely that it would hit most users – but for the iPhone users this newly discovered bug does affect, it could mean huge operator fees.The flaw, as discovered by Estonian Apple Site AppleSpot: If the user visits a site which uses Motion-JPEG (most commonly used for security cams and live feeds) in Safari, Safari will continue to gobble up bandwidth even after Safari is closed. Safari is one of the few apps that Apple allows to process in the background, and Motion-JPEG streams appear to continue streaming, even if the stream is in another tab or in the “closed” application. Apple gives no indication that Safari will continue to stream – and considering that most applications on the platform aren’t granted such privileges, it’s unlikely that a lay user would understand the consequences.As mentioned, this bug certainly isn’t one that springs up all that regularly; for it to affect you, you need to not only visit one of these Motion-JPEG streams in Safari, but also be on some sort of pay-per-megabyte plan. While it’s no sweat off the backs of anyone on an unlimited package (as is the case with a vast majority of US iPhone users), it could work out to MASSIVE wallet damage for anyone traveling internationally or who are signed up on carriers that only offer metered data.The original discoverers of the bug claim to have been able to rack up over 740 megabytes in silently streamed data during one hour of testing. If the same thing had happened to someone without a data package, they say that one hour of unintentional data usage would have worked out to roughly 30,000 Estonian kroons in fees – or just shy of $3,000 dollars. Ouch.

The white iPhone 4 looks as though it will never appear on the market due to all the delays. But one enterprising teenager called Fei Lam came up with a very lucrative idea. He decided to import the white iPhone 4 casing parts to the U.S. himself direct from Foxconn. He then offered a conversion service to anyone wanting their black iPhone made white.And guess what? Lots of people did and Lam has apparently generated around $130,000 in revenue so far. He sells front and back panels or full conversion kits for $279 through the website WhiteiPhone4Now with the tag line, “You don’t have to wait until Spring of 2011.”The only problem now is some mysterious private investigator is bugging Lam stating he is selling stolen goods. Lam believes it is Apple attempting to block what he is doing, or some trademark firm trying to make a quick buck by copying the action Apple is taking against eBay sellers.What’s unclear here is how Lam managed to get the parts from Foxconn who are under contract to Apple. Is it a case that Foxconn has stock piles of these cases and just wants to get rid of them, or is Lam’s supplier not really an official contact at the manufacturing firm?One thing that is clear, though. If you want an iPhone 4 in white this seems to be the only way to get one at the moment.There’s something fishy here. If Foxconn is selling the white cases to Lam, then why is Apple not shipping white iPhones already? It could be the batches are so small that doesn’t makes sense to Apple, but Lam buying a few hundred or so at a time sounds feasible.Also, has anyone ever met anyone using one of these kits, or heard talk of them on forums? Do they actually exist or is Lam’s website just a front? I have to ask because I’ve never heard of it before yet he’s managed to generate so much revenue.If Apple knows this is happening then they’d stop the shipments from Foxconn immediately. If they know and this continues then clearly the cases aren’t coming through legitimate channels from the Chinese company.

Microsoft's Office for iPad, iPhone, and Android is a reality. Although Office Mobile has been rumored and reportedly spotted in the wild, Microsoft has remained persistently quiet about its plans for the product. The Verge has learned through several sources close to Microsoft's plans that the company will release Office versions for Android and iOS in early 2013.Office Mobile will debut in the form of free apps that allow Android and iOS users to view Microsoft Office documents on the move. Like the existing SkyDrive and OneNote apps, Office Mobile will require a Microsoft account. On first launch, a Microsoft account will provide access to the basic viewing functionality in the apps. Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents will all be supported, and edit functionality can be enabled with an Office 365 subscription.Microsoft will allow iOS users to purchase an Office 365 subscription within the app, or let organizations distribute codes to enable Office Mobile editing for users. The apps will allow for basic editing, but we're told this won't go very far in attempting to replace regular full use of a desktop Office version.A recent Microsoft press release from the company's Czech Republic subsidiary revealed that Office Mobile apps for Android and iOS would be made available from March 2013. We understand that Office Mobile for iOS will arrive first in late February or early March, with an Android version due in May.We reached out to Microsoft for comment on this story and a company spokesperson says "Office will work across Windows Phone, iOS and Android."

Nokia is investigating reports of problems with its touchscreen 5800 phone in the US, just days after the mobile was launched.The device has been removed from sale at two flagship stores in the US.The problem is with connections to US 3G networks, BBC News has learned.A spokeswoman for Nokia told BBC News: "A small number of devices are not connecting with 3G networks and we are looking through that right now."She said the phone continued to be sold in "certain network areas".At the New York and Chicago flagship stores only the European version of the Nokia 5800 is on sale.Sales agents at the New York store are telling customers the phone has a "little issue" and they are "not being sold at all while the problems are looked into".Nokia launched the 5800 Xpress Music phone in the US last Friday and the device has been described as the firm's response to the iPhone.The European version of the 5800, which cannot access 3G networks in the US, is still being sold and is unaffected by the problem, BBC News understands.In a statement Nokia said the issue was "a very isolated problem concerning only the North American market and is not specific to any other region or country".It added: "Nokia is investigating the issue. Existing customers of the 5800 XpressMusic who experience 3G signal issue with the device are advised to contact Nokia Customer Care."

UPDATE: I have run out of promo codes, but really appreciate all the positive comments and support. If you have feedback, please feel free to email me at jacobu@gmail.com. I can only do some much QA testing on my own, and it's not until something gets into the hands of the masses that it can truly be torn apart :-D. I'll do my best to reply to all your messages and fix anything that needs fixing. I will release a bug fix version within a few days (+approval time, ~2-3 days), and will likely give out more free copies then. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.So for the last 2 months, I've been cranking away on an app called Aetherspark. It's a file browser, storage, and transfer system. It lets you mount your iPad as a disk from any OS (via WebDAV), transfer files to it, and browse them on the device. You can also upload and browse files on your device with a web browser. It even lets you send files between devices (even without wifi). Yes, it's a bit like AirSharing, but the interface is significantly different, and it has file transfer capabilities. It's also cheaper.Here are some demo videos Here's the app store linkI have 50 promo codes (most I can get per version) that I want to give out for a free download, so if you want one, please send me a private message and I'll give you one (if I haven't run out).I'm not only looking to get the word out about it, I'm also looking for feedback (both suggestions and problems you have with it).A slight caveat, the promo codes only work in the U.S. iTunes store. Nothing I can do about this unfortunately. :-(

The annual Pwn2Own contest at CanSecWest is underway, and on the first day Web browsers fell to attack. Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.6.2 on 64-bit Windows 7 and Safari on OS X all were forced to run exploit code. To add insult to injury, an iPhone was cracked and the SMS database lifted from it.The IE exploit is the most interesting because it bypasses both DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), albeit in a very cumbersome way, The researcher, Peter Vreugdenhil, explains exactly what he did in a paper on his web site.Pwn2Own rules require the exploit code to read a particular file on the system in order to register that the exploit has run. But could Vreugdenhil's exploit have written to the disk? It's not clear. Web pages in IE7 on Vista and IE8 on Vista and Windows 7 both run in "Protected Mode," a special crippled user context in which the browser only has write access to the temporary Internet files directories. While exploit code could do some malicious things under Protected Mode restrictions, it could not, for example, set itself up to run at boot or login.The Firefox exploit was performed by Nils (no last name given) of U.K.-based MWR InfoSecurity. Nils is contractually prevented from disclosing the exact details of the exploit for now. He indicated that the hard part of it, as with IE8, was bypassing ASLR and DEP. But Nils also implied that Firefox did a bad job of opting in to ASLR, so perhaps that's a clue to what he did.Over on the Apple front, Charlie Miller exploited a critical Safari vulnerability on a MacBook. Details on this hack are also under wraps until Apple gets a chance to address it.And finally, Vincenzo Iozzo and Ralf Philipp Weinmann were successful in hijacking an iPhone through a malicious web page. Among other things, they were able to read the entire SMS database, including text messages that had already been deleted, and upload them to a server they controlled.Thanks to Threatpost for the links.

With portable navigation systems hanging from millions of windshields and the price point of the popular devices diving down to the $99 mark, automakers’ expensive in-dash nav systems are going the way of the car phone. But with mobile-phone based navigation gaining ground — and the new 3-G iPhone expected to debut on Monday with full GPS capability — portable navs could soon face a similar fate.Phone-based GPS navigation has been steadily gaining ground on portables. Earlier this week, Networks in Motion, the leading provider of navigation services to the top four U.S. cellular carriers, announced that the day before Mother’s Day, May 10, saw the largest spike ever in the use of navigation on mobile phones, with nearly 5 million requests.That’s a lot of drivers finding their way to mom’s house. And looking at a small screen while driving.Portable navigation has experienced phenomenal growth over the past several years, while automakers’ expensive in-dash systems have been shown to increase the depreciation of a vehicle. But the use of GPS-enabled mobile phones isexpected to quadruple by 2011, and if GPS is introduced on the new iPhone, as expected, it could accelerate the shift away from portable nav systems. And as Popular Mechanics reported, leave GPS suppliers "scared %#*@-less." Portable nav heavyweight Garmin already introduced an iPhone-like GPS phone earlier this year, and last week minor player Mio unveiled two similar GPS phones. Now, all eyes will be on Steve Jobs on Monday when the Apple Godhead is expected to unveil the iPhone 2.0 with built-in GPS at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.The market is ripe for it. Networks in Motion, which claims to have a 57 percent share of U.S. revenue from navigation services offered on mobile phones, says that in early in 2007 it had less than a million paid users. Now it has more than 3 million, and in May it reached the milestone of more than 100 million monthly navigation requests.But the biggest challenge will be how to deal with driver distraction issues in moving from the small screen of portable navs to the even smaller screen of mobile phones.Let’s see if Apple will show the way.
