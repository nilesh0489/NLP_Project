A Microsoft executive on Wednesday took a dig at Apple and his own company, quipping that the new iPhone 4 might be as problematic for Cupertino as Vista was for Microsoft."It looks like that iPhone 4 might be their Vista, and I'm OK with that," Microsoft chief operating officer Kevin Turner said during a keynote speech at the company's Worldwide Partner Conference, a video of which was posted online. "That's another mantle [Apple is] welcome to take. I actually read that headline last week and I just sort of had to smile after I did cartwheels, again."Vista is of course, the previous version of Microsoft's Windows operating system before Windows 7, which was plagued by bugs and generally viewed as a poor upgrade from XP.Turner made his comments while talking about Microsoft's efforts in the mobile space, and the company's upcoming launch of Windows Phone 7."One of the things that I want to make sure you know today is that you're going to be able to use a Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you're holding it to make a phone call," Turner said, referring to the iPhone 4 "death grip" issues.Turner acknowledged, however, that mobile has been a challenge for Microsoft. His speech comes just one week after the company killed its line of Kin social phones."This has been tough," Turner said about mobile.With the expected launch of Windows Phone 7 in late 2010, however, "we're back in the game," he said."When you look at this phone ? it's not like any phone you've ever seen from Microsoft, and I think that's a good thing," Turner continued. "We're re-booting ourselves in this area."Turner also discussed Apple's iPad. The tablet, he said, is "fabulous at content consumption, [but] lousy at content creation."As a result, most people are not going to dump their laptops in favor of an iPad at this point."They're generally a third device for most people. That's a fact and that's not going to change," Turner said. "Productivity matters and you can't maximize productivity if all you're doing is consuming content."

As the end of the epic soap opera that is the Apple (AAPL) v. Samsung (005930) trial draws near, Samsung’s turn at the plate kicked off on Monday evening with some interesting events. Apple had gone straight for the jugular with its arguments, stating that Samsung knowingly stole its technology and designs by meticulously examining each key element of the iPhone’s UI and ripping it off in its own products. Rather than get right to denying any wrongdoing, Samsung on Monday decided to take a different approach — prove Apple’s technology patents are not valid because they’re stolen to begin with.To start things off, Samsung targeted Apple’s pinch-to-zoom patent, which the Cupertino, California-based company claims is being infringed upon by a number of Samsung smartphones and tablets. Via Fortune, live coverage of the trial from San Jose Mercury News describes the courtroom events surrounding one of Samsung’s first key pieces of evidence: A giant table.Dubbed “Diamond Touch,” Samsung’s legal team presented a massive touchscreen table built by Mitsubishi to the jury in an effort to show that Apple’s patent on pinch-to-zoom technology should not be valid because it already existed for years before the first iPhone launched. What’s more, Samsung suggested that Apple knowingly stole the technology when its witness, Mitsubishi engineer Adam Bogue, testified that he showed the Diamond Touch to Apple engineers back in 2003.The Diamond Touch consists of a projector and a massive touch-sensitive surface with multi-touch support, on which users can draw and perform a variety of other functions. The device also supports technology that is strikingly similar to the pinch-to-zoom function in iOS, allowing Diamond Touch users to manipulate objects by grabbing the corners of an image or window and dragging.Since Samsung says technology similar to Apple’s pinch-to-zoom function already existed when Apple was granted its patent, the company is arguing that Prior Art should render Apple’s patent invalid.

Apple continued to be on the losing end of a public relations battle Tuesday over a "Not Recommended" rating from Consumer Reports for its iPhone 4. Some industry watchers have gone as far as to suggest a recall is something the company may need to consider.The latest round of bad news was courtesy of Wayne State University Professor Matthew Seeger, who told Cult of Mac that the brand image of Apple could be at risk and said the company will be forced to issue a recall.Others told the Apple enthusiast site that the company needs to act with more urgency, calling Apple's response so far lackluster and even irresponsible. While there seems to be general agreement that Apple has responded poorly, some see a recall as too harsh a step.Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner said in a note to clients that he saw the risk of recall as low, saying the antenna issue was not serious enough to warrant such an action. He argued that Apple should be giving out free "bumpers" to those with problems, and wouldn't affect overall profit margins more than 1 or 2 percentage points.Apple charges $30 for these bumpers, which cover up the metal stripe. This keeps users from touching the lower-left hand corner with their hand, which seems to set off the reception problems.The company is also attempting to control the debate: Apple blog TUAW noted that it had found evidence the company was deleting threads in its support forum that referenced the Consumer Reports ratings at least a half dozen times."It's hard to imagine what Apple hopes to gain by doing this," TJ Luoma wrote.Either way, Consumer Reports' words are having a chilling effect on Apple's stock. In intraday trading Tuesday, the stock had fallen as much as 4 percent over the recall worries. Apple's typical silence on issues like this is probably not making the situation any better.

Apple may have come out on top when a jury ruled that dozens of Samsung phones infringed on Apple patents and trade dress, but that doesn’t mean Samsung and other Android OEMs will simply let the new iPhone 5 hit the market without a bit or resistance. There are at least a dozen Android powered devices being prepped to battle the iPhone 5 in the marketplace, but HTC and Samsung may be holding trump cards that could give them a legal edge to block the iPhone 5 from ever hitting store shelves.It turns out that the iPhone 5 will be using the LTE radio standard for high-speed data transfer – a standard based on hundreds of different patents, some of which are held by HTC and Samsung. According to an industry source, “Samsung Electronics has decided to take immediate legal action against the Cupertino-based Apple. Countries in Europe and even the United States ? Apple’s home-turf ? are our primary targets.” Samsung has not taken any legal action yet, but we expect a patent infringement lawsuit to be filed in the following weeks.On the HTC side, the legal battle is already under way. HTC has presented its patent claims before a US International Trade Commission Judge. The legal battle is still playing out, but Judge Thomas Pender has let Apple know that “Clear and convincing means something to me; I have to be pretty darn certain a US patent is invalid,” when Apple lawyers disputed the validity of HTC’s LTE patents. HTC has been on the forefront of LTE since it launched the HTC Thunderbolt on Verizon’s LTE network in 2011 and has supplied LTE-enabled devices for all major LTE networks across the globe.We doubt that the courts will move fast enough to issue a preliminary injunction against Apple, which would hinder the initial launch of the iPhone 5, but it does look like Apple will be on the defensive this time around. Apple has 434 LTE patents of its own, but all Samsung and HTC need is for Apple to infringe on one of their patents to justify a court ordered injunction against the iPhone 5.While many of you would be thrilled to see Apple suffer at the hands of Samsung and HTC, we hope the parties involved will use this as an opportunity to settle their legal differences once and for all and set up cross-licensing agreements, so they can all compete with their products rather than spend millions of dollars on lawyers. We can all agree that the patent wars within the mobile space have gotten completely out of hand.What do you think will happen if iPhone 5 sales are banned from the US and Europe?Looking for more Android vs Apple news? Did you know that last week it was announced that the Galaxy S III has beat out iPhone 4S as top selling device in US? You do now. Curious how the new iPhone 5 compares to Android? We’ve got that too.

Web browser maker Opera topped the iPhone application download chart within 24 hours of releasing its free browser app.It has been downloaded 1,023,380 times since its launch on 14 April.It took three weeks for Apple to approve the program, which has already been developed for other mobile phone platforms.Opera Mini is not the first alternative to Apple's Safari to be developed for the iPhone.German developer Alexander Clauss launched an iPhone browser application called iCab in May 2009."It is probably the first well known PC browser to become available on the iPhone," said Forrester analyst Ian Fogg."There's no Firefox, no Internet Explorer - and there's not likely to be because of the development environment," he added."An app has to be written especially for a particular phone to offer a high quality experience. On many mobiles the browser provided with the phone is the only choice someone has."Opera has not developed a separate app for the iPad but says the iPhone program will also work on Apple's new device.Chief development officer Christen Krogh told the BBC that Opera's business model is similar to that of a traditional search engine, with revenue coming from affiliate deals and advertising rather than from the user."The web is still a place to make big bucks," he said. "Online ads are lucrative and that's growing on mobiles. The mobile ecosystem is becoming more like the web system."

Google's Motorola division claims Apple is infringing on seven of its patents and wants to block iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers from being imported to the U.S.Since Google’s acquisition of Motorola back in February, the Droid expert has stayed quiet about its previous grievances with Apple. But now, according to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola division has filed a new patent lawsuit against Apple (following Samsung’s lead), opening some old wounds leftover from Motorola and Apple’s long-standing legal disputes. The complaint, submitted to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), names features like location reminders, email notifications, along phone and video players as possible infringements.The complaints target Apple features used extensively in its product line up and given Google’s desire to block U.S. imports of Apple products (Apple manufactures its product line in Asia), a win would strike a major blow. Google seems to have its sights set on Apple destruction. The original patent dispute between Motorola Mobility and Apple was eventually dismissed in court, but Google’s Motorola division isn’t willing to lay it to rest.“We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple’s unwillingness to work out a license leaves us little choice but to defend ourselves and our engineers’ innovations,” wrote Motorola Mobility in an emailed statement.The official document pertaining to this specific case won’t be available until Monday, so we will have to wait until the weekend’s over to learn the full details. The inevitable battle between Apple and Google may be a whole lot closer than we thought. And it’s nice to know we’ll have more legal battles to obsess over since Apple and Samsung’s recent disputes will soon reach a verdict.FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes that an ITC judge already made a preliminary judgement in the previous Motorola vs. Apple case, arguing that Apple did infringe on one of Motorola’s patent. The final ruling in the original case is expected to be released sometime next week. It’s also important to recognize, as Mueller points out, that if Motorola does achieve a ban on Apple products in the previous lawsuit, the iPad 4G and iPhone 4S would be exempt. Both use a Qualcomm chipset falling outside Motorola’s patent claims.For mobile fans, Monday can’t come soon enough. Do you think Google and Motorola stand a chance against Apple?

This story was published in several major Canadian papers today. Atif Shamim, a Carleton engineering student has created an amazing new invention to prolong battery life in iPhones and blackberries. Read all about it.  An Ottawa inventor has pulled off something the titans of innovation behind the iPhone couldn’t — find a way to reduce power consumption of the “power-sucking” device to increase battery life.Atif Shamim, an electronics PhD student at Carleton University, has built a prototype that extends the battery life of portable gadgets such as the iPhone and BlackBerry, by getting rid of all the wires used to connect the electronic circuits with the antenna.Research on the invention, to be published in the upcoming edition of Microwave Journal, has already received international accolades.Last month, the article about the invention, co-authored by Muhammad Arsalan and adviser Langis Roy of Carleton’s department of electronics, was named the best paper at the European Wireless Technology Conference.The invention involves a packaging technique to connect the antenna with the circuits via a wireless connection between a micro-antenna embedded within the circuits on the chip.“This has not been tried before — that the circuits are connected to the antenna wirelessly. They’ve been connected through wires and a bunch of other components. That’s where the power gets lost,” Mr. Shamim said.He estimates his module consumes 12 times less power than the traditional, wired-transmitter module. It is also much simpler in design, lowering the overall cost of any hand-held device, he said.The judges at the European wireless conference lauded Carleton students’ paper for the “excellent integration of system design, material sciences and electromagnetic antenna design.” They also said the innovation is “highly relevant, with large potential for commercialization.”Mr. Shamim has filed patent applications in the U.S. and in Canada, in the knowledge consumers continue to gripe about the short lifespan of the iPhone battery.“It’s a common problem. There are so many applications in the iPhone, it’s like a power-sucking machine,” said Shamim.In June, 2007, Apple tried to answer critics who had given the iPhone low marks for its short battery life. Five months after unveiling the new product, the company announced the iPhone could now get up to eight hours of talk time, up from the five hours of talk time and 16 hours of audio playback at the launch.If an iPhone battery needs repairing, Apple will service it for $89, plus $10.77 for shipping for Canadian customers. All data on the iPhone is lost during the service, which normally takes three business days.Earlier this year, the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation honoured Mr. Shamim and Mr. Arsalan as student researchers of the year for their work in the field of wireless biomedical sensors. Also honoured was University of Ottawa student David Nadeau, for his contribution to the “more intelligent online search engine,” yooname.com

Memo to Samsung (005930): Now this is how you get away with copying Apple (AAPL)! GizChina reports that a Chinese manufacturer has used leaked photos of Apple’s next-generation iPhone to slap together a quick knockoff of the device called the Goophone I5 and release it before Apple has a chance to launch the genuine article later this month. What’s more, the company has actually patented the knockoff design in China and is poised to sue Apple if it launches the next-generation iPhone in China later this year. For any Chinese readers who are interested in buying a not-quite-iPhone, GizChinasays that the Goophone will feature “a Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core 1.4Ghz CPU, 1GB RAM, Android 4.0 ICS with an iOS 6 theme, 8 megapixel rear camera and a 4-inch screen with an impressive retina display resolution of 1280 x 720.”

For the tech world, this has been the summer of patents. Oneto purchase Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion is to grab its 24,000 active and pending patents. This will help Google compete with Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, who recently banded together to buy their own batch of patents. Meanwhile, “patent squatters” who buy patents to extract cash from people who actually make things are suing independent software developers and, in the process, threatening their ability to innovate without fear of litigation.These stories about tech patents don’t just fascinate people who are techies, patent lawyers or clerks at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. When, you know they have attained the status of the Culturally Important.Meanwhile, a notorious filing from Apple has many concerned about what these companies actuallywith their patents. A few months ago, we discovered that Cupertinofor technology that would allow concert promoters to remotely disable concertgoers’ iPhone cameras. “So what?,” you ask.Imagine if police or repressive governments used the same technology to stop citizens from documenting abuses. Want to capture police brutality on your phone? The police could disable your camera and continue their crimes. Want to share scenes from a democratic protest in the Middle East with the rest of the world? Ditto.Cellphone cameras have become ubiquitous, and they’re already indispensable tools for free expression and democratic action. If Apple moves forward with this technology, you can bet anti-democratic forces will be quick to adapt it to their ends.That’s why we at Free Press and SavetheInternet.comfor even proposing such destructive technology.This week, I met up with an Apple representative to hand off the signatures of more than 25,000 activists who urged Apple CEO Steve Jobs to pull the plug on any project that would enable corporate or government censorship.Just for fun, we delivered the signatures in a Macbook Pro box.The Apple representative said he was happy to take these letters up the chain of command. That’s a start. But our members made it clear that such an idea -- even if it’s just one of thousands of patents filed every month -- runs counter to our democratic ideals, and that the public will  hold Apple accountable So as Big Company A fights with Big Company B over expensive patent portfolios, remember that individual patents are often the seeds of real technology that has real consequences. It’s our job to call these patent-hungry companies to task when they overreach.

A new security hole has opened up in Apple Inc.'s iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, raising alarms about the susceptibility of some of the world's hottest tech gadgets to hacker attacks.Flaws in the software running those devices came to light after a German security agency warned that criminals could use them to steal confidential data off the devices. Apple, the world's largest technology company by market value, said Thursday that it is working on a fix that will be distributed in an upcoming software upgrade.With the security hole, an attacker can get malicious software onto a device by tricking its owner into clicking an infected PDF file. Germany's Federal Office for Information Security called the flaws "critical weaknesses" in Apple's iOS operating system.Internet-connected mobile devices are still subject to fewer attacks than personal computer, but they could eventually prove a juicy target for hackers because they are warehouses of confidential banking, e-mail, calendar, contact and other data.Software vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. What makes the latest discovery alarming is that the weaknesses are already being actively exploited - albeit in a consensual way.The latest concerns were prompted by the emergence of a new version of a program to allow Apple devices to run any software and circumvent the restrictions that Apple notoriously retains over software distributed through its online store. There are security risks of doing so, but many people find it liberating to install their own software.Although this program is something people would seek out, the weaknesses that its authors discovered could easily be used for malice, security experts say.There is an irony in the controversy: The site distributing the program offers a fix for the problem, but to get the fix, a user has to first install the program in question. So a user must defy Apple's restrictions to get the protection until Apple comes up with a fix of its own.Charlie Miller, a prominent hacker of Apple products, said it likely took months to develop the program to break Apple's restrictions, but a criminal might need only a day or two to modify it for nefarious purposes.Apple Inc. spokeswoman Bethan Lloyd said Thursday the company is "aware of this reported issue and developing a fix." She would not say when the update will be available.One reason for gadget owners to take heart: Attacks on smartphones and other Internet gadgets are still relatively rare. One reason is PC-based attacks are still highly lucrative. Still, vulnerabilities such as the ones Apple is confronting show that consumers should take care of securing their mobile devices as they would their home computer."These things are computers - they're just small, portable computers that happen to have a phone tacked onto them," said Marc Fossi, manager of research and development for Symantec Security Response. "You've got to treat them more like a computer than a phone. You have to be aware of what's going on with these devices."©2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Another day, another Apple (AAPL) vs. Samsung (005930) trial. The two consumer electronics companies are preparing to do battle in San Jose, California next week, and now-public court documents shed light on the positions each firm is taking. On Tuesday, Apple told Samsung exactly what it thinks its technology patents are worth (spoiler: barely anything at all), and subsequent filings from Samsung reveal that the South Korea-based company has a few choice words for Apple as well.As highlighted by The Wall Street Journal, Samsung’s trial brief pulls no punches in telling the court exactly where it stands regarding Apple’s repeated patent-related accusations. In short, Apple is the thief here, not Samsung. A few key excerpts (emphasis is ours):Samsung has been researching and developing mobile telecommunications technology since at least as early as 1991 and invented much of the technology for today‘s smartphones. Indeed, Apple, which sold its first iPhone nearly twenty years after Samsung started developing mobile phone technology, could not have sold a single iPhone without the benefit of Samsung‘s patented technology.For good measure, Apple seeks to exclude Samsung from the market, based on its complaints that Samsung has used the very same public domain design concepts that Apple borrowed from other competitors, including Sony, to develop the iPhone. Apple‘s own internal documents show this. In February 2006, before the claimed iPhone design was conceived of, Apple executive Tony Fadell circulated a news article that contained an interview of a Sony designer to Steve Jobs, Jonathan Ive and others. In the article, the Sony designer discussed Sony portable electronic device designs that lacked “excessive ornamentation” such as buttons, fit in the hand, were “square with a screen” and had “corners [which] have been rounded out.”Contrary to the image it has cultivated in the popular press, Apple has admitted in internal documents that its strength is not in developing new technologies first, but in successfully commercializing them. . . . Also contrary to Apple‘s accusations, Samsung does not need or want to copy; rather, it strives to best the competition by developing multiple, unique products. Samsung internal documents from 2006, well before the iPhone was announced, show rectangular phones with rounded corners, large displays, flat front faces, and graphic interfaces with icons with grid layouts.Apple relied heavily on Samsung‘s technology to enter the telecommunications space, and it continues to use Samsung‘s technology to this day in its iPhone and iPad products. For example, Samsung supplies the flash memory, main memory, and application processor for the iPhone. . . .  But Apple also uses patented Samsung technology that it has not paid for. This includes standards-essential technology required for Apple‘s products to interact with products from other manufacturers, and several device features that Samsung developed for use in its products.It’s clear that we’re in for yet another action-packed adventure when the trial kicks off next week.

What's wrong with making the batteries bigger? The iphone, for instance, is already .37 inches wide. What's wrong with rounding up and making it .5 inches and fitting a bigger battery inside? Evo 4G has shitty battery life already, it's already as big as a brick, what is another .25 inches for the thickness? What about laptops these days. Even with dim use and most settings turned off, typing and listening to music won't get you more then 4-8 hours. All these manufacturers are saying "hey look, our gadget can go 7 hours without a charge" then it get's the consumer and those 7 hours are only with every possible setting turned off and lowest light settings as well. Why not make my laptop 1/2"-1" wider and fucking stuff a bigger battery inside? I don't give a fuck about how tiny your product is anymore. If the battery life sucks, FUCK YOU.

The patent brawl between Samsung and Apple marches on. Samsung on Tuesday filed amendment documents requesting to add the iPhone 5 to its existing suit against the Cupertino company.Samsung accuses Apple’s latest smartphone of infringing eight of its patents, the same ones it claims Apple’s new iPad, iPad 2, iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, and iPod touch also infringe. In its filing, Samsung states, “The iPhone 5 has the same accused functionality as the previously accused versions of the iPhone, so the proof of infringement of the patents-in-suit by the iPhone 5 is the same as for other Apple devices already accused of infringement in this litigation.”To justify adding the iPhone 5 to the previous filing, Samsung states in its amendment that it “could not have known whether the rumored iPhone 5 would practice its patented technologies when it filed its infringement contentions on June 15. The product was not on the market at that time and could not have been included in the contentions.”Nonetheless, Samsung had already threatened to sue Apple over the iPhone 5 this month. And earlier reports indicated that Samsung had planned to add the iPhone 5 to its list of infringing Apple devices once it confirmed that the smartphone had 4G LTE capability.The news comes just over month after a U.S. jury found Samsung guilty of violating many of Apple’s design patents. The jury decided Samsung owed Apple close to $1.05 billion in damages.

A TV ad for Apple's iPhone has been banned by the UK's advertising watchdog for misleading consumers after it over-hyped the internet capabilities of the smart phone.The ad showed the internet navigation prowess of the iPhone, with images zooming in on a weather forecast for Cape Town and a map of how to get to Heathrow airport."You never know which part of the internet you'll need ... which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iPhone," ran a voiceover.The Advertising Standards Authority received two complaints that the claim was misleading because the iPhone did not support Flash or Java, which are both integral to many web pages.Apple said the aim of the ad was to highlight how the iPhone can offer access to all websites, while many other handsets only offer lower-level access to WAP versions of sites or those selected by service providers.The US technology giant said that Safari, the web browser the iPhone uses, was built to open internet standards.Flash and Java technology were not open source, said Apple, adding that it could not ensure compatibility with "every third-party technology in the marketplace".The company said none of the content in the ad was Java or Flash-based and that the line "all parts of the internet" meant website availability, "not every aspect of functionality".Advertising pre-vetting service Clearcast said the ad had been given the green light for broadcast after a "demonstration and the advertiser's assurances".However, the Advertising Standards Authority said that claims made by Apple implied that "users would be able to access all websites and see them in their entirety".Because the ad had not explained the limitations of the iPhone, the ASA concluded that "the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iPhone".The ASA ordered that the TV ad must not be broadcast again in the same form.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

China Labor Watch is reporting that another Foxconn strike broke out on Friday at the Zhengzhou factory in China. The report says 3,000 to 4,000 Foxconn (2038) are complaining about Apple’s (AAPL) demanding quality standards for the iPhone 5. China Labor Watch further reports that workers are under immense pressure to deliver iPhone 5?s without receiving adequate training on how to improve yield rates.“It was reported that factory management and Apple, despite design defects, raised strict quality demands on workers, including indentations standards of 0.02mm and demands related to scratches on frames and back covers,” notes China Labor Watch. “With such demands, employees could not even turn out iPhones that met the standard.”iPhone 5 production lines are currently “in a state of paralysis for the entire day.” A brawl between production line workers and quality control inspectors also resulted in the latter getting beaten up. Factory management is reportedly “turning their back on the issue.” China Labor Watch’s press release follows below.UPDATE: Foxconn has issued a statement that no strikes occurred on Friday. It did acknowledge two disputes, but claims they were immediately addressed.(New York) China Labor Watch (CLW) announced that at 1:00PM on October 5 (Beijing time), a strike occurred at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory that, according to workers, involved three to four thousand production workers. In addition to demanding that workers work during the holiday, Foxconn raised overly strict demands on product quality without providing worker training for the corresponding skills. This led to workers turning out products that did not meet standards and ultimately put a tremendous amount of pressure on workers. Additionally, quality control inspectors fell into to conflicts with workers and were beat up multiple times by workers. Factory management turned a deaf ear to complaints about these conflicts and took no corrective measures. The result of both of these circumstances was a widespread work stoppage on the factory floor among workers and inspectors. The majority of workers who participated in this strike were workers from the OQC (onsite quality control) line. According to workers, multiple iPhone 5 production lines from various factory buildings were in a state of paralysis for the entire day.  It was reported that factory management and Apple, despite design defects, raised strict quality demands on workers, including indentations standards of 0.02mm and demands related to scratches on frames and back covers. With such demands, employees could not even turn out iPhones that met the standard. This led to a tremendous amount of pressure on workers. On top of this, they were not permitted to have a vacation during the holiday. This combination of factors led to the strike. That quality control inspectors would also strike is of no surprise. According to workers, there was a fight between workers and quality control inspectors in area K that led to the damage in inspection room CA, the injury of some people, and the hospitalization of others. After this, another similar incident occurred in area K, once again leading to quality control inspectors getting beat up. Yesterday, inspectors in area L received physical threats. When inspectors reported these issues to factory management, the management simply ignored and turned their back on the issue. For these reasons, all day and night shift inspectors carried out a work stoppage today that paralyzed the production lines. CLW Executive Director Li Qiang said, “This strike is a result of the fact that these workers just have too much pressure.” Founded in 2000, China Labor Watch is an independent not-for-profit organization. In the past ten years, CLW has collaborated with labor organizations and the media to conduct a series of in-depth assessments of factories in China that produce toys, bikes, shoes, furniture, clothing, and electronics for some of the largest companies. CLW’s New York office creates reports from these investigations, educates the international community on supply chain labor issues, and pressures corporations to improve conditions for workers.

If you can’t be bothered to wait for the iPhone 5, then how about this?A German engineer has created a 10 times scale version of the iPhone 4 with a 40 inch screen which offers iPhone-esque computer functions - but also doubles up as a table.The ‘iTableous’ has exactly the same design as the Apple mobile right down to the on and off buttons, the camera and the accelerometer.It is covered by 8mm strong plexiglass and can flip onto its side to make using it more easy.But before you start placing your order, be aware that the iTableous isn't quite as hi-tech as it might appear. It does not have a touchscreen and can’t even be used to make phone calls.Its creator Benjamin Bachmeier has admitted that it functions more like a desktop computer, although it can connect to the Internet via wireless 3G.The iTableous is 118cm long and 58.9cm wide, around 10 times larger than the iPhone 4, which is 11.5cm long and 5.8cm wide.It uses a 40inch 920 x 1080 Toyota LCD monitor instead of a touch screen - so while you can't control it with a finger-swipe, it is at least satisfyingly large.Users operate the computer using a keyboard and a mouse sitting on or next to the screen.Just like a real iPhone the speakers are at the bottom of the case, only these ones are powered with a subwoofer, two mid range tweeters and two other speakers.The Home button does not work but lifts up to hide a 30-pin connector - so you can connect devices, including, oddly, a real iPhone.The iTableous runs off Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6.7 and has a 500GB hard disk and 4GB of RAM being powered by a GHz Zotac Ionitx processor.At the top just where the camera should be Mr Bachmeier has installed a 5.7-megapixel HD camera right which allows video conferencing when connected to the Internet.He has also converted what is normally the sleep button to a giant power switch.Other parts include a flap which appears to be a giant SIM card cover, but actually opens up to let you look at the circuitry inside.The connections include a line-in port, one USB 2.0 port as per an Apple computer, a SuperDrive, two HDMI ports and a DVB-T antenna cable.The swinging function flips the entire device 90 degrees on its side so the user can sit on the floor whilst using it.The other alterations include four internal fans plus an additional one Mr Bachmeier has fashioned himself to reduce the noise of the computer.

Oh, Nick Lee, you clever boy you. See, Nick here tricked Apple with a very simple iPhone application: Handy Light. On the surface it looked just like any other $0.99 flashlight application. But, secretly, it was a lot more useful.Handy Light allowed you to make your iPhone's screen go blank with a color of your choice. You opened it, clicked a swatch from a simple palette, and that was it: Life in technicolor. Another stupid flashlight application like a hundred others. Or so the App Store team thought.Inside, the app contained hidden code that made it a full tethering application—a program that allows you to use your iPhone as a 3G modem. Using this ability you can surf the web from your computer, using the iPhone as a bridge to the internet. You can do this using your iPhone's preferences too, but that way you will have to pay the additional $20 per month that AT&T wants you to pay for this kind of service.

Somewhere around 95 percent of iPhone users who download an application from Apple's App Store stop using it after less than a month. Are iPhone apps just not that compelling?Just 30 percent of people who buy an iPhone application actually use it the day after it was purchased, according to Pinch Media, which analyzed over 30 million downloads from Apple's App Store. And the numbers plunge from there: after 20 days, less than 5 percent of those who downloaded an application are actively using it. The drop-off is worse for free applications.Those are amazing numbers. It's not a new pattern--GigaOm and TechCrunch noticed this last August--but back then, with the App Store just a month old, it was hard to know whether that usage model would last.Now it's clear that seven months, 15,000 applications, and 500 million downloads later, things haven't changed. App Store activity continues to be huge; Apple has made the App Store the centerpiece of its iPhone marketing over the last few months, highlighting the breadth and depth of applications that are available on the App Store for business and entertainment.But if most people don't find iPhone applications very compelling, does it matter how many exist? It's enough to wonder if the App Store is starting to get a bit saturated.Pinch Media CEO Greg Yardley looks at it a little differently. In his view, Apple has built such an easy-to-use distribution (as well as payment processing) platform for iPhone applications that people find it very easy to move onto the next thing that catches their fancy. The lack of a "try-before-you-buy" feature means iPhone users have no choice but to take the plunge, and given that most iPhone applications are free and the ones that do cost money are very inexpensive, there's little incentive to carefully shop around for the one application that best meets your needs.Only about 10 percent of iPhone applications appear to retain an audience over time, and most of those are games, entertainment applications such as movie listings, and things like Facebook ("their user sessions must be off the charts," Yardley said).But developers are still making plenty of money from the other 90 percent, he said. As noted, people are very willing to try new iPhone applications, meaning that building a better mousetrap is still a very viable business model for the world of mobile computing. His advice for developers is to get your money up front, and charge something for your application rather than trying to depend on a free/ad-subsidized model, because the number of people viewing those ads will plummet the day after the application lands on their iPhones.At some point, however, Apple will need to find a better way to help developers promote their applications within an ocean. "The App Store fails as a promotional mechanism. There's only so much screen real estate" that Apple can use within the App Store window to promote applications, Yardley said, and if you don't get on those Top 100 or Staff Favorites lists, your application languishes.Yardley thinks there is still a great deal of opportunity for developers on the App Store, which isn't that surprising given he makes his living by advising iPhone developers. And it's true that if the installed base of iPhones continues to grow, there will be more and more niche opportunities to cater to the needs of high-school students and seniors, and everyone in between.Still, how many more currency conversion (37), recipe (67), and fart-joke (30) applications do iPhone users really need, especially if they aren't using the ones they've already got?

Court in Seoul rules that both technology giants infringed on each other's patents in battle for smartphone supremacy.Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple in Seoul in April last year regarding infringement of patents [Reuters]Apple and Samsung have been banned from selling some of their products in South Korea, after a court ruled that they both infringed on each other's patents on mobile devices. The court ruling on Friday comes as the two firms are locked in a bitter patent battle that could determine their fight for supremacy in the global smartphone market. The Seoul Central District Court ordered Apple to remove the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad 1 and iPad 2 from store shelves in South Korea, ruling that the products infringed on two of Samsung's telecommunications patents. The court also ruled that Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung had infringed on one of Apple's patents related to the screen's bounce-back ability and banned sales of the Galaxy S2 and other products in South Korea. Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple in Seoul in April last year regarding infringement of patents related to telecommunications standards. Apple responded in June by filing a counter suit claiming Samsung copied the design and user interface of its iPhone and iPad. The split ruling is not expected to make any impact on the broader dispute which involves legal action in several nations including the US and Australia. The South Korean decision comes ahead of a high-stakes US jury verdict that is expected to signal the future course of the rival firms' tussle for smartphone supremacy. In the US court, Apple is seeking more than $2.5bn after accusing the Korean firm of infringing designs and other patents. Samsung says Apple infringed its patents for wireless communication. It is one of several legal cases around the world involving the two electronics giants in the hottest part of the tech sector - tablet computers and smartphones. While the results so far have been mixed in courts in Europe and Australia, Samsung has a lot at stake in the US case, which could result in large damages or injunctions against its products in the American market. A recent survey by research firm IDC showed Samsung extended its lead over Apple in the smartphone market in the second quarter despite slowing demand for mobile phones. Samsung shipped 50.2 million smartphones globally in the April-June period, while Apple sold 26 million iPhones. IDC said Samsung held 32.6 per cent of the market to 16.9 per cent for Apple. Samsung has steadfastly denied abusing Apple patents and countered in court that Apple has been taking advantage of some of the South Korean company's patented technology for wireless connections. The battle is all the more complex as Apple and Samsung are not only competitors in the fast-growing global market for smartphones and tablet computers, but also have a close business relationship. Samsung, the world's biggest manufacturer of memory chips and liquid crystal displays, supplies some of the key components that go into Apple products.

So word on the street (literally) is that a large number of people are queuing in line outside of Apple's flagship store on 5th Avenue in New York City (see above) -- keep in mind the Cube is open 24 hours a day. Our intrepid girl-on-the-scene reports that the group is more than 60-deep, though most people seem confused about what they're waiting for, while some believe they're actually camping out for a 3G iPhone. Meanwhile, Apple reps tell us they're crowd-controlling iPhone buyers because otherwise they would be "screaming" at employees and clogging up the store. See what happens when you get short on stock? More pics after the break. For those of you convinced this is an Improv Everywhere stunt, here's a post from Charlie Todd -- the group's founder -- denying involvement.[Thanks, Laura and Abiade]

A 25-year-old Best Buy employee who posted a snarky cartoon spoof of iPhone zealots online has been suspended and may soon be out of a job.Brian Maupin, who worked at a Best Buy branch in Independence, Mo., since 2007, was suspended from his job Thursday, according to the Associated Press, and now expects to be fired by Monday for posting the two YouTube videos that slam fans of the iPhone 4 and HTC Evo 4G. Those videos don't mention Best Buy, which sells both phones.The AP quoted an e-mail from Best Buy spokesman Justin Barber, who said Friday that the consumer electronics chain was still deciding how to proceed with Maupin, whom he called an "aspiring filmmaker."Although Maupin's bosses failed to see the humor in the videos, a lot of other people have, apparently. At last look, more than 1.7 million people have viewed the iPhone video on YouTube. It features a 3.28-minute conversation between an increasingly exasperated electronics store salesman trying to talk a shopper into considering a smartphone other than the Apple smartphone. The video targeting Evo buyers (following the jump) had racked up more than 357,000 views."They felt it disparaged a brand they carried (iPhone/Apple) as well as the store itself and were fearful of stockholders and customers being turned off to Best Buy Mobile," Maupin said in an interview with TechCrunch.Maupin told TechCrunch he was asked to quit but refused the request. At that point, Maupin says he was told of his suspension in advance of a review of the matter by the company's human resources department. "I issued a statement to them explaining that the video was intended to be comedic and hence, not taken seriously by them or all these stockholders and customers they are worried about [being] turned off to buying from them due to the video,' Maupin said.(Reader advisory: the language in the videos gets a bit spicy in parts.)

Apple, never one to tolerate much controversial content in its precious app store, has joined the long list of companies cutting ties with WikiLeaks. An application that offered iPhone users access to WikiLeaks’ daily trickle of formerly-secret diplomatic cables has been removed from the app store with little explanation, as TechCrunch first reported.Igor Barinov, the developer of the app, confirmed to TechCrunch that his $1.99 program had been pulled from the store, though whether that banishment was due to WikiLeaks’ political controversy or some other element of the app still isn’t clear. I’ve contacted the company for comment and will update if I hear back from them.Update: Trudy Muller, an Apple spokesperson, says that Apple  “removed the Wikileaks App from the App Store because it violated our developer guidelines. Apps must comply with all local laws and may not put an individual or targeted group in harms way.”You can still see a cached version of the banned app here.Android, meanwhile, continues to allow half a dozen apps that offer access to WikiLeaks’ content, some for free. I’ve written to Google to ask whether it plans to take any action to block those apps. If it does, it can expect a serious backlash from users who expect a more liberal approach to their content and will no doubt cry foul over any censorship.It’s no surprise that Apple, with its restrictive policies on content, wouldn’t tolerate the hosting of content that the U.S. government has declared stolen goods. Amazon Web Services, a far more tolerant platform, exiled WikiLeaks from its data centers two weeks ago, and financial firms have moved to choke the company too, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and most recently, Bank of America.The ability to scroll on your phone through thousands of raw cables written in stuffy diplomatic language is hardly a privilege most users will miss–after all, they can still access the Guardian and the New York Times apps, where the same information is being parsed and delivered in a much more consumable form. But WikiLeaks will serve as a free speech litmus test for every company in its orbit. And it’s already shown just how little the likes of Apple and Amazon care about users’ access to information.

Who says you can’t use your iPhone like a laptop? Per the Telegraph, a computer science student in the United Kingdom has used the iPhone’s built-in accelerometer to measure vibrations that are then programmed to correspond with keys on a “virtual keyboard.” So for instance, if you put your iPhone down on a table and tap from a close distance, it will register as one letter while tapping further away will register as a different letter. As the Telegraph notes,this virtual keyboard right now gets the correct letters just 80% of the time, which is something that creator Florian Kraeutli says won’t be improved without a stronger accelerometer. Kraeutli also describes the virtual keyboard as more of a “proof of concept” than a commercially viable invention. A video demonstration of the iPhone keyboard is posted below.

A pair of workers who claim to have been poisoned by toxins in a Suzhou, China factory while assembling touchscreens for Apple’s iPhone have written an open letter begging consumers to demand reform. SumOfUs, the organization behind the Ethical iPhone Campaign, released the letter in an email to the media on Wednesday afternoon. The letter was written by Guo Rui-qiang and Jia Jing-chuan, two former factory workers who urge consumers to sign SumOfUs’s petition and demand that Apple force its suppliers and manufacturing partners to improve working conditions at their Chinese factories. Both workers claim to have been poisoned by a chemical cleaner called N-hexane, and they have suffered neurological damage as a result. The Fair Labor Association is currently conduction inspections of two Foxconn factories, prompted by Apple, and while only preliminary inspections have been made at this point, the organization says it has already found “tons of issues.” The workers’ letter follows below in its entirety.You don’t know us but you have seen our work. Until recently, we worked long hours assembling Apple’s iPhone touch screens in Suzhou, China.In early 2010, it was independently confirmed that 137 workers, including us, were poisoned by a chemical called n-hexane which was used to clean iPhone screens. N-hexane is known to cause eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and leads to persistant nerve damage. Apple admitted to gross labour rights violations more than a year later.If more people know about what we went through, Apple will feel pressured to change so other workers don’t have to suffer like we did.Can you share this letter with your friends, and ask them to join you in signing our petition calling for a reform of working conditions at their factories?We have been pressuring Apple, and its new CEO Tim Cook, for years to compensate those of us who were injured working for them, and demanding reform of working conditions at their Chinese factories so that their workers don’t suffer like we do. Now we need your help as customers or potential customers of Apple.We need your help to send a message to Apple before their shareholder meeting on Thursday, Feb. 23rd. We want to see a strict corporate social responsibility and reform of the audit system to prevent similar tragedies in the future. He will listen to you as current or potential consumers.You’ve already signed the petition, and 82,000 others have too — for that, we thank you. We believe it’d be symbolicly powerful if 100,000 people signed the petition before SumOfUs delivers it to Tim Cook on Thursday at their shareholder meeting. We’re really close to that goal, but we need you to share our request with your friends to get over the edge.Can you share our letter with your friends, and ask them to sign the petition too?It has been over two years since many of us were hospitalized and treated but our debilitating symptoms continue. Rui-Qiang still can’t find work because he can no longer stand for the long hours most jobs require. Jing-Chuan has to spend nearly $100 a month on health supplements.But with all of us working together to pressure Apple to change, we can make sure what happened to us doesn’t happen to others too.

Back in my day, piracy and filesharing was sketchy as hell. You would have to dig around on sites that very clearly compromised your security, you had considerably fewer choices in what to download, and cracking software was considerably more difficult. To the point, at least, where someone with less-than average computer skills would not even attempt to crack it, or would get their computer messed up.I remember a time when cracking your gadgets was difficult. Yes you followed instructions from the internet, but there was always a chance it would work and you would break your system. This kept a lot of people from doing it.Now, I have no problem with piracy when it's piracy, but honestly it isn't piracy anymore. It has become sterile and bland. Piracy was named piracy because back in the day, it was like being a pirate! Back then you were a swashbuckling, risk-taking corsair who lived on the edge. It wasn't only getting you the files you want for free, it was god damn exciting. But what has it degraded to? Now everyone has become a pirate. It is the norm. Because everyone is a pirate, pirating has become easier. Have you looked at instructions to "jailbreak" your iphone recently? It's basically one button. And downloading cracked software for that same iphone? I witnessed someone open a professional-looking iphone menu on their cracked phone, and download a brand new game (wich should have costed some money) absolutely free. No hassle, no workarounds, just touch to install. I was disgusted. Piracy should only be accessible to pirates. Your computer illiterate grandmother should not be able to download and crack photoshop. 10 year olds shouldn't be able to jailbreak their iphones and illegally download games people worked hard to make, before they're even old enough to realize what they're doing.Bring piracy back to what it was, something naturally somewhat difficult and slightly risky. Because not everyone should be a pirate. Yar.Edit: Added linebreaks to my "Whining spiel", just for you Paranoir

Over the last two weeks countless blog posts and articles have been written about the Gizmodo/iPhone leak and the subsequent police investigation. Few have been as scathing toward Apple as a segment that aired on tonight’s Daily Show. And while Apple has long made a habit of mostly ignoring what the press and media says about it, you can be sure this will get their attention.In the segment, host Jon Stewart lambasts Apple for the police raid on Gizmodo editor Jason Chen’s house, and the fact that Apple employees showed up on the doorstep of the guy who originally found the phone. Stewart’s report glosses over some important points in the case and gets a few details wrong. But ultimately that doesn’t really matter — Stewart’s audience probably doesn’t care if there’s a chance a crime was committed here. To them, a guy found a phone in the bar, photos of it were posted on the Internet, and Apple responded by siccing the authorities on them.The segment is full of great quotes, like:“You guys are busting down doors in Palo Alto while Commandant Gates is ridding the world of mosquitoes. What the f**k is going on?” “Apple you guys were the rebels man, the underdogs. People believed in you. But now, are you becoming The Man? Remember back in 1984, you had those awesome ads about overthrowing Big Brother? Look in the mirror, man!” “If you want to break down someone’s door, why don’t you start with AT&T, for God sakes? They make your amazing phone unusable as a phone!”But the most important, at least from Apple’s perspective, is this one:And that right there is why Apple will probably be paying more attention to this than it did to myriad blog posts about the iPhone leak. Apple can often afford to ignore outraged tech bloggers and developers because its mainstream audience really doesn’t care about its inconsistent App Store policies or section 3.3.1 of the iPhone developer agreement. But the mainstream most definitely cares what Jon Stewart has to say, and I suspect the demographic watching this show plays a big part in making Apple’s laptops, iPhones, and iPods hits.And if Stewart is tearing into them now, imagine what will happen if Gizmodo, Chen, and the unnamed iPhone finder get charged with crimes.

In the wake of Apple's decision to relax restrictions on the tools its developers can use, Adobe announced Friday that it would resume development on Flash for the iPhone.Adobe "will now resume development work" on its Packager for iPhone for future releases, Adobe wrote in a blog post. The feature is part of the Flash Professional CS5 authoring tool.In April, Adobe announced that it would no longer invest in iPhone-based Flash development after Apple banned private APIs and required apps to be written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine."Essentially, this has the effect of restricting applications built with a number of technologies, including Unity, Titanium, MonoTouch, and Flash CS5," Adobe principal product manager Mike Chambers said at the time. "While it appears that Apple may selectively enforce the terms, it is our belief that Apple will enforce those terms as they apply to content created with Flash CS5."On Thursday, however, Apple reversed course and said it would relax all restrictions on the development tools used to create iOS apps, as long as the resulting apps did not download any code."This is great news for developers and we're hearing from our developer community that Packager apps are already being approved for the App Store," Adobe said. "We do want to point out that Apple's restriction on Flash content running in the browser on iOS devices remains in place."Apple and Adobe have not exactly been on the best of terms lately. They got into a very public spat earlier this year when Apple CEO Steve Jobs posted a note on the Apple Web site that said Apple products would not include support for Flash because the technology is closed, unstable, and antiquated. Adobe responded by saying it would focus its attention on Android apps.Adobe reiterated its commitment to other platforms Friday."Adobe will continue to work to bring full web browsing with Flash Player 10.1 as well as standalone applications on AIR to a broad range of devices, working with key industry partners including Google, HTC, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, Palm/HP, RIM, Samsung and others," the company said.

When Apple VP Phil Schiller took the stage on September 12th to talk about the company’s new iPhone 5 hardware he went on at length about the exacting level of precision that goes into its manufacture. But despite Apple's insistence that its tolerances are measured in microns, several iPhone 5 owners are reporting that their new devices are arriving with a variety of scuffs and scrapes out of the box (myself included, pictured above).The anodized aluminum seems to scratch more easily than the stainless steel in the 4SThe company’s record-breaking sales numbers certainly don’t make it easy to guess at how widespread the issue is, but an informal poll in the MacRumors forums indicates that out of some 1260 respondents, more than a third are reporting some kind of damage. The source of the scuffs (pictured below) is anyone’s guess, but as All Things D points out, the iPhone 5’s case is made out of anodized (i.e., coated) aluminum, which, while being lighter than the stainless steel used in the iPhone 4 and 4S, is also softer and appears to be more susceptible to scratching. It's worth noting that HTC used a comparable oxidized finishfor its One S handset — a phone whose users reported having similar cosmetic issues.So far, Apple hasn't commented on the issue, but if you’re one of the unlucky buyers stuck with a scratched phone (and you’re not into the whole "worn in" look), it may be worth taking your device in to a local Apple Store and asking for an exchange. And if you haven't yet picked yours up, we'd suggest giving it a thorough look-over in the store before heading home with your new phone.

I'm currently with sprint for cell phone service, and have been pretty happy all things considered. It's about time for me to renew, and I'm pretty annoyed by their new $10 premium data charge.I was thinking about going with AT&T, and getting an iPhone with no text messaging plan, although I do text quite a bit. With the included minutes and data package, it would be $48.99/month (this is factoring in a discount of approximately 15% through my work).My thinking was that I could simply start using my Google Voice number as my primary number, and pretty much stop using my current cell number entirely, so as to have free texting. I just started thinking of this today, and was just wondering if anyone had any experience with this or any input as to why this would or would not work.Thanks, I really appreciate any and all input!

     SAN FRANCISCO (CN) - AT&T Mobility faces another federal class action involving its iPhone and iPad services. This one claims that "AT&T's bills systematically overstate the amount of data used on each data transaction involving an iPhone or iPad account," and bills customers for data transactions even if they disable their phones and leave them untouched - as the plaintiff's experts did.      The class says AT&T's billing system "is like a rigged gas tank that charges pump that charges for a full gallon when it pumps only nine-tenths of a gallon into your car's tank."     AT&T has faced a welter of class actions since rolling out its iPhone service with Apple, which is not named as a party to this complaint. Previous class actions have claimed AT&T charged for downloads its customers never made, reneged on its billing plans for iPhones, charged for services it could not or did not deliver, and promised but failed that the phones could send text messages and photos.     In the new complaint, named plaintiff Patrick Hendricks claims that AT&T's overbilling "was discovered by an independent consulting firm retained by plaintiff's counsel, which conducted a two-month study of AT&T's billion practices for data usage, and found that AT&T systematically overstate web server traffic by 7 percent to 14 percent, and in some instances by over 300 percent. So, for example, if an iPhone user downloads a 50 KB website, AT&T's bill would typically overstated the traffic as 53.5 KB (a 7 percent overcharge) to as high as 150 KB (a 300 percent overcharge)." (Parentheses in complaint.)     But wait, Hendrick's claim continues: "It gets worse. Not only does AT&T systematically overbill for every data transaction, it also bills for phantom data traffic when there is no actual data usage initiated by the customer. This was discovered by the same independent consulting firm, which purchased an iPhone from an AT&T store, immediately disabled all push notifications and location services, confirmed that no email account was configured on the phone, closed all applications, and let the phone sit untouched for 10 days. During this 10-day period, AT&T billed the test account for 35 data transactions totaling 2,292 KB of usage. This is like the rigged gas pump charging you when you never even pulled your car into the station."     The class claims that though AT&T's overcharges "have a modest effect on an individual customer's bill, they have a huge effect on AT&T's bottom line. AT&T has 92,8 million customers. In the fourth quarter of 2010, AT&T reported its wireless data revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 27.4 percent, from the year-earlier quarter, to $4.9 billion. A significant portion of those data revenues were inflated by AT&T's rigged billing system for data transactions."     Hendricks seeks restitution and class damages for money had and received, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, unfair and fraudulent business practices, unfair competition, and violations of the federal Communications Act. He is represented by L. Timothy Fisher with Bursor & Fisher of Walnut Creek.

And the plot thickens. According to a report out of Korea Times, Samsung has confirmed that if Apple releases an LTE-enabled iPhone next month, the Korean electronics giant will slap them with a lawsuit immediately here in the States. Taken from analysis over at iRunway, Samsung currently holds 10% of all LTE patents granted so far and has waited for Apple to release an LTE iPhone for just this reason – deciding not to go after Apple’s less popular LTE-enabled iPad device. The “hit them where it hurts” approach. As many would expect, there is no way Apple isn’t going to release an LTE iPhone this year. It’s simply become the standard that consumers look for when purchasing a new smartphone. Plus let’s face it, if Apple doesn’t release LTE on the next iPhone, then they will have basically screwed themselves anyways.So, will Apple release the device and then gather their legal team once more for another showdown? With unveiling of the iPhone 5 in a matter of weeks, we shall see soon enough.

I called AT&T's retention department today because paying 120 a month when I only use about 2mb of data on my iphone and half my 1,500 minutes a month seemed pretty high. But I ended asking about keeping my unlimited plan if I upgraded to the iphone 4 and if I could tether it. Surprisingly I could! Then she did some research and found out I could if I paid 30 extra a month with a 5 gig cap on the tethering. So my bill would be 150 for for my phone and internet that at best is on a highly reliable network. Sprint's HTC Evo 4 with 69 a month unlimited +10 for 4g is looking pretty fucking awesome right now... and I can tether for a one time fee of 10 bucks, just for the app. AT&T and their Iphone are priced so far out of the market place that I cannot see myself being an AT&T/Iphone user for much longer.tl;dr: Fuck the Iphone 4, 150 a month to tether vs. the HTC evo 4 @ 79 unlimited plan plus a 10 flat fee for tethering.

Eight iPhone owners have joined an elite clan: Their Apple gadget is running a program that cost nearly $1,000.When the iPhone first hit the market in June 2007, those who paid the $499 entry price -- and signed the two-year AT&T contract -- owned a status symbol. A year later, we have the iPhone 3G, Apple's speedier, sleeker and, most important, less expensive smart phone, which introduced a section for downloading third-party applications. Now that the phone is affordable enough for a wider audience, a new status symbol has emerged: a seemingly useless application called I Am Rich.Its function is exactly what the name implies: to alert people that you have money in the bank. I Am Rich was available for purchase from the phone's App Store for, get this, $999.99 -- the highest amount a developer can charge through the digital retailer, said Armin Heinrich, the program's developer. Once downloaded, it doesn't do much -- a red icon sits on the iPhone home screen like any other application, with the subtext "I Am Rich." Once activated, it treats the user to a large, glowing gem (pictured above). That's about it. For a thousand dollars.Apple apparently had some problems with I Am Rich. After initially approving it for distribution, the company has since removed it from the store. Heinrich, a German software developer, has yet to hear back from Apple concerning the removal. "I have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the App Store," Heinrich said in an e-mail with The Times today.But Apple couldn't pull it down before curious aristocrats -- eight of them -- had purchased it. Six people from the United States, one from Germany and one from France dropped a grand for the gem in the first 24 hours it was available, Heinrich said. That's $5,600 in revenue for Heinrich and $2,400 for Apple, which collects 30% of each sale for "store upkeep."In the e-mail, Heinrich said there seemed to be a market for the program. "I am sure a lot more people would like to buy it -- but currently can't do so," Heinrich said. "The App is a work of Art and included a 'secret mantra' -- that's all."A possible explanation for its removal: A screen shot of an App Store review that has been circulating around the Web recently, showing a user's complaint that he purchased it accidentally. "I saw this app with a few friends and we jokingly clicked 'buy' thinking it was a joke, to see what would happen. ... THIS IS NO JOKE...DO NOT BUY THIS APP AND APPLE PLEASE REMOVE THIS FROM THE APP STORE," it read.I Am Rich isn't the first software that has been removed from Apple's store. Box Office, a movie showtime resource, and NetShare, which let users connect a computer to the Internet using the iPhone's 3G wireless data service, disappeared without a trace. Apple did not respond to phone calls for comment.UPDATED: In a follow-up e-mail, Heinrich said he had not yet received his $5,600 check from Apple, which has a policy of paying developers at the end of each calendar month. He's unsure how the app's removal will affect the payment process."I've got e-mails from customers telling me that they really love the app," adding that they had "no trouble spending the money," he said.UPDATED: Heinrich confirms the validity of the review pictured in the screenshot, and Apple has refunded his and another buyer's money. "I don't want to collect money from people who did this by accident and I am glad that Apple returned the money for two orders," Heinrich said.Milian is an intern at latimes.com.

Dear iPhone 4 Users, The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in Apple's history. It has been judged by reviewers around the world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them. Here is what we have learned. To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design. At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our own experience and testing. What can explain all of this? We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising. Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display 4 bars when we should be displaying as few as 2 bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place. To fix this, we are adopting AT&T's recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the iPhone's bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a given area. We are also making bars 1, 2 and 3 a bit taller so they will be easier to see. We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been present since the original iPhone, this software update will also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G. We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same- the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused. As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund. We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do. Thank you for your patience and support. Apple

A Pennsylvania man has sued Apple for not doing enough to prevent children from running up huge in-app purchase bills in iPhone, iPad games.Shortly after Apple introduced new parental controls for in-app purchases on iPhone or iPad games, the company is being slapped with a lawsuit that says it hasn't done enough.Earlier this week, Garen Meguerian of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against Apple that says the company's policy for in-app purchases doesn't go far enough to prevent children from buying currency or points inside apps and games. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, requests class-action status and asks for unspecified damages and legal fees.Meguerian brought the suit after his 9-year-old daughter downloaded the free iOS games Zombie Cafe, Treasure Story, and City Story, and then proceeded to buy virtual currency within the games, which ended up costing Meguerian $200, according to the complaint."These games are highly addictive, designed deliberately so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $100 purchase or more," the lawsuit reads.The complaint notes that Apple requires a password in order to purchase anything from the App Store, and also acknowledges that Apple recently added the requirement via an iOS updatethat a password be entered before making purchases inside any app. The suit finds fault with the fact that the password required for both scenarios is the same.The Associated Press wrote last December about parents having to pay massive bills generated by their children buying items within games or apps without a clear understanding that they cost real money.Then the Federal Trade Commission got involved, with Chairman John Leibowitz sending a letter to Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) confirming that he would review the way Apple marketed in-app purchases, in particular apps aimed at children.Apple responded shortly thereafter with new parental controls in the iOS 4.3 update.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.This story was updated on 4/18 to note that the AP first reported on the issue of children spending real money on in-app purchases without parental permission. An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed the first report of it to the Washington Post.

The overwhelming success of Apple’s iPhone 4S has finally hit a lull. Since its launch last October, the device has managed to hold on to the title of top selling device in the United States for 10 months before finally being dethroned by the Samsung Galaxy S III last month.According to analyst Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity, monthly channel checks have confirmed that the Galaxy S III is the top selling device at T-Mobile (who doesn’t carry the iPhone 4S), Sprint and Verizon. The iPhone remained the number one device at AT&T, but the S III’s success at the other three largest carriers in the nation is enough to secure the number one spot.The S III wasn’t the only Android device to do well, it’s worth noting that the number two top selling device at Verizon was the Droid RAZR MAXX, and every carrier that sells an HTC One series device has it in their top three.Now that the Galaxy S III has become the top selling device in the nation, can it hold on? Apple, Motorola, HTC, LG, Nokia and even Samsung have new devices slated to hit the market before the end of the year. Still, I’d venture to guess the S III is more than capable of keeping up with whatever hits shelves by the holiday season.

Consumer Reports said Monday it cannot recommend the iPhone 4 after testing confirmed "there is a problem with its reception."The highly regarded publication said its engineers tested three iPhone 4s, and found that complaints by others about the phone's reception are valid. Apple, contacted for comment, has not yet responded."When your finger or hand touches a spot on the phone's lower left side —an easy thing, especially for lefties — the signal can significantly degrade enough to cause you to lose your connection altogether if you're in an area with a weak signal," Consumer Reports said. "Due to this problem, we can't recommend the iPhone 4."There is, the magazine noted, an "affordable solution for suffering iPhone 4 users. Cover the antenna gap with a piece of duct tape or another thick, non-conductive material. It may not be pretty, but it works. We also expect that using a case would remedy the problem. We'll test a few cases this week and report back."Just 10 days ago, Consumer Reports said on its electronics blog that while holding the iPhone 4 "in certain ways does cause signal loss," that's true for "all cell phones.""All phones are subject to interference from the human who is using them," wrote Mike Gikas on the blog. "And even if the alleged signal loss is real, there's an absence of hard evidence that iPhone 4 reception is problematic compared to past iPhones; indeed, there's evidence of just the opposite."However, a note added since then to the blog says "Since posting this report, Mike Gikas has also experienced the 'dropped call' issue which many of our readers have been attesting to in our blog readers' comments section."The iPhone 4 reception and antenna issues began almost immediately after the phone went on sale June 24. The new phone, unlike its predecessors, has the antenna wrapped around the phone's casing, which some have described as a design flaw.Apple, in a previous statement, said that "Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas. This is a fact of life for every wireless phone."The company said that those iPhone 4 users who have the problem should "avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band, or simply use one of many available (phone protector) cases."A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Apple and AT&T, exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the United States, over the iPhone 4's antenna reception.Consumer Reports said that the "signal problem is the reason that we did not cite the iPhone 4 as a 'recommended' model, even though its score in our other tests placed it atop the latest Ratings of smart phones that were released today."The iPhone scored high, in part because it sports the sharpest display and best video camera we've seen on any phone, and even outshines its high-scoring predecessors with improved battery life and such new features as a front-facing camera for video chats and a built-in gyroscope that turns the phone into a super-responsive game controller," the publication said. "But Apple needs to come up with a permanent — and free — fix for the antenna problem before we can recommend the iPhone 4."

Last week’s revelation that Apple iPhones and Google Android-based smart phones were retaining locational information generated howls of protest from privacy advocates and government officials. Concerned that mobile devices were tracking our digital footsteps, many wanted “steps to be taken” to address their worries.Some of the concerns raised about the retention of locational data are valid. But panic, prohibition and a “privacy precautionary principle” that would preemptively block technological innovation until government regulators give their blessings are not valid answers to these concerns. The struggle to conceptualize and protect privacy rights should be an evolutionary and experimental process, not one micro-managed at every turn by regulation.Regulation should enter the picture only when companies break the promises they make to consumers or engage in deceptive practices. If serious harm has come to someone because of data disclosure, the Federal Trade Commission already has the power to crack down on companies, or lawsuits and class actions can be pursued.The data collected on Apple phones was brought to light after some computer science geeks unearthed a file buried on iPhones that can only be read on a computer that is syncing with the user’s device. This means the most likely snoop of your data would be someone already known to you. This could be a problem when an abusive spouse is involved, but in most circumstances, this is likely not a serious issue.Government access to locational data, however, is a more significant issue. Governments possess unique powers the private sector lacks, such as taxation, surveillance, fines, and imprisonment. Indeed, the Obama administration is asking the Supreme Court to rule that the police can surreptitiously attach GPS devices to your car and track your movements—without a warrant or oversight of any kind. Meanwhile in Michigan, police are downloading the entire contents of citizens’ smartphones — including geolocation information, emails, texts, and call histories — when stopping them even for routine traffic offenses.People genuinely concerned about privacy should focus their attention on these state-sponsored abuses and how to limit them. Congress should update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 to ensure adequate safeguards against unwarranted snooping by the law enforcement and a subpoena process that places a high bar on government access to phone records.Some critics worry about companies using locational data for advertising or marketing purposes even though that doesn’t happen much today. Even in this case it is unclear where the harm lies. If our phones know we are walking by an ice cream parlor and the store’s owner is offering free scoops to nearby consumers who find the shop with their phones, that seems like a benefit, not a harm.After all, while for some privacy trumps all other considerations, for others locational data provides the services they expect.  For finding the location of an appointment, seeking out a restaurant in a new neighborhood, or networking with a friend, geo-location is a “must-have” feature on digital devices.Optimally, companies should get clear consent before any “tracking” features collect data about user whereabouts. But in practice, consent can be tricky. What data does the user own? What data do those who provide us with innovative (and often free) services own?

This is most the obvious and the most packed with irony, given that Apple is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/24/apple-samsung-lawsuit-verdict_n_1829268.html?1345857263&utm_hp_ref=technology" target="_hplink">suing</a> Samsung in every country it can. The new, larger iPhone -- with a 4-inch display vs. the 3.5-inch display on all older models -- is closer in size to the 4.8-inch span on the Galaxy S III's screen. Was Apple's decision to up the iPhone's screen real estate a response to the popularity of Samsung's plus-sized and popular handsets?Google, which makes the operating system the Galaxy smartphones run on, is also embroiled in spat with the iPhone maker. Apple snidely decided to make <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/11/apple-debuts-maps-app_n_1587726.html" target="_hplink">its own map app for iOS 6</a>, which ships on the iPhone 5; Google Maps won't be preloaded onto iOS 6 devices. (Users can still go to the App Store and download it themselves.) Apple touts Maps as being <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/" target="_hplink">smooth and responsive,"</a> implying that Google Maps left something to be desired.So the new iPhone can take panoramic photographs, huh? Where have we seen that before? Oh right: Both HTC and Nokia smartphones. Nokia's new Lumia 920 comes with a camera setting that lets users <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57510802-233/iphone-5-vs-galaxy-s3-vs-lumia-920-by-the-numbers/" target="_hplink">create panorama shots of their surroundings</a>; HTC Windows Phones have come with a similar tool into the camera software "for some time now," <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44983/nokia-creative-studio-for-windows-phone" target="_hplink">according to Pocket-lint</a>. (Image courtesy of Apple.)Another nifty photo-related feature of the iPhone 5 is the ability to seamlessly share pictures with your friends. "The Shared Photo Streams feature is arguably the most practical addition, since previously sharing photos by email limited users to sending 5 photos at a time," <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-panoramic-photos-better-photo-sharing-in-new-iphone/" target="_hplink">explains TechCrunch</a>. "MMS'ing photos is also not ideal." But text and email's limitations haven't stopped iPhone users from sharing photos. Instagram didn't get to 100 million users by being a bad alternative for publishing mobile pics. There are also plenty of photo-sharing app out there, with smaller but devoted user bases than Instagram's.

Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas. This is a fact of life for every wireless phone. If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4, avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band, or simply use one of many available cases.So, we just spoke with Apple and got the straight dirt on the reception issues that have been plaguing users today... and it's a little surprising. In essence, Apple cops to the fact there are reception issues with the new iPhone -- namely, that if you cover the bottom-left corner of the phone and bridge the gap between the notch there with your naked flesh, you could see some signal degradation. Yes, you read that right: it's not a software or production issue, simply a matter of the physical location of your hand in regards to the phone's antenna. The company's suggested fix? Move your hand position, or get a case which covers that part of the phone, thus breaking contact. As you can see in the email above which just arrived in our tip box, this is a sentiment which runs pretty high at the company. Here's the official statement:We know what you're thinking, and we're thinking it too: this sounds crazy. Essentially, Apple is saying that the problem is how you hold your phone, and that the solution is to change that habit, or buy one of their cases. Admittedly, this isn't a problem that exists only for the iPhone 4 -- we've seen reports of the same behavior on previous generations (the 3G and 3GS), and there is a running thread about this problem with the Nexus One. While it is definitely true that interference is an unavoidable problem, we can't help feeling like this is really a bit of bad design. If the only answer is to move your hand, why didn't Apple just move the antenna position? What we can say without question is that in our testing of the phone , we had improved reception and fewer dropped calls than we experienced with the last generation, and we never noticed this issue. Additionally, when using a bumper we can't recreate the signal loss. So, now we have an answer... all we're wondering is whether or not the company will start handing out bumpers pro-bono to those who are experiencing problems. It certainly seems like the right thing to do. To add a little perspective, check out a video from 2008 after the break showing the same issue with the now-ancient iPhone 3G (thanks Inge).

Sprint's policy is to have the iPhone 4S SIM locked to our network domestically and internationally. At launch, the International SIM will be unlocked. We do expect a SIM lock to be pushed to the devices shortly after launch. We will then allow existing customers in good standing to unlock the SIM for international use if needed in the future. Customers can sign up for one of our international rate plans and use this phone all over the world. When traveling internationally, there is a setting that must be turned on within the device to connect to GSM. The phone will work with a SIM that is provided within the device out of the box. International voice and data charges are on a pay-as-you-go basis and vary based on the country where the customer is using their phone; a list of rates is available at www.sprint.com/international. Sprint offers two international voice plans that customers can subscribe to for discounted voice rates: * The Canada Roaming add-on is $2.99 per month and all calls placed from Canada are only 20 cents per minute. Without this add-on, calls from Canada are 59 cents per minute. * The Sprint Worldwide Voice add-on is $4.99 per month and offers discounted rates in countries around the world. For example, calls from Italy are $1.69 per minute with this add-on or $1.99 per minute without the add-on; calls from Peru are $2.29 per minute with the add-on or $2.49 per minute without it. Sprint does supply notifications of data roaming charges to protect customers from high costs. Notifications are sent to the customer's preferred method, either text or email, and are sent once the device exceeds approximately $50, $250, $500 and $1,000. To protect the customer from additional charges, the device's international data roaming capability will be suspended after the customer exceeds approximately $1,000 of international data charges in a billing cycle.

'Apple should have kept ours. But what do I know?'Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureGoogle has not made a maps app for the iPhone 5, its chairman Eric Schmidt said this morning - and his company is not working on one.The search engine supremo's snub will come as a blow to fanbois who "upgraded" to the latest Apple smartphone, or installed the new iOS 6 operating system on their fruity gadgets, and found Google's maps app replaced by Apple's less-than-brilliant satnav-like alternative. Many punters have urged Google to produce a new replacement map app.Schmidt revealed that execs at top tech companies chat among themselves a lot, but that obviously doesn't stop the power play that has seen Google's map service booted out of the iPhone. Apple and Google are locked in a battle for supremacy in the mobile tech arena: the search giant's Android operating system is at the heart of smartphones and tablets competing against Apple's iPhones and iPads."We’ve been talking with [Apple] for a long time. We talk to them every day," he insisted. He was mellow on Apple's decision:We think it would have been better if they had kept ours. But what do I know? What were we going to do, force them not to change their mind? It’s their call.Schmidt's aside to a press pack is the only indication from Google so far about its plans for Google Maps on iOS 6, which also powers the new iPhone 5. There was speculation that Google was on the verge of putting out a replacement app available through iTunes.Schmidt took the opportunity to make a few more points about the iPhone: "Apple is the exception, and the Android system is the common model, which is why our market share is so much higher."Schmidt said that the success of Linux-powered Android smartphones has been overlooked by the media, which he said was "obsessed with Apple's marketing events and Apple's branding"."That's great for Apple, but the numbers are on our side," he said. ®

Last night, Google added Google Earth to its arsenal of iPhone / iPod Touch-invading apps and all we can say is wow. We imagine 99% of BGR readers have at least played with Google Earth on a computer at some point but for those few who aren’t familiar, it’s an application that lets you look at… The Earth. You know, like satellite view on Google Maps but waaay more intense. The video above is from Google’s release announcement and it goes through a variety of cool functions that are accessible. The movement and zoom are insanely smooth and clear on the iPhone’s display and that tilt feature is pretty sweet as well. Even if it is just a novelty for most, it’s still one of those must-have apps for when people annoy you with, “what’s so cool about the iPhone anyway?” The app is free of course and you can snag it in iTunes by hitting this link (phobos / iTunes link alert) or by searching Google Earth on your device.

SAN FRANCISCO—In a move expected to revolutionize the mobile device industry, Apple launched its fastest and most powerful iPhone to date Tuesday, an innovative new model that can only be seen by the company's hippest and most dedicated customers."I am proud today to introduce to those who really, truly deserve it, our most incredible iPhone yet," announced Apple CEO Steve Jobs, extending his seemingly empty left palm toward the eagerly awaiting crowd. "Not only is this our lightest and slimmest model ever, but as any truly savvy Apple customer can clearly see, it's also the most handsome product we've ever designed."The packed auditorium, which had been listening to Jobs in hushed reverence for several minutes, then erupted into applause, with hundreds of men and women suddenly jumping to their feet and shouting, "I can see it!" "Look, there it is!" and "God, it's so beautiful!"Screams of "Of course, yes, I too can see the phone," were also heard at this time.According to Apple, the new iPhone 3GI boasts significant hardware and software upgrades, superior processing speeds, and a multi-touch interface that provides those who are "cool enough" with a rich user experience. The wide-screen display reportedly also features the most brilliant colors and finest resolution ever imagined."The new 3GI is as light as air," said Apple senior vice president Philip Schiller, reaching inside an empty display case, apparently to remove the mobile device. "See how thin that is? It's like it's not even there.""Those who really understand what we do here at Apple are going to love this new product," Schiller continued. "Unless, you know, they happen to be totally lame."Retailing for $599, the iPhone 3GI offers only the most special Apple consumers—the ones who believe in the company more than anything else in the world, and who would never, ever dream of questioning it—the ability to open dozens of powerful applications at once. In addition, the new multimedia device will provide true Apple fans with a high-definition video camera, one-tap editing with Final Cut Pro, and cut and paste.Like thousands of others, New York resident Kelly Delaney called in sick to work so that she could join the line outside the Apple Store's trendy SoHo location days before the 3GI went on sale."Oh my God, I can't believe how much faster you can get online with this," said Delaney, who exited the store holding a cupped hand up to her ear and yelling into her wrist about how wonderful the new phone was. "The reception is so clear, and you can pretty much get a signal no matter where you go.""Hold on a sec," continued Delaney, suddenly shaking her hand up and down. "I think my battery is dying."According to Apple, the new iPhone launched in 22 countries and sold a record-breaking 8 million units on its first day."The selection of colors is amazing," said Paul Conrad, a Fairfield, VA native who purchased phones in black, white, and silver. "Not only does it look awesome, but it can do pretty much anything you want as long as you believe in it.""The AppleCare Plan doesn't cover dropping your phone, though, so I'd recommend buying one of these designer protective cases," Conrad added.While the new iPhone has been greatly admired and widely touted for its impressive voice and data communication capabilities, some Americans remain skeptical."Daddy isn't talking into anything at all," said 4-year-old Ella Conrad, pointing at her father, Paul, who has been obsessively staring at, playing with, and customizing the invisible phone since purchasing it Monday. "Daddy's pretending to be on hold with an operator."

Dan Wooley survived under the rubble of a hotel in Haiti after the earthquake by consulting a medical iPhone app to treat his wounds. " />Dan Wooley survived under the rubble of a hotel in Haiti after the earthquake by consulting a medical iPhone app to treat his wounds.The Best Reason to Have an iPhone YetUsually, when someone says their iPhone is a life saver, they are talking about the phone helping them find a good takeout spot or an emergency bathroom.When Dan Woolley says it, he really means it. He used a medical app saved on his phone to treat a leg injury after the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince collapsed around him.Woolley, who is from Colorado Springs, is one of the Americans who survived the massive earthquake that hit Haiti last week, and he did it with an iPhone application. Woolley is now recovering at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, but it was his fast actions with the app that may have saved his life.Woolley used the light from his iPhone to show him his injuries and diagnosed it properly as a broken foot. Then, he used the instructions from the app to treat the excessive bleeding from cuts on his legs and the back of his head.Woolley used his shirt to tie off the three-inch gash that was opened on his leg and a sock to bandage the back of his head. He said he also looked up ways to stop from going into shock."I kind of had some time to do some self-diagnosis down there," Woolley said. "God was with me."Not bad for a film producer who was in Haiti filming a documentary on efforts to help the nation's poverty-stricken children.Woolley also used his camera to take pictures of the surrounding rubble to piece together a way out. He eventually took refuge in an elevator shaft until rescue crews found him 65 hours after the earthquake."I took pictures all around me, then I would hold up the back of the camera to me and I could see what the picture was of a little," he said. "I was able to find an elevator in one of the pictures and that is where I decided to hobble to be in a more safe location."On Tuesday, Woolley told The Today Show he knew he was going to die and decided to write a journal on his notepad to his wife and young kids in the event someone found his corpse under the rubble."I was in a big accident. Don't be upset at God. He always provides for his children even in hard times," Woolley wrote in the dim light. "I'm still praying that God will get me out but he may not but He will always take care of ya."

Anticipation for the launch of the Raspberry Pi $25 PC continues to grow as its launch window gets ever closer. Over the past few months it has been surprising to see what the tiny machine is capable of. Videos of it running Quake III, playing back 1080p video, and handling graphics-intensive particle and sprite demos have all impressed, but until now we haven’t really been able to gauge how the device compares to other gadgets.Eben Upton has an interview going live today with Eurogamer’s Digital Foundry, and it offers up new insight into just how powerful the Raspberry Pi is. You may be surprised to find what it is actually better than in terms of performance.The Raspberry Pi relies on a custom chipset from Broadcom called the BCM2835. Being custom, it has allowed the development team to tweak performance to the point where Eben believes it is the best mobile GPU available. That’s easy to say when you’ve worked on the chip, so he’s given some examples to show how well it performs. The GPU apparently doubles the performance currently found in the iPhone 4S. It is also expected to easily outperform Nvidia’s Tegra 2.If you consider what an iPhone 4S is capable of, and all those devices running graphically intensive apps on the Tegra 2 platform, you can see the potential impact the Raspberry Pi could have.The reason the Raspberry Pi exists is to get cheap computers into the hands of kids and available in every classroom. Get the younger generations programming and experimenting and you have an army of budding software and hardware engineers ready to build the next Google or Apple in years to come. But the computing power on offer in such a cheap package means Raspberry Pi could impact more than just kids and schools. The hardware is more than capable of being a HTPC, it could replace more expensive home PCs, and I’ve already suggested the $100 PC is now viable.To classify the Raspberry Pi as a cheap PC for kids is to sell it very short. Just like Arduino opened up electronics to everyone, the $25 PC could become the heart of many a new product as well as redefining what we class as an affordable home computer.

AT&T has issued a press release today announcing that MMS will become active for iPhone users on September 25.We've been working for the past several months to prepare our systems and network to ensure the best possible experience with MMS when it launches - and that launch date is: September 25 for iPhone 3G and 3GS customers. MMS will be enabled through a software update on that day.AT&T points to the need for the company to build out its network infrastructure to handle the demands of heavy MMS messaging volumes as the primary reason for the delay in launching the service compared to carriers in other countries that have offered MMS since the launch of iPhone OS 3.0 in June. As announced in June, MMS messaging will be included at no additional cost to users with an iPhone text messaging plan. There has been much speculation on the availability of MMS from AT&T, some with dubious origins . Next week's Apple media event had been the subject of some speculation as a possible venue for AT&T to launch MMS, which was first promised at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June, though today's news has put all such rumors to bed.

So for those who haven't been following along, Giz got their hands on the new iPhone, they make a post that garnishes them 4 million page views in a day. Cool. The phone belonged to a poor schmuck who got drunk and left it on a stool. Whatever.But then Giz decides to post the kid who lost the phone's personal info, Facebook page and Flickr, all alongside a picture of the dude holding a WHISKEY bottle. Basically portraying him as an alcoholic dumbass, while simultaneously painting a picture of Giz being totally innocent, along with the dude who "found" the phone sitting on the stool. That post here. Why do this? Why piss on this guys corpse? What exactly did they gain from basically placing a Dunce cap on his head for the rest of his career?I state that this is a douche move in a comment, and get greeted with this... HAHAHAHA... What kind of horse shit is this? I understand that it's their site... But what is up with these dudes? I haven't been following them long enough to know if they are just naturally assholes, or if this is newfound confidence in the wake of buying a stolen iPhone.EDIT: masklin posted this, its Craig Hockenberry's attempt to get some kind of apology from Giz for basically blackballing this kid.

A day after converting the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full-fledged release, Skype pushes out updates to its Windows software and its iPhone app.Updated on July 2, 2009, at 9:02 a.m. PT with more from Skype regarding push notification for the iPhone/iPod Touch app.Skype is certainly on a roll this week. Just yesterday it converted the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full-fledged release. On Tuesday, the VoIP company did it again for Skype 4.1 for Windows. In addition, Apple green-lighted Skype 1.1 for the iPhone and iPod Touch, which you can download now.Skype 4.1 beta brought back features like accessibility, birthday reminders, and the capability to send a contact record to another contact. These had been left out when Skype first updated its interface to the 4.0 style, the company citing a wish to get core features out the door before piling on the extras. It's these extras that users nevertheless clamored for. This minor point update also contains a major new feature that was first introduced in Skype 4.1 beta: screen sharing.Screen sharing initiates a video call, using the technology to broadcast a recording of your screen--either a portion or the full screen--to one other viewer. Screen sharing has some limitations: you can't simultaneously see a video of your buddy and their desktop, and since only one viewer at a time can peep at your screen, you can't use it as a free replacement for collaborative Web conferencing. It doesn't help that the picture quality is still choppy and fuzzy, in both partial-screen and full-screen view modes.Make no mistake, though: it's a great feature that we're happy to see added, but we'll be even happier to watch it improve.In addition to screen sharing, Skype 4.1 lets you feed a contact search from outside address books, including those in Gmail, AOL, MSN, Yahoo, Microsoft Outlook, and a host of other players. If you have it installed, the Web toolbar will highlight phone numbers within contact lists so you can call them through Skype.Skype 1.1 for iPhone and iPod Touch reintroduces the capability to listen to Skype voice mail and to send and receive SMS messages. These features had been available on the desktop version, but were not activated when Skype first came out for iPhone.There are a few visual tweaks, also, which gloss up the look and feel of a few screens, most notably the dial pad. To top off the changes, this iPhone update pours on multilingual support, making it available in Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, and Traditional Chinese.Skype for iPhone still has far to go if it's to get all of the extra features that round out the Skype experience--games and conference calling are but two. Push notification is another that Skype users are now asking for. Skype told CNET that they wanted to first integrate SMS and voice mail, the two most-requested features. As for push notification, Skype isn't making any commitments at this point, but a representative from the company vaguely stated, "Where we're able to use functionality provided by the iPhone OS to support a rich Skype experience on the iPhone platform, we will endeavor to do so." Still, it's a fair guess that a future version could notify you when someone is calling.In the future, we're looking forward to what Skype might do with video calls now that the iPhone 3GS has its shiny new video recorder.

I bought a Samsung Omnia 7 phone. The deciding reason for me was the price as the phone had lost more than 40% from the original price (at online stores). I checked it out at a normal store and was impressed. Really liked how it looked and felt, so I bought it. That was 3 weeks ago... since then I've been under attack. People directly laughing at me, mocking me for being totally lost in the tech world, telling me what a huge mistake I have made and that I should give it back. EVERYBODY is explaining what a shitty product it is... forget the iPhone owners, even dumb phone users are schooling me... I feel like I work for Microsoft everytime I try to suggest that I actually like the thing and that it works fine for me, especially as I paid 50% less than what I had originally planned on spending on a smart phone.I can't believe this shit. What the fuck is wrong with people these days? Can someone remind me, why everybody hates Microsoft so much?! I've never felt any warm feeling for MS but they never really did anything wrong to me.

A "serious memory corruption bug" in the iPhone can make it vulnerable to being taken over by a single specially-crafted text message, security researchers showed today. So if you get a text message that consists of a square on your iPhone - perhaps you should worry. Or, much more likely, it's a prank from a friend trying to freak you out. The Black Hat conference in Las Vegas saw a demonstration by Collin Mulliner and Charlie Miller, who are independent security experts, who proved the weakness by taking control of an iPhone belonging to CNet's Elinor Mills. Mills described it thus: While I was talking on the phone to Charlie Miller, his partner, Collin Mulliner, sent me a text message from his phone. One minute I'm talking to Miller and the next minute my phone is dead, and this time it's not AT&T's fault. After a few seconds it came back to life, but I was not able to make or receive calls until I rebooted. The researchers told Mills that "an attacker could exploit the hole to make calls, steal data, send text messages, and do basically anything that I can do with my iPhone". How many iPhones are vulnerable? All of them. How many will be affected? Ah, that's a lot harder. Not the majority. Not even a large minority. It depends on whether Apple can fix the problem before the malicious hackers out there figure out how the hack is done.

Fruity peddler of broken iPhones, Apple is leaning on a kid for doing what it can't manage – making a white iPhone 4.Apple has been putting off making a white iPhone 4 until next March because it claims that it is pretty tricky. This has apparently opened the market for those who think it is a doddle.It is such an easy task that Fei "Phil" Lam, 17, from New York, has been cashing in by flogging a converter kit that turns black iPhone 4s into white ones.Apple's response has been to send the boys around. According to the Sydney Morning Herald Lam claims that Jobs' Mob had sent around a private dick to try and gag him from selling the kits. He also claims he had Apple shut down his eBay listings too.So far he has made about $30,000 to $40,000 from the kits which cost up to $279 each.What is doubly embarrassing for Apple is that the kits use parts supplied by the suicide plagued Foxconn, which makes the iPhone in China. The question is then, if Lam can make a White iPhone using kit from Apple's own supplier, why can't Apple?The answer might be in the price tag. Lam said it costs him a lot to bring the components for the kits into the country and he does not have a high mark up. It might be that it is too expensive for Jobs' Mob to get its traditional high mark-up for a white case.It might be that Apple does not have to take too much action against Lam – after he has made a bit of dosh he plans to go to college.   Lam says he is an Apple fanboy, but admits he does not own an iPhone.  Apparently, despite all the cash he has made he does not think he can afford one.  This is how someone ends up being a billionaire before they are 20.

Apple on Wednesday apologized for technology issues that crippled the iPhone 4 pre-order process, but said that the company processed orders for 600,000 of the devices in one day.As a result, new orders will not ship until at least July 14, according to the Apple Web site."It was the largest number of pre-orders Apple has ever taken in a single day and was far higher than we anticipated, resulting in many order and approval system malfunctions," Apple said. "Many customers were turned away or abandoned the process in frustration. We apologize to everyone who encountered difficulties, and hope that they will try again or visit an Apple or carrier store once the iPhone 4 is in stock."The new iPhone 4 is not scheduled to hit stores until June 24, but Apple, AT&T and several other retail outlets started taking pre-orders for the device on June 15. Unfortunately, the companies' systems could not handle the extra demand, and many online buyers were met with timed-out browsers and 404 errors.Apple subsequently updated its Web site to say that pre-orders going forward will not ship until July 2. The company's pre-order site now says they will ship by July 14.Earlier today, AT&T said its pre-order sales were 10 times higher than pre-orders for the iPhone 3GS last year. Faced with this "unprecedented demand," AT&T suspended the pre-order process on Wednesday "in order to fulfill the orders we've already received."Apple's inventory will determine when AT&T resumes pre-orders, the company said.There were also reports that people trying to purchase the iPhone 4 accidentally saw the personal information of other iPhone customers. AT&T said it has "been unable to replicate the issue, but the information displayed did not include call-detail records, social security numbers, or credit card information.""In the meantime, we are looking into this matter," the company concluded.Radio Shack, which was accepting in-person pre-orders at its stores, also ended the program amidst demand. Wednesday afternoon, Best Buy said it too had suspended iPhone 4 pre-orders. Wal-Mart is expected to start selling the iPhone 4 in select stores starting June 24.Editor's Note: This story was updated at 4pm Eastern time with information from Best Buy.

A major security flaw that has existed in Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone since the device was first released in 2007 has been revealed by a well-known hacker. The iOS security researcher, known publicly only as “pod2g,” on Friday published details about the vulnerability, which affects all versions of iOS through to the latest beta release of iOS 6.According to pod2g’s report, the reply-to number that is displayed when an iPhone user views an SMS can easily be manipulated to display a number other than the one sending the message. Using a simple procedure, this exploit can be used by malicious attackers to send messages that appear to be from a trusted source — a bank, perhaps — but any replies to the SMS would be routed to a separate phone number without the sender’s knowledge.Pod2g notes that the iPhone is not the only handset vulnerable to the flaw.“In the text payload, a section called UDH (User Data Header) is optional but defines lot of advanced features not all mobiles are compatible with,” he explained. “One of these options enables the user to change the reply address of the text. If the destination mobile is compatible with it, and if the receiver tries to answer to the text, he will not respond to the original number, but to the specified one.”The researcher says this security flaw is severe and he urges users to be wary of any SMS messages asking for sensitive information.

What's more annoying than spending hours lining up for a shiny new gadget? Learning that your precious phone can't actually connect to the network. Well, depending on how you hold it -- word has it that the iPhone 4's bottom-left corner isn't playing nice with your skin. If you recall from the keynote , that's where the Bluetooth / WiFi / GPS antenna meets its GSM / UMTS counterpart. So we decided to test on two brand new iPhone 4 handsets purchased today in the UK.One iPhone 4 demonstrated the issue everytime it was held in our left hand (as a right-handed person is apt to do) so that our palm was essentially bridging the two antennas. You can see that in the video after the break. Bridging the two with a finger tip, however, didn't cause any issues with the reported reception. If we had to guess, we'd say that our conductive skin was acting to detune the antenna -- in fact, we've already managed to slowly kill two calls that way so it's not just an issue with the software erroneously reporting an incorrect signal strength. That said, we had no issues when Apple's $29 rubber bumper accessory (given to us free for standing in line) was attached, creating a buffer between our palm and the antennas. Our second UK-purchased iPhone 4 was fine, showing none of these handling symptoms. See the video evidence after the break including Insanely Great Mac's version which got us to worrying in the first place.P.S. Don't forget to take our poll and let us know if you're seeing both the yellow spots / stripes and reception issues. Unfortunately, we're suffering from both flaws which is not a good sign for quality control on this first batch of Apple handsets.P.P.S. Since some of you are asking, our review unit showed none of these issues. Apple responds to the issue, and boy, it's a doozy

Dozens of law-enforcement agencies across the U.S. are preparing to use a new, mobile facial-recognition tool to identify individuals. There's also an Android version in the works.Some law-enforcement agencies are preparing to deploy a mobile facial-recognition tool, The Wall Street Journal reported today.According to the Journal, about 40 law-enforcement agencies across the U.S. will be making the handheld product available to their officers in the field as early as September. The device, which has been developed by Massachusetts-based BI2 Technologies, allows officers to take a photo of a person from a distance of five feet or less. That photo is then compared with a database of images of people with criminal records to see if there is a match. The device is also capable of scanning a person's iris.Like with any other platform, there are some limitations with BI2's device. For one, it needs to be attached to the back of an iPhone in order to work, which leaves out agencies using Android, Windows Phone, or any other devices. According to the Journal, BI2 will offer an Android-capable version "in the future" but didn't say when.In addition, BI2's database isn't necessarily exhaustive. The Journal said that it includes photos of correctional facility inmates but that only a few states are allowing the company to access mug shots. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal logs, as well as photos on driver's licenses, are not included in the database.Facial recognition has always been a hot-button issue for privacy advocates, and BI2's technology likely will face the same concerns. Realizing that, Sheriff Paul Babeu of Arizona's Pinal County told the Journal that his officers will only use the tool when a person of interest isn't carrying any form of identification. What's more, he said, his officers will not use it without cause.Facial recognition came back into the forefront of the privacy debate last month when the European Union decided to examine Facebook's facial-recognition feature to whether it violates any privacy regulations.That decision followed a claim by CNN that Google was working on a facial-recognition application. Immediately, Google fired back, saying that it wasn't doing anything of the sort.At the D9 Conference in May, Google's former CEO and current executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, acknowledged that Google had come close to offering facial recognition in its Google Goggles image-recognition service, but Schmidt stopped it before it could launch. He said he was concerned that facial recognition can be used for both good and bad.Even so, the company has been involved with facial recognition in the past, offering the technology in its Picasa photo-management service.For law-enforcement agencies, there are also legal implications of facial recognition. As the Journal points out, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that agencies must have "reasonable suspicion" in order to fingerprint an individual. Whether agencies need to have the same "suspicion" to use BI2's tool remains to be seen.Regardless, it seems that at least some law-enforcement agencies believe the technology will be extremely beneficial. In an Arizona Republic article posted on BI2's site, Babeu said that the technology has been valuable on multiple levels for law-enforcement agencies."From an officer-safety perspective, to find out who we are dealing with, this literally leapfrogged us ahead in the ability of law enforcement to best protect our community," Babeu said.

Apple‘s iCloud service brings a whole raft of services — email, calendar, contacts, ‘Find My iPhone” and cloud storage — and stores them behind a single username and password. This is very convenient, but if that username and password falls into the wrong hands, you can find yourself very quickly in a world of pain.This is what happened to Mat Honan, former journalist for Gizmodo and former contributing editor to WIRED magazine. Before the hackers gained access to his Twitter account and that of Gizmodo, the hackers first gained access to his iCloud account, where they caused irrevocable havoc.At 4:50 PM, someone got into my iCloud account, reset the password and sent the confirmation message about the reset to the trash. My password was a 7 digit alphanumeric that I didn’t use elsewhere. When I set it up, years and years ago, that seemed pretty secure at the time. But it’s not. Especially given that I’ve been using it for, well, years and years. My guess is they used brute force to get the password, and then reset it to do the damage to my devices. The backup email address on my Gmail account is that same .mac email address. At 4:52 PM, they sent a Gmail password recovery email to the .mac account. Two minutes later, an email arrived notifying me that my Google Account password had changed. At 5:00 PM, they remote wiped my iPhone At 5:01 PM, they remote wiped my iPad At 5:05, they remote wiped my MacBook Air.I still can’t get into Gmail. My phone and iPads are down (but are restoring). Apple tells me that the remote wipe is likely irrecoverable without serious forensics. Because I’m a jerk who doesn’t back up data, I’ve lost at more than a year’s worth of photos, emails, documents, and more. And, really, who knows what else.To do all the damage all the hackers needed to do was to get their hands on a single username and password. Honan believes that this was done by a process called brute forcing, that is, trying passwords until you get lucky. It’s a long process, but if the password is simple or short enough, it’s doable. Short passwords are almost as bad as no password at all, in fact, they’re worse because they lull you into a false sense of security.As pointed out in the comments on Honan’s post, another problem with iCloud is that you only need a username and password to access the account, while Google accounts can be protected by a 2-step verification. Here, along with your username and password, you can set your Google account  to ask you for a six-digit code that Google will send via text message to your phone. While this is no doubt more hassle than just using just the username and password, it dramatically improves account security.If you have an iCloud account, let this be a warning to you. I suggest you change your password, and pick something long and random — I know I have.It’s a dangerous place out there!

iPhone 4 users, did your alarm go off today? SINGAPORE : Some iPhone 4 users got off to a bad start in the New Year when the alarm function of their phones failed to go off, apparently due to a bug in the smart phone's operating system. The problem was first reported in Australia and New Zealand, which were the first countries to ring in the New Year. And complaints have come fast and furious on sites such as Twitter. iPhone user Ameer Assik Shahrir was one of those tripped up by the bug. He had set his alarm for 7.30am, but woke up only at 8.30am. He said: "This morning, I was late for breakfast by one hour, I was supposed to meet a few friends. "If this was a school day, I would have been late by one hour and it wouldn't be good." And it wasn't good at all for those who had to work on New Year's Day. One of them called the Channel NewsAsia hotline. Alex Lam said: "I set my alarm last night for 6.30 this morning. I only received a call from my colleague at 8am, and that was when I realised I was already late for work. "I immediately went to work and noticed my colleagues were also late because their iPhone alarms also did not go off." According to tech websites, users can avoid the problem by setting the alarm to the "repeat" mode. The alarm function can apparently revert to normal on January 3. Sites such as 9to5 Mac also report that only iPhones using specific versions of the iOS 4 operating system - in particular, the 4.2.1, 4.1 and 4.0.2 versions - may be affected. However, the extent of the problem is still unclear. IPhone maker Apple has not made an official comment yet. But it had promised an upgrade of the operating system soon, following similar glitches in November when the phone's clock failed to register the switch from daylight savings time. - CNA/wk/ms

The clone manufacturer who released an iPhone 5 knock-off last week now says that they will sue Apple if they release the real iPhone 5 in China. Surreal? Hilarious? Pathetic? All of the above.Hong Kong-based GooPhone, who designed their cheapo Android phone after the alleged Apple iPhone 5 parts leaked during the last few months, has a very rational argument: they have released their clone first, so everything that comes after that must be a copy, even if they actually made their phone after the parts of a phone that hasn't been released yet but that everyone believes is the real thing.In other words: since their clone was released first, that makes it the original phone. The iPhone 5 is the actual clone, not theirs.Makes sense? Of course it doesn't. Who cares! It's fun!I just hope Samsung is taking notes and hurries up to release an iPhone 5 clone as soon as possible. Come on, Samsung—you got one week! You can totally do this.

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- European telcos are likely to subsidize Apple's new version of the iPhone, say analysts.Exclusive Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) partner O2 is expected to sell the hotly-anticipated 3G iPhone for about $196 or £100, according to a report by the U.K's Times Online, citing a UBS analyst report. The speculation follows a story first reported by Fortune.com that AT&T (T, Fortune 500) was planning to sell the new iPhone this summer for around $200.Apple CEO Steve Jobs is widely expected to unveil the faster, sleeker version of the iPhone during the company's developer conference in one week. The new iPhone would be available later this month in the U.S. through Apple and AT&T. AT&T pricing strategy calls for a $200 subsidy for customers who sign two-year service contracts."It will be subsidized," says CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood, of O2's iPhone price plan. "But it won't be free," Wood speculates. O2 customers "will have to take connections or contracts at the point of purchase. They will have to sign on the dotted line. That's how they will make sure they get their money back," says Wood.The lower-priced phones in the U.S. and potentially the U.K. and other parts of Europe would help juice the iPhone's sales volume and give the telcos an attractive weapon to win new subscribers.In the United States, AT&T says it pulls in an average of $95 a month from each iPhone customer, nearly twice the average monthly bill of its conventional cell phone user. AT&T has a revenue-sharing agreement with Apple that requires it to give Apple as much as 25% of its iPhone customers' monthly payments.Subsidies are a widespread pricing practice in the United States and overseas. In exchange for a cheaper phone, customers are locked in to a carrier for a year or two. It's a small investment by the telcos for a large return, as Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi outlined in a report last month.Cutting the price of the iPhone in half would put the cost of the phone within reach of more consumers and likely double the number of iPhones sold, Sacconaghi argues. After giving Apple its cut of the revenue, the remaining take for AT&T is between $70 and $75 a month per iPhone user, totaling more than $1,700 over the life of the two-year contract, wrote Sacconaghi.Though it didn't get much attention at the time, on anApril 23 conference call with analysts, Apple CFO Tim Cook said the company didn't put price guidelines on European carriers selling the original iPhone."The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that, I wouldn't comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential," Cook said at the time.One thing is clear, the iPhone's manufacturer's suggested retail price of $400 seems more fluid than ever."There's certainly more flexibility in pricing," says CCS Insight's Wood.

GooPhone, the Chinese company behind an Android phone designed to resemble leaked iPhone 5 parts, is now planning to sue Apple if the finalized device actually ends up looking like their phone.GooPhone released their shameless Android-based rip-off of leaked iPhone 5 prototypes, the GooPhone i5, to Chinese markets last week. In their minds, this means that they went to market with the design before Apple, and that if the iPhone 5 actually does end up looking like the leaks that we've seen so far, then Apple is copying them. Talk about twisted logic, but then again, this is China.It'll be interesting to see if this suit actually does go anywhere. But before we even come to that, it all depends on whether the iPhone 5 - or whatever Apple decides to call it - actually resembles the leaks that we've seen so far, and whether or not GooPhone is willing to go all in on their crazy plan. Whatever happens, it's going to be hilarious to watch. Can these copyright battles get any crazier?

The video below is very boring, but you should watch it anyway. Its subject is a totally unspectacular mid-grade projection on a dark wall with big implications for the near-term future of human communication and entertainment. The hook is that this image is generated by a Toshiba Pico Prototype the size of a large cell-phone (at right). Capable of spitting out a 60” wide image at 10 lumens, the micro-projector is due to hit store shelves sometime early next year and will also be licensed to a wide variety of other companies.Take a look for yourself:As such projectors shrink in size, increase their resolution and require less and less power, it’s clear that they’ll be incorporated into mobile and other devices. I’d be completely shocked if Steve Jobs, the folks at Apple and all their competitors aren’t right now scrambling to develop the appropriate apps and incorporate the Pico technology into their next-gen products.

NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- If you've ever wanted to know how much money Apple (AAPL) is making on each iPhone you buy, here's your chance.The iPhone is the most profitable, and ultimately the most popular, product in Apple's portfolio, based on revenue and sales. Even with a sales shortfall, Apple still sold an impressive 26 million iPhones in the third quarter. Research firm IHS has come up with the cost of manufacturing the iPhone 5, and, unsurprisingly, Apple's estimated margins are astounding.The cost of the new iPhone 5 sets Apple back between $207 and $238, according to IHS, depending on whether the model is the 16 GB, the 32 GB, or the 64 GB version. At $649 for the 16 GB model, Apple is generating $442 per phone in profits, excluding outside expenses. While Apple's spend on marketing, advertising, employees, and other expenses, is unknown (Apple doesn't break down its cost of sales), the tech giant's could be generating margins of at least 68% on the iPhone 5.See if ( AAPL) is in our portfolioThis is pretty impressive, especially when you think about all the new features on the iPhone 5 such as LTE, an in-cell display and a new A6 processor.Apple's component costs include, but are not limited to, parts from SanDisk (SNDK), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM), and lest we forget, Samsung, which is a "frenemy.""While most manufacturers make great effort to simplify designs by minimizing the total number of mechanical parts and fasteners in their products, Apple appears to be going in the other direction with the iPhone 5," said Kevin Keller, senior principal analyst, teardown analysis, for IHS. "The iPhone 5 incorporates even more mechanical parts than previous iPhone designs, resulting in a very complex assembly. But Apple can do this and still produce the iPhone 5 at such low costs due to its capability to leverage its vast army of low-cost labor."The ability of Apple to lead the smartphone industry in margins has been one of the principal reasons shares are up more than 70% year-to-date. Margins for older iPhones, such as the 4 and 4S, are likely higher, as costs have gone down.Now you have an idea how much money Apple is making when you buy the iPhone 5.Interested in more on Apple?

This is complete speculation based on the facts we know. Apple gets a share of the profit from AT&T iPhone subscribers. Gene Munster in 2007 suggested that Apple is getting $18/mo per iPhone subscriber from AT&T. BUT, what if that number is based on net profit?Yesterday (Aug 1) the Washington Post published an article to which AT&T replied that:BUT.. What if Apple was being paid profit based on usage? So, instead of the $18/mo that was suggested in 2007, what if it was really a percentage? Apps like Skype, Fring, Slingbox, Google Voice, etc. that would cause AT&T to spend more money relative to some baseline usage scenario, would in effect cost Apple money.Imagine it this way. If you're a normal iPhone user who's paying around $90/mo for service, and you use your phone what AT&T and Apple consider an "Average" amount, Apple is paid 20%, or $18. But, there is an increased cost to AT&T if you use your phone substantially more than Average. Let's say, the cost to provide service to an Average customer is $54, which means the net profit is $36. Apple and AT&T split that amount. (These numbers are made up to show my idea.. just bear with me). But, for a high-usage account, the cost to provide service might be closer to $75. That means there's only $15 net profit for AT&T and Apple to share. Apple suddenly loses $10.50 per subscriber, per month that uses at the higher level. (Again, 50% of $15 = $7.50. $18-$7.50 = $10.50)If AT&T is correct, and they really didn't have anything to do with the App removal, and Apple IS to blame, this scenario fits. It explains why Apple restricts high bandwidth apps. They want to keep the cost of the service low to maximize their profit.Again, this is speculation.. But, it's not something I've seen ANYONE else suggest. Am I totally out-to-lunch? Did I just hit the nail on the head? Let me know!

2008 was a big turning point for Japanese mobile industry. In early 2008, Japanese ministry of internal affairs and communications asked all the mobile phone operators to change the way they sell their cell phones.  Before that Japan was abundant of 1 yen cell phones and even 0 yen cell phones with the real cost hidden in the 2 year contract and higher than international average monthly fee. The ministry asked to display the real cost of the phone unit at the store front. And because R&D cost for the Japanese high-tech phones kept going up for the past few years, the customers finally realized the real cost of the handset were actually more than 30,000 yen (about $300) for the mid-range and more than 80,000 yen ($800) for the high-end phones.  Although, few people are paying it in full and are rather paying it monthly for 2 years; still this notion of the real price deeply discouraged people from buying a new phone.  Then came the bad economy.  So 2008 was the year that Japanese mobile phone industry sunk; the total unit shipment of all operators combined went down for 18.7% (according to Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association) to 42 million units which makes iPhone almost has the 1% share; In January 2007, Steve Jobs said he will have 1% share of the worldwide market.   Well, in Japan, too. They got that number of share in this very competitive market.I use it to get on train (so I don't need to purchase tickets), with it I don't have to go to the counter at the airport and go directly to the boarding gate (because it works as your electronic ticke for airplane, too). I can ride a taxi with it and buy almost anything and eat/drink any thing at any of those shopping complex run by Japanese Railways group. But if that turns out to harm the iPhone sales in Japan, I think Apple will change their deal with SoftBank and start selling iPhone through NTT DoCoMo as well. Actually, Japanese press, including me, has been writing this for a long time; and I think this has been harming SoftBank iPhone sales, too. Those iPhone fans who use NTT DoCoMo right now kind of waited until the DoCoMo version comes out. Some gave up and switched to SoftBank, some can't switch, so they added iPhone as the second phone, but there are still many who can't take either way and sticking with the old NTT DoCoMo phone.I believe you will be only using a small portion of this e-mail in your article. So if you don't mind, I would like to edit this a bit and post to my English blog because I haven't updated that for a while;  perhaps, with an affiliated link to the issue of Wired magazine, you will be writing this article for or something.

Apple has quietly enabled a mobile ads tracking system in iOS 6, with unique per-device identifiers that provide advertisers with more user information than ever before. Having blocked developers from using UDID codes – device-specific codes that could be monitored to see if adverts led to app downloads – Apple replaced the unofficial functionality with an official version, IFA/IFDA (Identifier For Advertising) that comes automatically set active, Business Insider reports.Unlike UDID numbers, which are assigned to the device and cannot be changed, IFA codes are designed to be ephemeral. Created randomly and then anonymously assigned to a phone or tablet, they transiently link publishers serving up adverts and the ad servers so that an appropriate advert is displayed on subsequent browsing.If you go on to download an app, the ad server can see what led you to that download, something which was impossible to track previously. There’s no personally-identifiable data, but the fact that Apple has it turned on by default might frustrate or upset some privacy advocates.IFA can be switched off on iOS 6 devices, though the setting to do so isn’t where you’d perhaps first expect. Rather than being part of the Privacy options, it’s under General > About > Advertising, and labeled “Limit Ad Tracking”; for IFA to be deactivated, the switch must – arguably counter-intuitively – be set to “on” rather than “off.”“The biggest thing we’re excited about is that it’s on by default, so we expect most people will leave it on” ad provider Mobile Theory’s CEO Scott Swanson told BI, saying that while the data was personally non-identifiable, it nonetheless provided “a really meaningful inference of behavior” previously unavailable to advertisers.

Apple (AAPL) customers are famed for their loyalty, but it looks as though some of them may not be as fanatical as they’ve been in the past. New data from Strategy Analytics shows that 75% of iPhone owners in Western Europe said they would buy an Apple device for their next smartphone, versus 88% who said they’d buy an iPhone for their next device last year. iPhone user loyalty also dipped slightly in the United States, with 88% of iPhone owners saying they’d buy an Apple smartphone in the future, down from 93% last year. Paul Brown, the director at Strategy Analytics’ User Experience Practice, said that Apple’s loyalty numbers may have taken a hit because of “negative press prompted by a perceived lack of recent innovation.” Strategy Analytics’ press release is posted below.Boston, MA – October 30, 2012 – For the first time since the Apple iPhone was released in 2007, the number of iPhone owners who say they definitely will or probably will purchase their next phone from the same brand has declined.The recent Strategy Analytics Wireless Device Lab Report, iPhone Owner Loyalty Declines: Is Apple Losing its Innovation Edge?, found that only 75 percent of iPhone owners in Western Europe say they are likely to buy their next phone from Apple, down from 88 percent in 2011. US repeat purchase intentions have also seen a slight decline, down from 93 percent in 2011 to 88 percent in 2012.“There is no doubt that Apple is continuing its success in retaining existing user base while attracting new customers,” commented Paul Brown, Director at Strategy Analytics’ User Experience Practice. “However, negative press prompted by a perceived lack of recent innovation by Apple has meant we are starting to see some growth in the number of previously highly loyal consumers who are now reconsidering whether or not they will purchase a new iPhone for their next device.”Taryn Tulay, Analyst at Strategy Analytics’ Wireless Device Lab added, “Respondents who say they probably will or definitely will not buy their next phone from Apple is low. However, it is the shift in the number of those who are unsure whether they will remain with the same brand for their next phone that Apple should be concerned about.”

According to research carried out by app store analytics company Distimo, the majority of sales taking place in the App Store are for games, while Android users are buying more tools and applications.Studying the top 15 paid applications  for the iPhone, the report found nine of them were games, while not even one game made the top 15 on the Android chart. To balance that, not one productivity or utilities app appeared in Apple’s top 15.This pattern continues for free games as well. One important point from the report is Classic games on Android Market are more popular than in the Apple App Store, with even 3 out of the 15 most popular games for Android being emulators. These types of emulators are not allowed in the Apple App Store.If you are a developer you can sign up for developing apps for iphoneand android.

We all saw this one coming a mile away: Apple is finally being taken to task over iOS 4 performance on the iPhone 3G. In a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of California for San Diego, plaintiff Biana Wofford alleges that Apple purposely crippled the iPhone 3G with its introduction of iOS 4 in order to boost iPhone 4 sales, and hopes to get her lawsuit elevated to class action status.Apple originally marketed iOS 4 as a major upgrade for iPhone 3G and 3GS users. That operating system came out just days before Apple started selling the iPhone 4 to the public, but iPhone 3G users quickly learned that it wasn't what they had been hoping for. There were soon widespread reports of extremely slow and buggy performance of iOS 4 on the iPhone 3G, not to mention the fact that the iPhone 3G didn't get all of the features that came with iOS 4 in the first place.According to Wofford's complaint, Apple knew that the update from iOS 3.x would turn her iPhone 3G into a "device with little more use than that of a paper weight." She also criticized Apple over the difficulty in downgrading to a previous operating system without having to become a "hacker"—indeed, it's no simple task for average users to roll back if they have already upgraded to the newest operating system."Even though Apple has actual knowledge of thousands of complaints from iPhone 3G/3GS consumers, Apple does not allow for those same users/consumers of third generation devices to download and re-install earlier and optimized iOS3.x operating system without resorting to 'hacker' tactics that will void Apple warranties and violate iPhone user agreements," Wofford wrote.Wofford believes that Apple did this all to leave iPhone 3G users with unusable phones, forcing them to upgrade to the newly released iPhone 4. What's unclear is whether Wofford attempted to go to an Apple Store or call AppleCare for help on her issue before filing the lawsuit. Regardless, she accuses Apple of engaging in false advertising and unfair competition, and wants the court to give her (and other class members) restitution and damages.On the one hand, this case seems to join the countless others filed by unsatisfied customers over iPhone-related issues. On the other, it's a somewhat new angle—the iOS 4 performance problems on iPhone 3G are pretty well documented (we've experienced them ourselves), and she does have a point that it's not easy to downgrade the OS once you've committed to upgrading. Though we wouldn't be surprised if this case ended up disappearing into the lawsuit black hole, it's possible Apple will eventually institute some sort of policy that lets people use iTunes to go back to a previous OS if they so choose.

Last month, after reading about it on TechCrunch, I downloaded and tried Earthscape, a program for the iPhone that mimicked much of what the wonderful Google Earth does on traditional computer. Unfortunately, I found it to be a disappointment – it was slow and hard to use. It left me pining for a real Google Earth on the iPhone, and I deleted it.Sunday, my desire for the real thing was fulfilled. Google Earth was released for the iPhone, and it’s a spectacular app that you’ll want immediately.As with the desktop version, you begin with the Earth floating in space. Tapping on the image zooms in, and you can use the pinching gesture to more precisely zoom in and out.Continue to tap, and you’ll eventually be down to street level.Google Earth uses the accelerometer in the iPhone to let you move around on the map, or angle it for a horizon view.As with Google Maps on the iPhone, it works with the device’s GPS. Tapping the locator icon in the lower left-hand corner of the screen takes you to your current location, indicated by the familiar blue dot.Google Earth for the desktop features multiple layers, so you can overlay information on top of the maps. For now, there are only two layers in the iPhone version. You an get Wikipedia information for a specific location if the appropriate article has been geo-tagged. There don’t seem to be too many of these, but perhaps the release of this software will encourage authors to geotag more Wikipedia entries.And see the little blue squares in the screen shots above? Those are where photos have been tagged with location data in Panaramio, a site designed to link images with spots on the globe. Tapping on one of the squares brings up an image at that location.Google Earth for iPhone duplicates some of the features in the Google Maps application, such as being able to search for local businesses. The two are semi-linked – you can tap on a location in Google Earth and go to the same spot in Google Maps, but not vice versa. To get back to Google Earth, it must re-launch, a downside of Apple not allowing apps to run in the background on the iPhone.There are a few annoyances. The accelerometer is sensitive, and easy for the screen to "drift" away from the view you want. Fortunately, you can turn off this feature. Also, Google Earth starts with the globe view every time it starts, then slowly zooms back down to the vicinity of your last location. This gets old quickly.Finally, because it uses your phone’s GPS, your battery level takes a beating – particularly since this app is so much fun, you’ll spend a lot of time working with it.If you’re an iPhone or iPod Touch user, you’ll want to get this application ASAP. It’s free, as you’d expect.Read more at the Google Earth blog. I also like Harry McCracken’s review at Technologizer.

Apple said its iPhone, iPad and Mac computers collect location information, but do so anonymously in batches and encrypt it before sending the data over a WiFi connection from the devices to Apple's servers every 12 hours.The normally super-secretive company shed light on its data collection practices for location-based services in a July 12 letter, responding to a list of questions from U.S. Reps. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Joe L. Barton (R-Texas).The Congressmen June 24 sent Apple a letter demanding to know about the company's practice of collecting, storing and sharing the location of users' mobile devices.Apple June 21 changed its iTunes privacy policy to reflect how it collects data about the location of Apple devices consumers purchase.Apple, which will not let users download any applications from the iTunes store without agreeing to the new terms and conditions, shares location data with application providers when consumers opt in to providers' location services.    "To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services."That policy change spurred concern among Congressmen Barton and Markey, who sentApple a list of nine questions about this practice, which is becoming more pronounced among providers of Web services.Bruce Sewell, general counsel and senior vice president of legal and government affairs for Apple, pointed out that Apple, like Google and other companies providing location-based services, uses cell tower and WiFi information to collect data from users' iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.Apple offers location-based services on the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iphone 4, iPad WiFi/3G and on older iPhones, iPad WiFi iPod touch and Macs running Snow Leopard, and Windows or Macs running the Safari 5 Web browser, albeit to a more limited extent.However, this only happens when users have toggled their device to turn the services on and only when the user runs an application requiring location information.At that point the device "intermittently and anonymously collects cell tower and WiFi access point information from the access points it can see, along with the device's GPS coordinates if available."Web services that leverage location such as Google Latitude, Google Buzz, Twitter Foursquare and Gowalla are becoming increasingly popular among users. Google, Yahoo and Bing are negotiating with Foursquare to use its location-based check-in data in their core search results.The Congressmen nodded to this fact and appreciated Apple's detailed response."As more Americans rely on location-based services as part of their everyday lives, it is imperative that consumers have control over how their personal information is used, transmitted and stored," Markey wrote."Apple's responses provided additional information about how it uses location data and the ability of consumers to exercise control over a variety of features on Apple's products, and I appreciate the company's response."He added that he was satisfied that Apple adequately lets users grant or withhold consent in their usage of Apple products, adding that consumer consent is the key to assessing the adequacy of privacy protections."Our personal information has moved from our wallets and home filing cabinets, to the file cabinets of data brokers and online files of behavioral advertisers and now, directly to the Internet cloud from our mobile devices. Consumers must be made aware of this collection and they must consent to giving it up."Barton did admonish Apple for writing privacy policies "that run on for pages and pages," which most people won't bother to read.

George Hotz (aka Geohot), the developer who had released popular jailbreaking and unlocking tools like blackra1n, blacksn0w has published a new blog post to report that he has jailbroken iPhone 4.In April, there were speculations that Geohot will release an untethered jailbreak for iPhone OS 3.1.3 and iOS 4 called limera1n as he had bought a domain. Geohot had taken part in Nuit Du Hack conference held in Paris at the end of June, where he mentioned that he had found a new bootrom exploit, which can ultimately pwn all iPhones for life, including iPhone 4. He has named this exploit as pwned4life.Geohot talks about jailbreaking iPhone 4, limera1n and pwned4life in his blog post:Got one of these in the mail today and figured I’d give it a shot. As far as a release goes, it probably won’t happen from me. limera1n is little more than a raindrop on a website; it was never mentioned by me previous to this post. pwned4life is a complete invention of some blogger in a basement somewhere. When I said pwned for life, I was referring to the original iPhone, 3G, and Touch; which of course are, by the aptly named PwnageTool. Again, please don’t ask for release dates. Every person that does makes me want to release a little bit less.Another Developer, Comex had also announced  a Userland jailbreak which is ready for the iPhone 4 ( expected after iOS 4.01 / 4.1 release).Stay tuned for more jailbreak and unlocking info by following us on Twitter and/or subscribing to our RSS feeds.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Scores of iPhone 5 users hit Apple's support forums over the past week to exchange anecdotal reports on a scary bug: Their phones appeared to be sucking down cellular data even when they were connected to a Wi-Fi network, resulting in big overages as they blew through their monthly data caps.Apple hasn't publicly commented on how widespread the bug is, but the company confirmed its existence on Sunday when it pushed out a software update aimed at fixing it for customers on Verizon's network.The software update "resolves an issue in which, under certain circumstances, iPhone 5 may use Verizon cellular data while the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network," Apple wrote in a posting on its support website.Verizon Wireless customers "will not be charged for any unwarranted cellular data usage," a company spokesman told CNNMoney on Monday. The company declined to comment further on the issue.It's unclear if carriers beyond Verizon (VZ, Fortune 500) are also affected. Some on Apple's discussion board have reported similar problems on AT&T's network.Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) and AT&T (T, Fortune 500) did not reply to requests for comment on the issue. A Sprint (S, Fortune 500) spokeswoman said CNNMoney's call late Friday was the first time the company had heard of the issue.Sporadic reports of slow, inconsistent and buggy Wi-Fi connections have plagued Apple's iOS 6 -- the operating system that powers the iPhone 5 -- since its release 12 days ago, but the cell-data problem adds a nasty new twist to the issue. Carriers are using carrots and sticks to move customers away from unlimited data and toward metered billing plans that cap customers' data use and charge them for overages. Any bugs in how data use is charged will hit customers hard on their monthly bills.As one customer on Apple's board put it: "When I first noticed the issue, I actually felt sick."Two CNNMoney readers said their problems appear to be with the iOS 6 software, not the iPhone hardware -- and they indicated that it's a problem on AT&T's network, too.Gary Milkis said his daughter's iPhone 4 (which had been upgraded to iOS 6) experienced the data glitch, and that he was forced to shut off cellular data to avoid overage charges. AT&T retroactively increased the data limit for last month to make up for the overage, he said.Another reader, Frank Passalacqua, said AT&T recently informed him that he had gone over his 200 MB monthly data limit."This comes as a shock to me because in the two years I had my plan, I never once went over. The funny thing is, I got this message from them the day after I downloaded iOS 6," he wrote in an email. "I just don't think it's right that I'm being charged an extra $15 for going over when I know for a fact I didn't."A long trail of iPhone 5 users have posted messages on Apple's website expressing surprise at how quickly they seem to be hitting their caps."I somehow managed to burn up 1.8gb of data over 5 days on my iphone 5," user Malc Mitch wrote last week on one Apple discussion board. "This had never happened in my past 4 years of owning an iPhone ... I can't believe I'm about to hit my full months data limit in 6 days when I connected to wifi 75% of the day."Commenters on many other threads reported similar problems."My son's phone used 161 MB of data in one setting while he was in class and on the Wi-Fi network," Apple customer Curtis Sandberg wrote in an email to CNNMoney on Friday. "I'm hoping that Apple will acknowledge and respond to the issue."Apple has already issued one mea culpa about the iPhone 5. CEO Tim Cook released a public apology on Friday in response to widespread complaints about Apple's new Maps app, which "fell short" of Apple's commitment to "make world-class products," Cook said.

A day after President Barack Obama won a second term, stocks suffered their worst beating in nearly a year. Late selling caused to the $INDU ) to finish down more than 300 points, its largest loss since Nov. 9, 2011. The blue-chip index ended the day below 13,000 for the first time since Aug. 2, and the major U.S. averages were all down at least 2.4%. Bank stocks were the weakest sector in part because it's likely the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill will remain largely intact. In addition, Elizabeth Warren, a critic of many U.S. banking practices, won a seat in the U.S. Senate. JPM ), a critic of bank regulation, was down $2.32 to $40.56. Health insurance stocks were lower because the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Reform Act -- aka Obamacare -- is likely to stay in place.Meanwhile, oil prices fell back sharply in part because of worries about global demand. Europe became a worry after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said he expected no change to the weak eurozone economy in the near future. Worse, he said, the weakness has begun to affect Germany. European stocks immediately sold off -- and sharply, too. The dollar rose against the euro and British pound.

...or can they? In case Apple has somehow managed to perfect the art of selective disremembrance across a wide population, here's a refresher: Consumer Reports has thrown down the gauntlet, stating that it "can't recommend" the iPhone 4 until the antenna issues are fixed, issues that its labs and ours have verified quite substantially . Apple apparently isn't happy about that, and has taken to deleting threads about the Consumer Reports article from its support forums. Now, Apple deleting threads from its support forums is nothing new; outside of "regular" moderation, the company routinely deletes discussion of hardware flaws that it's not ready to 'fess up to, or just generally negative lines of thought about its products. Good thing the internet's a big place, and if Apple's not going to admit the antenna issue, there are plenty of ways to gripe about it. Feel free to express yourself in the comments below, for instance!

After all the hubbub and controversy caused by the release of SingPlayer for iPhone back in May, we knew it would take a serious change of heart for AT&T to reverse course on the issue of 3G streaming . The app's super-conspicuous lack of 3G was one of the clearest statements around that the iPhone represented a level of data consumption that AT&T was fairly unprepared for, and that certain uses like VoIP over 3G and live video streams were just not going to fly. Well, we've just now gotten over that VoIP hump , and now AT&T has given in to SlingPlayer demand at last. AT&T says it has been testing an "optimized" version of the app on its 3G network since December, and Sling says the dynamic bandwidth adjustment should keep the app from bringing the network to grinding halt -- in not so many words. The 3G-friendly version will be a free upgrade to the $30 application, and should be available as soon as the revised software makes its way through the App Store approval process.

In yet another episode in the seemingly endless saga of consumer tech companies trying to impact on each other’ smartphone and tablet sales, Apple has been forced to stop selling its iPhone 4 and the iPad 2 in Germany. This time, the appellant was Motorola. The issue at stake is an unresolved patent licence relating to the GPRS module. A German court has ruled that the Apple smartphone and tablet cannot be sold through retail channels in the country until the patent issue is resolved. The iPhone 4S uses a Qualcomm chip and is thus exempt from the ban.Apple has also been in dispute with Samsung over alleged similarities between the design of the original Apple iPad and the similarly slim Samsung Galaxy Tab.Tech site The Verge relays details of a report in German newspaper Finanz Nachrichten in which Apple says “Even if some iPad and iPhone models currently available in our online store in Germany are removed, our customers will have no problem finding these products in Apple stores or through authorised dealers.”The spokesperson went on to say that Apple will appeal against the injunction as Motorola has refused to license the patent “on acceptable terms” and that the disputed module was declared an indusntrial patent 7 years ago.”

Digg's Kevin Rose has a solid (but far from perfect ) track record when it comes to Apple rumors, and he just drove the nerds of SXSWi crazy with his latest gaze into the crystal ball: he says the iPhone 3.0 will have copy and paste. Kev says that the interface is much like the magnifying glass -- you use two fingers to select the text you want, and then you can cut or copy. Sure, that's great, but we think the bigger news is that Rose says 3.0 won't have support for background apps -- which makes his claim that that 3.0 will bring the iPhone "up to speed with the Palm Pre" a little suspect. We'll find out what's what in just a few days , but in the meantime check the video of Rose after the break.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has underlined his love for Android handsets, stating his gripes with the iPhone and why in many ways he prefers Google's OS.He even claimed voice commands worked better on Android, as does the GPS system, the Daily Beast reports.“My primary phone is the iPhone, I love the beauty of it. But I wish it did all the things my Android does, I really do,” said Woz.“If you’re willing to do the work to understand it a little bit, well I hate to say it, but there’s more available in some ways.”Woz feels the battle between Apple and Android is reminiscent of the rivalry between Windows and Macintosh during the 1990s, when Microsoft dominated the market after licensing its software to third-party manufacturers. The theory goes that Android is doing the same to Apple, slowly taking over through sheer volume.Unfortunately for the Cupertino giant, Woz reckons it is up against a stronger competitor this time.“There’s not as big a difference [between iOS and Android] as there was between Mac and Windows,” he said before highlighting Apple's strict app approval process as a hindrance that may give the edge to Android.While Apple has worked hard to promote Siri, its voice-recognition-based assistant for iPhone 4S, Woz stressed his disappointment with it.“I have a lower success rate with Siri than I do with the voice built into the Android," he blurted before stating his view that Android is "way ahead on navigation" and slating the iPhone's battery life.Woz does still recommend the iPhone as the best choice for most, though, redeeming his gripes in the eyes of fanboys.“The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it’s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don’t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person, who is scared of complexity, well, here’s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do.”Ooh, that was a close one, Woz. ®

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureiPhone users expecting their Passcode Lock to prevent thieves running up their bill will be disappointed, as it emerges that the "Emergency Call" button actually allows any number to be dialled.While most users are happy to keylock their iPhone with the sliding finger, some opt to configure a passcode to lock the device more effectively - suffering the inconvenience of entering their PIN every time they use the phone. But while that process will protect data on the device (unlike last time) it won't stop a pickpocket running up your phone bill by making calls to any number.But it neglects to define what numbers constitute an emergency, and it turns out that, in the UK at least, the user is permitted to call anyone they wish.This could be described as a feature - one man's emergency is another's routine call - but we can't help wondering if the typical user is really aware of this particular feature, or if the manual could have been a bit more explicit in stating that someone experiencing an emergency is free to call on support from anywhere. ®

One-Third of iPhone Users Mistakenly Think They Have 4G new survey from Retrevo Maybe the "4" in the iPhone 4 name gives iPhone owners (34%) the false impression that they already own a 4G phone but the fact is Apple doesn't offer a 4G phone at the moment. Coincidentally, a suspiciously large percentage of Android and BlackBerry owners may be suffering from the same delusion. BlackBerry owners (24%) are almost as confused as iPhone owners since RIM doesn't currently offer a 4G phone. At least some Android owners could be answering correctly as Android 4G phones like the HTC Evo 4G or Samsung Infuse 4G have been available for some time. If nothing else this large number of "misinformed" phone owners serves to emphasize the fact that consumers are quite confused about 4G. technically make the iPhone a 4G deviceOne-Third of iPhone Users Mistakenly Think They Have 4G According to a new survey from Retrevo , 34% of iPhone users are under the mistaken impression that they already have "4G" cellular technology on their devices, highlighting the confusion that has resulted from shifting definitions of just what constitutes "4G" speeds.Confusing the issue is the fact that the marketing term "4G" is now being used to apply to not only the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology being rolled out by Verizon and other carriers but also HSPA+ networks such as those run by AT&T and T-Mobile. In addition, carriers running HSPA+ and LTE network won't necessarily all be offering the same speeds for a given standard, resulting in a spectrum of data speeds for consumers to compare. Apple is not expected to offer LTE support in the next-generation iPhone, but has been said to be supporting HSPA+, which would technically make the iPhone a 4G device on GSM carriers that support the HSPA+ standard. But consumers appear willing to embrace the next iPhone even if it doesn't have 4G capabilities, with 40% of current iPhone owners stating they will be buying the next iPhone even without 4G and an additional 21% stating that they would consider purchasing it. Significant percentages of current Android and BlackBerry owners are also registering interest in the next iPhone, with or without 4G.

The iPhone 4 's massive launch hasn't been blemish free, with reports of spotty displays (which seem to have disappeared) and antenna woes being rather widely reported. Well -- it looks like it's possible there's another issue too -- this time with the proximity sensor. Now, we're no strangers to spontaneously turning on speakerphone with our faces (though admittedly our cheeks are pretty round), so it's hard to say if this is an iPhone 4-specific issue, but the mounting reports would suggest that it's possible the new handsets sensor is a little bit... over sensitive. Reported issues include accidentally disconnecting calls, throwing the speakerphone switch, and putting people on hold accidentally. What about you? Are you having problems with your iPhone 4's proximity sensor? Let us know in the comments.

Last month, I wrote about two different Reddit applications for the iPhone, neither one actually made by the social voting site. While both were pretty good, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian clearly thought an official one could do a bit better — so they made one.Due to hit the App Store shortly, iReddit has all the features you’d expect from a Reddit iPhone app: voting, commenting and the ability to switch to different sub-Reddits. It also has some features the other Reddit apps didn’t have, such as the ability to easily switch between “Hot,” “New,” “Top,” and “Controversial” stories in any category — these classifications are a staple of the main Reddit site. This app also features story thumbail pictures (an option that can be toggled off as well).iReddit also has a unique flair that makes some iPhone apps stand out. For example, while the app is pretty fast, it loads all the stories’ actual websites through the app’s web browser, and it can take a bit of time for some of those page to load. So Ohanian chose to use that load time to me a quirky Reddit alient page load overlay (see the video below).But better is iReddits “shake for a new story” feature. Ohanian notes that the inspiration from this came form another great iPhone app, UrbanSpoon. That app works by giving your restaurant recommendations when you shake the iPhone thanks to the device’s accelerometer. iReddit has an option to use an iPhone shake to load what’s called “Serendipity” mode. A Star Wars lightsaber-like sound lets you know you’re entering it, and a big red “Serendipity” banner across the top lets you know that you’re in the mode.While in Serendipity mode, you will keep getting fed random stories to view/vote on every time you hit the “Hit me”  button or shake the iPhone. Clicking “No More!!!” will take you back to regular mode. Much like UrbanSpoon, I could see this Serendipity mode becoming addicting. It’s a bit like a completely random StumbleUpon (a website discovery tool), but again, using the iPhone’s accelerometer.Such a feature seems perfect for a social voting site, where users are often looking for new and interesting stories. The biggest of these sites, Digg, still does not have a native iPhone app.iReddit is fast, solid and yet quirky enough to stand above the other third-party Reddit apps. My only complaint is a minor one: that you can’t see the Reddit vote counts without clicking on a story. I’ve also had some issues loading the site’s custom Reddits, but the developers are aware of the issue and are looking into it.iReddit should be available soon in the App Store for $1.99 — cheaper than Satellite, the better of the twounofficial Reddit apps, which is $4.99, but more expensive than the one previously known as “reddit” but now called “open source reddit,” which is free. But I’m told that a free version of iReddit which is ad-supported will be made available in the next month or two as well.

AT&T is circulating a survey among some of its longer-term iPhone users with a checklist of features they'd like to see. It's a follow-up to a similar survey a few months back, and apparently also serves to judge reactions to the 2.1 firmware. Some of the most regular complaints make the list, including picture messaging through MMS, landscape mode for email, a user-replaceable battery, and the all-mighty cut and paste. The survey probably doesn't imply any kind of imminent changes, but it's nice to hear that AT&T is trying to listen to what we've all been screaming for so long. [ AppleInsider

Apple's homegrown processors in their iOS devices are pretty awesome, able to outperform—and in some cases, blow away—other mobile chipsets. Jim Keller, one of the men largely responsible for that feat, is leaving. Where is he going? AMD. Ouch.According to 9to5mac, Keller was an employee at PA Semi when the company was acquired by Apple, and while at Apple, was listed as "A4/A5 Designer & K8 Lead Architect." Of course, what makes this all the more intriguing is that Keller was hired by and will work under Mark Papermaster, a former iPhone employee who was dismissed after the whole Antennagate debacle came to light in 2010. Regardless your feelings about AMD, you can't deny that they now have two very talented employees. [9to5mac]

Apple (AAPL) launched the fastest-selling smartphone in history in late September and the company went on to post a record September quarter, during which it earned $8.2 billion in profit on $36 billion in sales. The company also issued impressive guidance for the holiday quarter, anticipating a record $52 billion in revenue. Since Apple’s stock hit a record high when the iPhone 5 launched, however, it has lost more than $130 billion in market value — closing at $558 on Wednesday, down nearly 21% since late September. Why is Apple’s stock tanking as the company continues to break record after record? Wall Street.As dominant as Apple is right now, Wall Street analysts continue to issue sky-high estimates that hammer the company when it can’t meet them. This is the game we play, of course, and while Apple’s stock soared when it was regularly beating estimates, it is now heading back down to Earth as analysts adjusted by raising expectations even further.When Apple only pulled in $8.2 billion in profit last quarter, it was a miss. And when the company only sold 3 million iPads during the iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad’s opening weekend, it was a miss. Now, a number of analysts are pushing the stock down further — DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach, for example, sent shares of Apple down further when he went on CNBC and said Apple’s stock is headed to $425.Even analysts that will remain bullish on Apple until the day it dissolves are inadvertently contributing to the stock’s tumble. When Apple sold a record 5 million iPhone 5 handset during the phone’s debut weekend, the company’s stock slipped because Apple bulls like Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster were calling for opening-weekend sales to reach as high as 10 million units.Will Wall Street lead to Apple’s ultimate demise? Is it even the Street’s fault or is Apple done innovating? Apple may very well be in decline, but beginning to panic in the midst what is shaping up to be the biggest quarter in history for a consumer electronics company may be somewhat premature, especially when most analysts’ fiscal 2013 estimates remain sky-high.

When Steve Jobs first dreamed up the iPhone with his team at Apple, he didn't want it to run on AT&T's network. He wanted to create his own network.So says Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Stanton, who spent a good deal of time with the late Apple CEO during the phone's development period. Jobs wanted to replace carriers completely, Stanton says, instead using the unlicensed spectrum that WiFi operates on for his phone."He and I spent a lot of time talking about whether synthetically you could create a carrier using WiFi spectrum," Stanton said on Monday at the Law Seminar International Event in Seattle. "That was part of his vision."Both WiFi and cellular frequencies belong on the ultra-high-frequency level of the radio frequency spectrum. WiFi takes up five channels of the 2.4 GHz band. Other frequency bands are allotted to various purposes and cellular providers by the FCC.Jobs gave up his plans to create his own network in 2007, ultimately settling on a deal with AT&T.When Jobs debuted the iPhone, it marked a huge change in the way phone makers and carriers developed a device. Jobs sold AT&T Apple's iPhone sight unseen. Previously, carriers were an integral part of device development, adding tweaks, features and software throughout the process. Not so with the iPhone. Apple orchestrated the entire phone experience, while AT&T was simply afforded the opportunity to sell it. Android and other major mobile phone platforms followed this model with their smartphones later on, though to a lesser degree.It's not outrageous to think Jobs and Stanton spoke candidly about network matters, given Stanton's long history with wireless carriers. He was the first employee at McCaw Cellular, the national wireless provider that later became AT&T Wireless. He started another firm called Western Wireless, which birthed an operator called Voicestream that was bought out by Deutsche Telekom and became T-Mobile.I'd be interested to find out what sort of challenges Apple encountered trying to develop and get a phone to work properly just on the WiFi spectrum. The company certainly could have just bought out an existing carrier with its billions in the bank. Either option must have been too costly or provided too little pay-off to make it worthwhile.

AT&T has apparently found a workable solution to the reported data congestion in New York City. They’ve quietly stopped selling the iPhone from their web site to customers in the New York metropolitan area.I guess that’s one way to solve the problem.Reader Stephen in Brooklyn made the discovery while shopping for a new phone today.I was on the AT&T Wireless website trying to get an iPhone. However, when I put in my zip code 11231, the site says the iPhone is unavailable. This seemed a little odd so I started punching in other famous zip codes: 90210, 60609 (spiegel catalog), 02134 (zoom, an old children’s show). For theses cities, LA, Chicago, Boston, iPhone is available. Then I looked up some other zip codes: Dallas, Miami, St. Louis, Philadelphia, San Francisco. All those cities are ok. Then I started putting in more NYC zip codes: midtown, Staten Island, the Bronx…no iPhone available. This is weird…AT&T has cut off New York City.I went to the AT&T site to verify what Stephen said. Sure enough, the iPhone was available to zip codes in San Francisco and other major cities. It was not available to purchase for people living anywhere in New York City, or any of the suburban zip codes in Westchester County or northern New Jersey that I tried. Was it a web site bug? I hopped online with a customer service chat rep to check.Daphne: Welcome to AT&T online Sales support. How may I assist you with placing your order today? Laura: Hi, I was looking at the iPhone 3Gs and the system tells me that I cannot order one in my ZIP code. My zip code is 11231. (Brooklyn, NY) Is this true? Are iPhones no longer available in New York City? Daphne: I am happy to be helping you today . Yes, this is correct the phone is not offered to you because New York is not ready for the iPhone. Daphne: You don’t have enough towers to handle the phone. Laura: Thank you for your help. So the phone is not available to people anywhere in the city? Daphne: Yes this is correct Laura.The iPhone is still available in Apple ant AT&T stores in and around New York CIty. Just not online. Why?Update 1: In a written statement, AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook told Consumerist that “We periodically modify our promotions and distribution channels.” We have requested additional details, and will add them when and if they become available.Update 2 (12/28/09): New York customers are now able to order iPhones via AT&T’s Web site. It would appear that the company has once more modified its “promotions and distribution channels.” We’ve requested a statement from AT&T, and will update this post it if and when we receive it.Is the iPhone available for sale where you live, online or in stores? Let us know in the comments, or e-mail tips@consumerist.com.RELATED: AT&T Network Struggling In iPhone-Dense Urban Areas Call Drop Rate For iPhones In NYC Is 30%, Says Apple Genius Why Do iPhone Owners Hate AT&T So Much?

Xbox SmartGlass for Android and iPhone will be coming in early 2013, Microsoft has told us, following a demo of the innovative service on Windows 8. SmartGlass was first demonstrated back at E3 in June 2012.Xbox SmartGlass will give you expanded control and integration with your Xbox 360 from your smart device. It's going to be available across Microsoft's platforms (Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT) from launch, before landing on other platforms in early 2013.UPDATE: It looks like the Android app has already arrived, you can read about it here.SmartGlass will give you the ability to use your phone as a controller as long as you are on the same network as your console, a function already available through the My Xbox Live companion app on iPhone (pictured above).Although Microsoft is yet to show SmartGlass on all these platforms, we do have some screens from Xbox SmartGlass for Android, iPhone and iPad in the gallery below. We've included a screen from the Android and iPhone apps just below, so you know what to expect.SmartGlass will allow control over movies and music, moving playback from one device to another, so you can pause on your tablet and resume on your Xbox, back on the big screen. It will also allow your mobile device to act as a second screen for things like movies and music, providing information on actors or artists.This second-screen experience extends to supported games: for example, it will provide a GPS map for Forza Horizon or let you line up the next track for Dance Central 3, we have been told.It will act as a remote for the new Xbox Internet Explorer browser, so you can zoom using pinch on your display.Xbox SmartGlass will be available in Windows 8, which launches on 26 October and Windows Phone 8, launching 29 October, initially. You will need an Xbox Live Gold subscription for some SmartGlass features to work and we're not certain exactly which features Android and iOS users will get.Once we've got firm dates for SmartGlass on other platforms, we'll bring you all the details.

Reddit, owned by Conde Nast (who also happens to own Ars Technica and Wired.com), is one of the popular social news website on the internet. So, if you are an avowed lurker at Reddit, like me, then an app for your iOS device can be helpful to budge through the popular /r sections wherever you go.iReddit is the official Reddit app for the iPhone, iPad and the iPod touch, and is fairly good at what it does. However, the frequent crashes, freezing, and no support for the app can be disappointing. Perhaps, that’s where the unofficial Reddit app comes into play.The app is “Alien blue,” which is free to download and works with the 3.x and the new iOS 4.0+ firmware. What makes this app better than the official is, of course, the easy to use interface and navigation available at the tap of a button. The main page is nifty, well organized with theme selection feature and added support for multiple user login is enough to jolt the Redditors.Alien blue app lets you select different themes by changing the appearance, allows you to tweak the settings, upvote (umm… downvote) posts and edit the comments. In short: Alien blue culminates into an impressive app that turns out to be much better than the iReddit.So, if you are intrigued by this short review, then check out the app (I am not affiliated with Alien blue) by visiting the iTunes page, or searching for “Alien blue” right from your Apple device. Yes, they do have a Pro version, but the free one does the job, actually a very good job!Edit: Thanks for the love, Reddit! And yes, for those of you who are using iPad, Alien blue isn’t free to download, but it is totally worth it ($1.99).

Nielsen's just released a study confirming what some other studies have already concluded -- that Android devices account for the single largest swath of smartphone users in the US, with 39 percent OS share as of the second quarter. That compares with 28 percent for iOS, although Apple still reigns as the country's top-selling device maker. Simply put, that's a reflection of the fact that Apple is the only outfit churning out iOS devices, whereas a bevy of companies led by HTC, Motorola, and Samsung have helped make Android the dominant OS in the states. And let's not forget about RIM, another hardware / software shop, which still commands a 20 percent chunk of the market. Rounding out the list, Windows Phone and Windows Mobile account for nine percent, largely thanks to sales of HTC handsets, while webOS and Symbian each eked out two percent. At this point we don't doubt that Android is the most ubiquitous mobile operating system this side of the Atlantic, although it's worth noting that Nielsen based its results on a sample of roughly 20,000 people -- all of whom are postpaid subscribers.

In August 2008, Apple approved an application in the App Store called I Am Rich. The app did nothing beyond show a picture of a red gem. So why was it notable? Because it cost $999.99. Though Apple pulled it relatively quickly, there was some concern that we'd start to see a rush of bogus applications and/or huge prices in the App Store. Luckily, that didn't happen and app prices have remained low (some would say too low). But now we have the return of a $999.99 app.But there's a big difference with this app; BarMax CA actually does something. And to the people it's aimed towards, it's likely to be very useful. And quite possibly worth the $1,000 price tag.BarMax CA is an application to help law students preparing for the bar exam. The reason the price is justified is because the company that is synonymous with this type of test prep, BarBri, typically offers it for $3,000 to $4,000. BarMax CA believes it can get away with the lower price because it's just an app, there is no in-class element. Also, there has been some questions about BarBri's pricing structure and anti-competitive behavior, which has been the subject of multiple class action lawsuits (hardly surprising when you're selling these packages to future lawyers).BarBri also offers an iPhone application, and it's free, but you need to enroll in their program to access it otherwise it's useless.So what do you get for your $1,000 BarMax CA app? A lot, actually. The app is over 1 gigabyte in size, which is the largest application I've ever seen. It includes thousands of pages of materials as well as hundreds of hours of audio lectures. It's all the information you could ever want for the two-month course. And again, it can be done all on your iPhone. That said, if you do want some more tangible paperwork for certain sections, BarMax will send you that electronically as well.The bar exam consists of three main parts: Multiple choice, essays, and a performance test. There is also an ethics exam you have to take. As you can probably tell by the name, BarMax CA is meant for the California bar exam. But by the end of 2010, the company expects to have apps available for New York, and the five other most popular states for the exam as well. There will also be a multi-state version since much of the test (the multiple choice part, for example) doesn't vary state to state. Each of these apps would cost the same $999.99 but there is also a plan to make an app with just the multiple choice part for $500.Mike Ghaffary came up with the idea when he himself was preparing for the bar exam. He could not believe BarBri charged the $4,000 to send him an iPod with audio notes on it, and that there was no real competition in the space. So he got in touch with some successful iPhone app developers in Los Angeles, as well as some fellow Harvard Law graduates to create the app. Ghaffary, who is the director of business development at TrialPay by day, is serving as an advisor now to the team.How this app sells will be interesting to say the least. Ghaffary confirmed that it is the most expensive app in the App Store, surpassing a home security app that sells for $899. Many iPhone developers have complained about a race to the bottom for app prices, but a few have tried to sell more expensive applications, such as Wolfram Alpha. But that $50 app doesn't really give you anything you can't get on its website, it just dresses the data up to look nicer on the iPhone. BarMax CA, again, is attempting to save law students thousands of dollars. It's a good experiment, if nothing else.Ghaffary notes that while Apple was extra careful in checking BarExam CA out due to the high price, they had no problems getting it approved, and Apple generally seemed pleased with the idea.Still, the thought of being able to spend $1,000 with one click on your iPhone remains a little terrifying. Find the app here.

The Quip app promised to let people send pictures to each other for free — like sending a multimedia message but without any fees.What it didn't say was that anyone with a few web skills could see them as well.Quip stored the private images on a publicly accessible web server without any encryption, making them easy prey for savvy internet users.Now some of the most intimate moments of thousands of people are being circulated on web forums.Many photos show people posing nude or having sex. Others show a day at the baseball or baby shots.One image shows a man naked from the waist up and seemingly covered in cuts and blood. Another seems to have been taken inside the White House.Some internet users have also allegedly matched up nude photos with real names and Facebook profiles.On one web forum, a user identifying as one of the makers of the Quip app said the system had been shut down."Hello, this is Ish, the founder of Addy Mobile, makers of the Quip app," said "ish_addy" on Reddit."As soon as this post came to our attention, we immediately shut down our servers. We have also now disabled all S3 access and have started to systematically secure all files in the system."We will not bring the system back up until we have adequate security around all files shared over Quip."However many of the photos, saved by people before the servers were shut down, are still being circulated.

An iPhone bug already seen when Australia switched between Daylight Savings Time and Standard Time a few weeks ago has now hit Europe. Twitter just lit up with reports of recurring iPhone alarms going off an hour later than usual. So even though the iOS clock changed correctly over the weekend, the alarm did not. Thing is, according to a ZDNet Australia report from more than three weeks ago, Apple acknowledged the bug with a promise to fix it with a software update. So why wasn't it rolled out in time to avoid this mess in Europe? Let's see if Apple fixes it before North America makes the switch on November 7th, otherwise, you've been warned.Deleting and re-adding the alarms will NOT fix the issue. We've now tested a number of scenarios under iOS 4.1 on European iPhone 4 and 3GS devices for ourselves. The bug (demoed on video after the break by Roman ) appears when using a repeating alarm for anything other than "every day." So for example, your alarm will go off an hour late if it's set for "weekdays," or "weekends," or every "Monday." The following alarms are not affected by the bug: You can test yourself by creating a repeating alarm (but not every day) to go off one minute in the future and 59 minutes in the past.: Some US readers are now waking up to alarms reportedly going off an hour early [Thanks, David O. and Matthieu Di B.]

News of a successful attack that almost instantly gives full access to an iPhone's password keychain made its way around the Web on Thursday after Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology revealed the exploit to IDG News Service. While the fact that hackers could access a device's keychain in such a short time certainly sounds alarming, the attack isn't entirely new, and is actually a product of Apple's "DRM approach" to security, one iOS security expert told Ars.Fraunhofer SIT's exploit first relies on physical access to an iPhone, so an attacker has to get your iPhone away from you before digging in. In most cases like this, you would likely want to use Apple's (now free) remote wipe feature in order to protect your data, but remote wipe is easily thwarted by removing the device's SIM card. Any attacker sophisticated enough to decrypt the keychain will know this trick.Once an attacker has your phone, he could use any of the commonly available jailbreaks to install an SSH server, install a keychain hacking script, and collect the decrypted password information.Part of what makes the attack relatively trivial is that the cryptographic key used for the keychain is stored on the iPhone. Once a device is jailbroken, hackers can use iOS's built-in APIs to access and decrypt certain passwords—including those for network access and e-mail accounts—stored in the keychain. From there, passwords from VPN access or e-mail accounts can be further used to gain more passwords, or e-mail accounts can be used to request password resets for a number of online services.But while Fraunhofer SIT's particular methods may be new, accessing the keychain and other encrypted information on a jailbroken iPhone has been possible for some time. iPhone forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski told Ars that similar exploits have been around since about the time of the introduction of the iPhone 3G."Several dev teams have been able to easily deduce Apple's encryption keys for the keychain; it just hasn't been widely advertised," Zdziarski said. The "new" part of Fraunhofer SIT's attack, however, leverages Apple's APIs to access the keychain instead of other methods.The real problem, according to Zdziarski, is that Apple hasn't yet fully implemented a truly secure environment for iOS. "Apple has—since introducing encryption—been relying on their DRM know-how, and just erasing the label that says 'DRM' and calling it 'security,'" he explained. "The problem with this is that DRM only makes things a little more difficult for hackers.""Real security relies on the strength of the key, and the secrecy of the key," Zdziarski continued. "And as long as the keys are all stored on the iPhone and don't rely on a user password, they can easily be compromised."In other words, even while Apple has continually improved the security of information on iPhones and other iDevices, the same types of flaws that enable moderately skilled hackers to access an entire unencrypted disk image of an iPhone still exist. And while Apple offers APIs for developers to add an additional layer of encryption for user data, it's up to developers to implement it independently.Zdziarski said that he believes Apple is pushing to make the iPhone compliant with security standards set forth in Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). When that happens, government and enterprise users can be less wary about iPhone security issues. "But at the end of the day," he said, "Apple will need to abandon their DRM approach if they want true security, as opposed to just some fancy marketing strategies."

Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota) has called upon Apple and Google to participate in a hearing with the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law in order to discuss consumer privacy. The hearing will take place May 10 at 10 a.m. EDT in Washington, where witnesses from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, Center for Democracy and Technology and others will talk about what the latest mobile technology means for privacy and the law.“Recent advances in mobile technology have allowed Americans to stay connected like never before and put an astonishing number of resources at our fingertips,” Franken said in a statement. “But the same technology that has given us smartphones, tablets and cell phones has also allowed these devices to gather extremely sensitive information about users, including detailed records of their daily movements and location. This hearing is the first step in making certain that federal laws protecting consumers’ privacy — particularly when it comes to mobile devices — keep pace with advances in technology.”Device privacy has been an increasingly important topic to lawmakers in recent years, but discussion came to a head last week when two researchers revealed that the iPhone and 3G iPad keep a log file of every location the user has ever been, whether the iOS Location Services are turned on or not. The discovery was neither new nor hidden (and it turns out Google also does some level of location logging as well), but the announcement sparked a deeper look into how technology companies track and store our personal data.Franken was the first to fire off a letter to Apple over the news, followed by Representative Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts). Both demanded answers about why Apple collects the data, how it’s generated, whether users can disable the location logging and so on.Neither Apple nor Google have publicly acknowledged Franken’s call for a hearing just yet, and the companies did not respond to our request for comment by publication time. It’s in both of the companies’ better interest to attend, though, lest they want the DOJ, FTC, CDT and others to begin making plans for possible legislation without them.Photo: An unencrypted file stored in iPhones and iPads constantly records a user’s location data. An open source application was used to plot the location data from an iPhone belonging to a Wired.com reporter.

Sizes go up, prices fall. These are the two hallmark rules of the TV land. Just a few years ago, $800 couldn’t buy you a screen much larger ... Read moreMost folks have accepted that they'll buy new cases almost every time they upgrade their iPhones, thanks to subtle — and occasionally rather bold — design changes. But repurchasing all their accessories, including charger cables and speaker docks? That is a tougher, pricier pill to swallow.According to TechCrunch's John Biggs, we should get our credit cards ready as that shopping spree is inevitable. At the very least you'll be looking at buying an extra cable or two (currently priced at $19) and, unless there are some third-party adapters out there to ease the pain, you may also have to kiss your current speaker dock goodbye.Biggs writes that "three independent manufacturers" told him that the next-generation iPhone will use a 19-pin port, rather than the wider 30-pin port found on current iPhones, iPads and iPods. If true, this news will make life a bit difficult for third-party accessory manufacturers, who have accepted Apple's 30-pin port design as a standard "since Apple released the third-generation iPod" in 2003, writes Biggs.As skeptical as I normally am regarding reports like this one, it's actually not all that unlikely that Apple would redesign the iPhone — and subsequently iPod and iPad — ports. The 19-pin design would save valuable space, after all, and interface technology has made major advancements in 10 years.Let's not forget, the Cupertino-based company recently redesigned the MagSafe, its proprietary magnetically-attached power connector, too, and that was only around since 2006.Want more tech news, silly puns, or amusing links? You'll get plenty of all three if you keep up with Rosa Golijan, the writer of this post, by following her on Twitter, subscribing to her Facebook posts, or circling her on Google+.

After nearly a decade of rumors and speculation, Apple's finally unveiled the iPad. It's a half-inch thick and weighs just 1.5 pounds, with a 9.7-inch capacitive touchscreen IPS LCD display, and it's running a custom 1GHz Apple "A4" chip developed by the P.A. Semi team, with a 10-hour battery life and a month of standby. It'll come in 16, 32, and 64GB sizes, and it's got the expected connectivity: very little. There's a 30-pin Dock connector, a speaker, a microphone, Bluetooth, 802.11n WiFi and optional 3G, as well as an accelerometer and a compass. There's also a keyboard dock , which connects underneath in the portrait orientation, support for up to 1024x768 VGA out and 480p composite out through new dock adapter cables, and a camera attachment kit that lets you import photos from your camera over USB or directly through an SD reader. The device is managed by iTunes, just like the iPhone -- you sync everything over to your Mac. As expected, it can run iPhone apps -- either pixel-for-pixel in a window, or pixel-doubled fullscreen -- but developers can also target the new screen size using the updated iPhone OS SDK, which is available today. The 3G version runs on AT&T and comes with new data plans : 250MB for $14.99 and an unlimited plan for $29.99 a month contract-free. Activations are handled on the iPad, so you can activate and cancel whenever you want. Every iPad is unlocked and comes with a GSM "micro-SIM," so you can use it abroad, but there aren't any international deals in place right now -- Steve says they'll be back "this summer" with news on that front. It starts at $499 for 16GB, 32GB for $599, and $699 64GB. Adding 3G costs a $130 per model, so the most expensive model (64GB / 3G) is $829. The WiFi-only model will ship in 60 days, and the 3G models will come in 90.

The iPhone has been hacked in the past to use modified external keyboards, but new mods promise much more general interaction. Now, iPhone expert Ralf Ackermann has succeeded in supporting a standard Bluetooth keyboard using an external Bluetooth approach and is working on supporting an internal one.For the external approach, Ackermann modified a Robotech Bluetooth module, which he placed in an iPhone battery sleeve and connected to the iPhone (serial) connector port at the bottom of the unit. This allowed the the phone to communicate directly with the the module using the Bluetooth serial port profile.The whole thing works courtesy of Jay "saurik" Freeman's Veency application. Ackermann used a tiny libvncclient to generate keyboard events, which were then passed to Veency. Veency then provided the keyboard event injection using the iPhone's private Graphics Services framework.You can find out more about this external module project over at Ackermann's blog. He'll be posting schematics and code as he gets his site set up.Ars readers may be more excited, though, by his work on a completely internal solution. Here, Ackermann discovered BlueSn0w, part of the iBluetooth project. BlueSn0w (yes, its name is apparently inspired by the iPhone dev team's yellowsn0w) will scan for discoverable Bluetooth devices. According to this Flickr page, the module seems to enable the Bluetooth UART interface to communicateThe internal solution depends on gaining access to the Bluetooth module stack. "User space BT stacks are not common—nevertheless, of course they can be done," Ackermann told Ars. "In the past, I had a look at an adaptation of the Linux Bluez stack for ATMEL uCs for instance—and this seems similar." Once the stack becomes available, Ackermann believes a fully internal solution will be quickly usable. There is no time estimate on this due to the complete volunteer nature of the BlueSn0w project but it looks like hobbyists are drawing close to the goal.Allowing the iPhone to accept keyboard input from an external Bluetooth keyboard will move the iPhone forward in opening new opportunities for general computing and on-the-go note taking. Taking into account the iPhone's newly realized video out support, the entire platform looks like it's at the brink of a transformative revolution.

If you didn't already think your smartphone knows too much about you, here's a handy reminder. A duo of UK researchers have uncovered a potentially worrying (and oddly enough, undocumented) feature in iOS 4 : it asks your iPhone to record your location constantly, then timestamps that data and records it for posterity. The trouble with this unsolicited location tracking is that the hidden file that holds the data -- consolidated.db -- is relatively easy to uncover and read, making any desktops you've backed your phone up to and the phone itself even bigger privacy dangers than they would usually be. Some extra digging revealed this behavior has been known about for a good while (see Courbis and Alex Levinson links below), though mostly by people involved in computer forensics. Additionally, restoring a backup or migrating to a new device keeps the data logging going, which the researchers point to as evidence that what's happening isn't accidental. See a couple of visualizations of the extracted results on video after the break. [Thanks, Tom]The original text of this article was updated to reflect that this was already a known issue, albeit in limited circles. The ability to easily visualize the data is new.

Facebook's slick new camera app goes on strike if you don't give it access to your location. Here's why.Since Facebook released its new "Camera" mobile app yesterday, there's been speculation as to why the social network would buy Instagram and then release its own very similar app. There's been even more curiosity about why the new app has such an interest in where you are while using it.As users have noticed, the Camera app requires iOS' Location Services to be turned on so it can access your locally stored photos, and the app won't let you upload a shot if you simply deny it location access from the get-go.According to software developerJoshua Debner, who pinged BuzzFeed, about the behavior, the location services requirement is "an iOS limitation in order to be able to multiselect. Otherwise you would have had to pick one photo at a time..."That feature is what currently separates the Facebook Camera app from the photo uploading feature in Facebook's usual iPhone and iPad app. There you can only upload one shot at a time.iOS and Android app Gifboom uses the same API, and has its own explainer on the matter:In Facebook's case, the standalone Camera app can use that location information to let other users know where you were when you took the photo, but it isn't on by default.CNET's Bridget Carey received confirmation that you can use the app even if you're concerned by giving it access to your location. The work around: Just make sure that when you take photos with the iPhone camera, you've turned off location permissions. No GPS data is then attached to your photos. Then you can go into Facebook Camera and upload them location-free.iOS Location Services is turned on by default, but it can be disabled in the device settings, and users can choose which apps are allowed to access Location Settings. Also, while it will be little comfort to those truly paranoid about location privacy, users of the app can choose whether to share a photo's location data when posting it to Facebook.Updated at 5:24 p.m. PT to clarify how iOS handles location with additional background.

The iPhone continues to store location data even when location services are disabled, contrary to Apple’s previous claims.The Wall Street Journal did independent testing on an iPhone and found that even after turning off location services, the device was still collecting information on nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points.This discovery challenges some of Apple’s claims. As Wired.com reported last week, the company explained in a detailed letter last year that it deliberately collects geodata to store in a comprehensive location database to improve location services. In the letter, Apple noted that customers can disable location-data collection by turning off Location Services in the settings menu.“If customers toggle the switch to ‘Off,’ they may not use location-based services, and no location-based information will be collected,” Apple said in the letter (.pdf).That doesn’t appear to be the case from WSJ‘s testing, as well as multiple independent reports from customers who had the same results.The controversy surrounding Apple’s location-tracking stems from a discovery by two data scientists, who found that a file stored on iPhones and iPads (“consolidated.db”) contains a detailed history of geodata accompanied with time stamps.Apple claimed in its letter last year that the geodata is stored on the device, then anonymized and transmitted back to Apple every 12 hours, using a secure Wi-Fi connection (if one is available).Although it’s thorough, Apple’s explanation does not address why the stored geodata continues to live on the device permanently after it’s transmitted to Apple, nor does it address why geodata collection appears to persist even when Location Services is turned off.Google does similar geodata collection for its own location-services database. However, it notifies Android users clearly in a prompt when geodata collection will occur, and it also gives users a way to opt out. Also, Android devices do not permanently store geodata after transmitting it to Google.Meanwhile, a MacRumors.com reader claims he sent an e-mail to CEO Steve Jobs asking him to explain why Apple tracks geodata, threatening to switch to an Android device.“Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a Droid,” the reader wrote. “They don’t track me.”The CEO shot back a terse reply, defending his company and attacking his competitor Google, according to the reader: “Oh yes they do. We don’t track anyone. The info circulating around is false.”Apple has not commented on the authenticity of the e-mail.The purported e-mail is similar in nature to many e-mails that Jobs has sent to customers in the past: It’s concise and still manages to pull off some word play. Jobs would be accurate to claim that Apple is not tracking customers directly — but instead it is using iPhones to gather information about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi stations, occasionally combined with GPS data. In other words, Apple is tracking geodata from mobile devices, as Google is also doing.Apple has not commented on the location-tracking issue since the story broke last week.While the collected geodata doesn’t reveal specific addresses for locations you’ve visited, it can still leave a pretty rich trail of a user’s movements. Combine this data with other pieces of information on the iPhone, like your messages and photos, and you’ve got a device that knows more about you than you do yourself, says The Atlantic‘s Alexis Madrigal.Madrigal tested an iPhone forensics program called Lantern, which stitches together contacts, text messages and geodata into a neat interface that reconstructed a timeline of his life.“Immediately after trying out Lantern, I enabled the iPhone’s passcode and set it to erase all data on the phone,” Madrigal said. “This thing remembers more about where I’ve been and what I’ve said than I do, and I’m damn sure I don’t want it falling into anyone’s hands.”

As more and more businesses are switching to Apple products, Jobs is trying to make the move on two of the biggest U.S banks to become iPhone supporters. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are considering whether to let employees use the Apple iPhone as an alternative to RIM’s Blackberry for corporate e-mail. The banks are currently testing software for the iPhone that is designed to make it secure enough for company messages. The tests are the latest sign that RIM may be losing its tight grip on the corporate smartphone market. Companies are experimenting with alternatives such as Apple’s iPhone or devices that use Google’s Android software. “People are delighted with their iPhones and Android phones and they want to use them for work,” said Roger Entner, head of telecom research at Nielsen Co. “The result is RIM now has real competition for corporate customers.”RIM is already losing out on the battle, losing 15 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading this year before today, while Apple had climbed 51 percent. Apple led by Jobs, reported last month that 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone, including Procter & Gamble Co., General Electric Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. is exploring whether to let works use Androids or iPhones for corporate e-mail.Currently Bank of America, which has about 284,000 employees and Citigroup, which has about 258,000 employees are deploying or testing the new smartphones out. The efforts are intended to widen the choice of devices employees can use, rather than replace the Blackberry. The trials at the two companies involve more than 1,000 employees, which typically takes four to six weeks, and will be followed by a pilot project before potentially wider implementation. Laura Hunter, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina- based Bank of America, declined to comment on any specific trials, adding that “we continuously evaluate new and innovative technologies.”Apple is taking steps to make its products more appealing to businesses and challenge the Blackberry, which won over Wall Street banks and corporations with is security and reliability. Apple is working to improve the iPhone’s security by strengthening encryption tools and adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with server computers that can wipeout or lock an iPhone if it’s lost. The company even enlisted computer-services provide Unisys Corp. to help it sell more devices to corporate customers. While both RIM and Apple’s share of the global mobile-phone market rose last quarter from a year earlier as more consumers upgraded to smartphones, Apple moved into fourth position, knocking RIM into fifth, according to research firm IDC. The popularity of Apple’s latest model, the iPhone 4, helped the company sell more handsets than its Canadian rival.What do you think of the iPhone moving to Corporate America?

AT&T is raising the fees it charges buyers of the iPhone and other smartphones if they break their two-year contracts, while lowering them for "dumb" phones to better align the fees with their real costs.Starting June 1, smartphone buyers will have to pay $325 for breaking their contract, up from $175 currently. For buyers of regular phones, the fee is being decreased by $25 to $150.The early termination fee goes down for every month customers stay in their contract — by $10 for smart phones and $4 for regular phones. So if a smart phone contract is broken after two months, the termination fee is reduced by $20 to $305.The changes only apply to new contracts and renewals.AT&T charges customers $199 for the latest model of the iPhone, but pays Apple far more than that. AT&T makes the subsidy back through the customer's service fees over the two-year contract period. AT&T likely loses money for every customer that breaks a contract and pays a $175 termination fee, but may break even with the new, higher fee. A new iPhone model is expected to be announced next month.Meanwhile, simpler phones may cost AT&T only $125 to buy, meaning that a $175 termination fee is excessive.Following the same logic, Verizon Wireless doubled its smartphone termination fees in November, from $175 to $350. Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile still charge the same termination fees for all types of phones: $200. All three also pro-rate the fees for customers who leave later in their contracts.The Federal Communications Commission has questioned Verizon Wireless about the higher termination fees for smartphone users, but hasn't taken any action.The pro-rating of the fees came about after the carriers settled several class-action lawsuits by customers who found it unfair that they paid the full termination fee when breaking a contract after nearly two years.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple's new iPhone doesn't seem to like being touched much, and the beautiful (if easily discoloured) screen scratches too. Dear dear.To be fair, the scratching issue only affects the more-clumsy user, and there are only a couple of reports about discolouration in the corner of the screen, but it seems that the majority of iPhone 4s do have an aversion to being touched as sticky fingers are causing huge drops in signal strength.The problem was first noted by a reader on the MacRumors forum who provided a demonstration video:Since then tech blog Gizmodo has been canvassing early-adopters and accumulated a bundle of examples showing, in almost every case, that touching the bottom of the phone leads to around three bars being dropped off the indicated signal strength (which runs up to five).Even worse, a speed test performed by one reader demonstrated the download connection dropped to less than a third (from 840Kb/sec to 263Kb/sec) when they picked up the phone, a drop which could be slightly mitigated through the use of a leather case.Which brings us to the conspiracy part of the story – unlike previous iPhones, the latest model was launched along with accessories including the "bump case", which (it appears) would provide enough separation to improve the signal significantly. A deliberate plan by Apple seems a stretch to us, but it's hard to see how such a widespread problem got missed during development.Radio modelling can get very complicated, and the plethora of radios and frequencies used by a modern mobile phone adds to that complexity. In the past companies such as Nokia were able to leverage their vast experience with radio to create phones that just worked better than the competition. More recently the commoditisation of the radio component has enabled lots more players to create acceptable kit, though it seems in this case Apple may have tripped up.A few users may be seeing discolouration in the corners of their iPhone 4 screens (as reported by CNet), and some will manage to scratch them too (also reported by CNet), but the killer application for a mobile phone remains the ability to make phone calls, and it seems possible that in all the excitement Apple has forgotten that. ®

How Exactly Do People Use Siri?... If there’s one thing about Apple that I commend highly, it’s their power to buy new technology and make it more accessible. Second to that is their great advertising power. It’s like they are never content guzzling all the fame and power they can get. One proof to their tech buying savvy is Siri… Yup, your personal digital assistant with a spunky personality. Actually, Siri was no more than an iPhone app in the App...

"While he agreed that the app doesn't technically break the rules, he said that it does encroach upon the boundaries of what they can and cannot allow on their store. He also cited security concerns."Can't say we're surprised to hear that Apple rejected Greg Hughes' Wi-Fi Sync app . You know, the app that allows you to wirelessly sync your iPhone / iPod touch with iTunes without having to USB tether to your computer. Messing with Apple's synchronization technology is a pretty big no-no as demonstrated by Palm's webOS bluff . Here's the rejection as explained by Greg from an unnamed Apple rep over the phone: So while you won't find it in Apple's App Store, it's available now on Cydia for a cool $9.99. You have jailbroken your device haven't you? Don't make us get all MuscleNerd up in here.: An Apple spokeswoman contacted us to clarify that the rejection was the result of security issues and "technical issues including reading and writing outside of the app's container."

Thomas Suarez is in the 6th grade at a middle school in the South Bay. And while most of his peers are probably fussing over new soccer kleets or watching the Disney channel, he’s creating iOS apps and giving TED Talks.Suarez, who’s not even old enough to have a Facebook account, has been fascinated by computers and technology since before kindergarten. He’s established his own company, CarrotCorp and has made two iOS apps that are currently in the App Store: Earth Fortune, which displays different colors of Earth depending on what your fortune is and his most successful- Bustin Jieber, a Whac-a-Mole for Justin Bieber.“A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them,” he says. “And it’s difficult because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program…And not many parents have written apps.” Suarez, inspired by Steve Jobs, started an App Club at school where any student can come to learn to design an app. In the future, Suarez wants to create more apps, more games and get into Android programming and development. He plans on continuing his app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.Knowing that human beings such as Suarez exist makes me really hopeful and excited for the future. Watch his TED Talk from the recent TEDx conference in Manhattan Beach below. There are more great finds from around the Internet every day at TNW Shareables.

In light of the recent update in the developer's agreement for the iPhone, countless discussions have appeared on the internet which follow the same beaten path of such conversations.Namely, they boil down to somebody saying someting along these lines:"It's Steve Job's company, and he has every right to do whatever he wants with it. He sets up the rules. If you don't like the rules, don't buy his products, don't bitch about it on the forums".This point is incorrect for many reasons, one of them being that if you don't like people bitching about anything, you are just as free to not read it. However, that's not the reason I am going to talk about. The reason I will talk about is this:*Doing so does not make sense from an economic point of view. *All these assumptions are false. First of all, it is rarely the case that there exists a product on the market that has all the feature any particular customer wants. For that matter, one can desire a product that, in fact, is an iPhone with feature X on it.Secondly, the argument assumes that one can just go and buy a new piece of technology at any time, even if there is a product that satisfies the requirements. Not all people have the budget to switch. Some are tied by other factors (e.g. people who actually want an iPhone might be deterred by AT&T). Some people purhcased a product before a better one appeared on the market.Thirdly, simply buying a competitor's product doesn't work if only a minority of its users are not satisfied. As long as the decrease in the influx of customers is a smaller loss than the cost of adding a feature (think Fight Club!).More importantly, a person who bought an iPhone, didn't like it and switched is not a loss for Apple if the said person is silent about it. This brings us to the fourth point: that's exactly what Apple would want you to do: they would rather lose customers than have complaining customers. This is why the phones are locked and the App store is insanely restrictive, in spite of potential loss of customers that it brings.So, as a consumer who is unhappy about X on the iPhone, what are you to do?You are to bitch about it, loudly and publicly. You are to scream in all forums about how X makes your life miserable, and how iPhone is not good without X. You are to say that you are going to switch to an Android phone next month because X on the iPhone makes it unusable for everybody. Make a "Top 5 reasons why you shouldn't own an iPhone" on your blog ("Top 10" if you own one), with X being the No. 1 reason.In short, you are to make a person about to buy an iPhone reconsider doing it because of X.So, you are to make some bad publicity for Apple. Bad publicity is always a loss for a company, and it's a loss that is noticeable to shareholders. In this day and age, even a blog post can go far. And if you scare the shareholders, even Steve Jobs will have to abide. And if Apple still keeps its course in spite of your efforts, you still win by strengthening the competition, who (if smart) might even make a product for you that is good and has X.tl;dr: if you want a feature X on a platform, bitching about X en masse is an effective way to hurt the company just enough for it to provide X for you. So, Bitching is a good negative reinforcement.

The Zoomback team has come out with a small gps gadget that you can place on anything and track it through your iPhone.  All you have to do is to get hold of the Zoomback device as you can see in the picture below and keep it in the backpack of your children or attach to your suitcase and download and install the iPhone app on your iPhone. Start the iPhone app and use your online username and password to log in and click on “Find Now” to track your items.If you want to keep a continuous track of your items, switch to continuous mode and you will be able to track the movement of anything that you want to track at an interval of five minutes.While Zoombak modules retail for $99 to $149 (USD) each, but I managed to find many modules for as little as $38 over at Amazon, which is a steal. You can grab the iPhone app here.

The Michigan man behind a massive iPod repair and return scam will soon be thinking about his actions in a jail cell. Twenty-three-year-old Nicholas Woodhams, also known as the "iPod Mechanic," was sentenced to 13 months in prison this week after pleading guilty to mail fraud and money laundering charges earlier this year. In addition to jail time, Woodhams was ordered to pay $648,568 in restitution to Apple as well as $8,066.85 to the US Postal Service, according to the US Attorney General's Office.Apple filed a lawsuit against Woodhams in July of 2008 for defrauding the company out of numerous iPod shuffles and other iPod repairs. The company accused Woodhams of exploiting Apple's advance replacement system for the iPod shuffle, reselling the new devices through his own website. Additionally, Woodhams exploited Apple's iPod Warranty Service Program to get repairs on iPods that were out of warranty. Less than a year later, prosecutors in Michigan filed criminal charges against Woodhams, alleging that he committed fraud and laundered money as a part of his scam.In April of this year, Woodhams must have been scared enough to try and come up with a plea bargain, admitting that he was guilty for the criminal charges. That brings us to where we are today: Woodhams was sentenced by US District Judge Robert Holmes Bell to prison time plus restitution on Tuesday of this week. In addition to all of the above, Woodhams was also forced to forfeit about $750,000 worth of ill-gotten gains, including a house in Michigan, an Audi S4, an Ariel Atom 2, a Honda motorcycle, and more than half a million dollars in cold, hard cash.For those keeping track, that's a grand total of about $1,406,634.85 (or so) that Woodhams will be forking over to everyone involved. For someone who is only 23, that's a hefty price to pay for what originated as an easy way to make a buck on the Internet.

Motorola and Verizon invited comparisons, and that's what they gotThe Droid lands in stores Friday, and on Thursday the heavyweight reviewers -- which is to say the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg and the New York Times' David Pogue -- weighed in.Given that Motorola (MOT) and Verizon (VZ) pitched the Droid in its first TV ad as everything Apple's (AAPL) and AT&T's (T) iPhone was not, it was perhaps inevitable that every reviewer so far, including these two, treated its arrival as a grudge match.Mossberg's review is positive but tepid -- especially the video version. He plods through the comparisons item by item like a slightly boring homework assignment. His top-line summary:"While it has some significant drawbacks, I regard it as a success overall. It's the best super-smart phone Verizon offers, the best Motorola phone I've tested and the best hardware so far to run [Google's (GOOG)] Android. I can recommend the Droid to Verizon loyalists who have lusted for a better smart phone, but don't want to switch networks." (link)Pogue being Pogue has more fun with the assignment, even running a Twitter contest to come up with a new term for these newfangled gizmos. (He's going with "app phones"; Mossberg calls them "super-smart phones.") Pogue's bottom line:Since Verizon seems to want a Droid-iPhone faceoff, here it is: the Droid wins on phone network, customizability, GPS navigation, speaker, physical keyboard, removable battery and openness (free operating system, mostly uncensored app store). The iPhone wins on simplicity, refinement, thinness, design, Web browsing, music/video synching with your computer, accessory ecosystem and quality/quantity of the app store." (link)For a more thorough comparison, written by someone who actually seems to care, check out developer Greg Kumparak's 2,500 word review in TechCrunch. His conclusion: "At this point, I honestly feel that either choice would make any sane person incredibly happy."

The Samsung Galaxy S3 is outselling the iPhone 5 despite Apple's hugely hyped launch, according to new figures.Comparison site uSwitch says the S3 outsold the iPhone on deals from British phone networks in September, but the figures don't include any phones sold SIM-free. Despite the huge hype around its launch, the iPhone 5 arrives at -- appropriately enough -- number five with a bullet on the uSwitch hotlist.Although the iPhone went on sale in shops on 21 September, it was available to order online from the 14th. While that means it was on sale for less time than other phones, the first few days often see the fastest sales, like the opening weekend of a movie. As queues formed outside Apple Stores days in advance, the iPhone 5 ended up shifting 5 million phones globally in the first three days -- beating the previous model's first month of sales. So we'd expect the iPhone to have a stellar fortnight.By contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S3 has been on sale since May, so you'd expect sales to have slowed, but with five months at the top is clearly still selling like heated comestibles. The iPhone was also outsold by the Samsung Galaxy Ace and the older Galaxy S2, and the iPhone 4S, showing that many phone fans would rather bag a bargain on an older phone than splash out on the latest iPhone.The Mobile Tracker report is based on figures derived from uSwitch and its network of mobile phone comparison partners, so doesn't include those buying unlocked iPhones direct from Apple -- or indeed any other SIM-free phone.If you're considering buying a new iPhone, check out our iPhone comparison guide to save oodles of boodle.Have you bought a new phone in the last month? Did you opt for a new phone or bag a bargain? Tell me your thoughts in the comments or on our Facebook page.

In late March, four US Senators banded together and wrote a letter to Apple asking that they remove apps that alert users as to the whereabouts of DUI checkpoints.“With more than 10,000 Americans dying in drunk-driving crashes every year,” the letter stated, “providing access to iPhone and iPad applications that alert users to DUI checkpoints is harmful to public safety. We know that your company shares our desire to end the scourge of drunk driving and we therefore would ask you to remove these applications from your store.”While some of these apps make use of information housed in publicly accessible databases, many of them rely on crowdsourcing. Indeed, one app singled out by the letter is alleged to have had approximately 10 million users actively alerting “each other to DUI checkpoints in real time.”In a separate letter sent concurrently by US Sentator Charles Schumer, Schumer also called out apps like Trapster and PhantomAlert which work to alert users as to the whereabouts of police speed traps and red light cameras.Well, Apple took those letters to heart, partially.In revised app store guidelines discovered by Mac Rumors, Apple has updated Section 22.8 to now read:So one out of two ain’t bad, and in all honesty, Apple made the right decision here.DUI checkpoint apps do nothing more than tell potentially intoxicated drivers where not to go. They’re still driving drunk, just on the down low. Apps like Trapster, however, might effectively work to cut down on speeding when a police speed trap is noted. Though to be fair, it might encourage speeders to pick their spots more strategically.Either way, drunk driving is a lot more serious and contentious than speeders which is probably why Apple chose to only address DUI checkpoint apps.We should note, however, that DUI checkpoint apps already on the iTunes App Store haven’t been kicked out and we’ll have to wait and see if they’re grandfathered in or if they’ll eventually be removed. Take DUI Dodger, for example, which enables users to view and submit checkpoints in their area.

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

Developing applications for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is big business, and it's one that Novell (NASDAQ: NOVL) wants a piece of. Novell today released new software called MonoTouch that aims to bring .NET applications to the iPhone.MonoTouch is based on Novell's Mono project, which is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET framework. Unlike Mono, MonoTouch is neither free nor open source and is being sold as a commercial product by Novell. With MonoTouch, Novell is expanding the developer base for iPhone applications beyond just C to include .NET and its millions of global developers.Miguel de Icaza, vice president for developer platforms at Novell, explained that MonoTouch is built from the same source code base as Mono, but there are some differences."Mono is a traditional .NET implementation with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler," De Icaza told InternetNews.com. "The iPhone has both a legal and technical limitation for interpreters in general, so we had to modify it."He added that MonoTouch includes a static compiler, which means that there are some dynamic things that developers are used to doing with .NET that they won't be able to do with MonoTouch. In particular, he noted that the add-on IronPython and IronRuby languages do not currently work with MonoTouch.De Icaza added that there is no magic porting tool for traditional .NET applications to run on MonoTouch for the iPhone. The reason is due to the dynamic compiler issues, which can affect software libraries.The 1.0 launch of MonoTouch follows a relatively rapid development cycle from De Icaza and his team. He said the first MonoTouch prototype was completed in early May, and the limited beta program opened up in August. According to De Icaza, there were 600 people in the beta program.With 1.0 now available, the plan is to continue to evolve MonoTouch and add new features over time. Among the features for the MonoTouch 2.0 roadmap is support for Microsoft's Silverlight media framework. Novell has an effort known as Moonlight that provides an open source implementation."MonoTouch is not an open source effort, although the foundation with Mono is," De Icaza said.He added that many of the pieces that are necessary for MonoTouch are not open source. Among those pieces are all the API bindings to the Apple platform. Novell has been working on Mono since 2004 as an open source implementation of the .NET framework. The most recent release is Mono 2.4, which provides performance improvements."MonoTouch is proprietary and I don't feel guilty about that," De Icaza said. "Mono is open source, but on the iPhone we felt that it's a proprietary platform, a very locked down platform and we felt if you're targeting that platform, we might as well make it proprietary as well."

Apple rushed to file a last minute request with the court to stop Samsung from making public a series of sensitive sales data documents related to the iPhone and iPad when it cross examines Philip Schiller, Apple?s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, later today.The judge presiding over the patent case between Apple and Samsung has worked to keep the closely watched trial, and all related evidence, as transparently open as possible, but has allowed both parties to argue in support of sealing specific, confidential evidence on a case-by-case basis. In addition to sales and marketing data, Apple's various motions to keep evidence private and confidential have also included iOS source code, which the company holds to be particularly sensitive. Apple has most recently filed two motions related to eight confidential trial exhibits of sales data, which the company's attorneys described as "a particularized, document-by-document showing of good cause and compelling reasons for sealing of Apple?s most competitively sensitive information." The motions included "declarations from several of its executives attesting to the value of this information, the efforts Apple has undertaken to maintain its secrecy, and the harm that Apple would suffer if it were publicly disclosed." Apple stated that it had originally filed a motion last week to seal four documents Samsung had said it would use during Schiller's cross examination scheduled for today, but added four more after being notified last night after 9 PM by Samsung that it planned to use another four. The documents in question include iPhone, iPad and iPod touch sales summaries, an iPad tracking study, and a series of quarterly iPhone buyer surveys conducted over the past two years. Apple also objected to Samsung's last minute surprise notification of the additional documents it planned to present today, but asked the court that "only excerpted portions of those documents be entered into evidence" if it decided to allow the late filings. The iPhone maker has proposed using excerpted versions of various sales report and other documents it holds to be confidential, putting only a few specific, relevant pages of the hundreds of pages of the documents in question into evidence in a manner than would become part of the public record. Apple argued that this "would lessen the burdens on the jury and the Court and would balance the public interest in access to court records and Apple?s interest in maintaining secrecy of its valuable trade secrets," but noted that it was "unable to reach agreement" with Samsung on the matter. In response to Apple's motion, US District Court Judge Lucy Koh ordered that two exhibits on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch sales summaries would be sealed in part with the redactions Apple requested earlier in the week, and that only the relevant pages of two studies Samsung plans to question Schiller about will be entered into evidence. The additional four documents Samsung announced it would use today "shall not be used in the examination of Mr. Schiller as they were not timely disclosed," the judge wrote in her response to the motion.

This one’s nuts. Remember how there were no police reports about the missing iPhone 5 prototype, even though CNet reported that police offices had actually searched a man’s house looking for it? The guy whose home was searched in search of that lost iPhone 5 prototype says the officials weren’t actually police officers… they were Apple employees impersonating them.The implication is that the officials, who appear to be members of Apple’s security team, were impersonating police, a crime punishable by up to a year in jail in California.In July, an iPhone 5 prototype was purportedly lost in Cava 22, a San Francisco bar. Shortly after, the home of Sergio Calderón, 22, of Bernal Heights in San Francisco, was searched by six officials claiming to be police. They had traced the missing iPhone 5 prototype to his home using GPS.But now it appears that the six officials — four men and two women, all wearing badges of some kind — weren’t SFPD, but part of Apple’s security team. A phone number given to Calderón by one of the men who identified himself as “Tony,” belongs to Anthony Colon, a former San Jose Police sergeant who is employed as a “senior investigator” at Apple (LinkedIn profile).“This is something that’s going to need to be investigated now,” SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfield said, when informed about the Bernal Heights man’s statements to SF Weekly. “If this guy is saying that the people said they were SFPD, that’s a big deal.”The story of the lost prototype was reported by CNet earlier this week, citing an unnamed source. However, SFPD has no record of the case and when we visited the bar where the phone was supposedly lost, the manager knew nothing about it.Here’s a picture of Anthony Colon and a screenshot of his LinkedIn profile, which has now been removed:

One of our very close AT&T sources just sent us in these images. Yes, it’s a fried iPhone 4. Apparently a customer brought the phone into the store to try and get help with it, although it’s pretty evident that the phone is unrepairable. It’s the first time our guy has seen this happen (us too), but the brand new iPhone 4 caught on fire while being hooked up to a computer using the Apple USB cable that accompanied the device. The customer wanted to exchange the iPhone — obviously — for a new, non-charred unit however the AT&T store in question was out of stock. An Apple Store did confirm to our AT&T connection that this did appear to be a defective USB port and not some sort of user error. Our source went onto say that the phone bezel was extremely hot (obviously), and it slightly burned the customers hand. The USB port in the phone was slightly melted and the cord was badly melted (as is apparent in the pictures). Hopefully this is the only time we see our beloved iPhones meet a fiery death. We’ve got one more picture for you after the break.

The target release date for the unlock is New Year’s Eve 2008. This unlock method is available to iPhone 3Gs that have 2.11.07 baseband or earlier, we did warn you. You can tell what version baseband you have by going to Settings->General->About->Modem Firmware. The unlock requires a jailbroken 3G iPhone.  It’ll be installable via Cydia, and so it doesn’t matter if you have a Mac or PC. Please refrain from updating your baseband, regardless of what version you’re at.  We’ll have complete directions on New Year’s Eve. We’ll stream a live demo of the unlock before Christmas (see the update at the end of this post).Softpedia doesn't condone jailbreaking / unlocking your iPhone / iPod touch or any other device. Using hacks may render your device unusable, or may considerably reduce the quality of your experience using the respective device. If you choose to download and install the PwnageTool, you do it at your own risk.The iPhone Dev Team, best known for its PwnageTool and QuickPwn hack software, has confirmed the completion of the iPhone 3G unlock. Those interested in jailbreaking their devices are advised not to upgrade to OS 2.2 using iTunes alone.“Over the Christmas break some of our members will be talking at the Chaos Computer Club’s 25C3 Congress,” a Dev-Team Blog post reads. “This talk will be a juicy technical talk relating to iPhone platform and our previous exploits.[...] We have been working hard on a few other things. The main one being the 3G unlock codenamed 'yellowsn0w.' This is now completed and is currently being packaged into a user-friendly application with the simplicity that you see in QuickPwn or BootNeuter.” Some facts for visitors of the blog are also listed. Readers are assumed to be OK with jailbreaks, hence the team's advice of refraining from updating the iPhone 3G's baseband. Read on for the details: It has been recently revealed that the newly-released Mac OS X 10.5.6 update keeps Macs from recognizing the iPhone in DFU mode , making it impossible to jailbreak / unlock it using PwnageTool or QuickPwn. Taking on the DFU Issues in OS X 10.5.6, the Dev Team explains that “Lots of users have been experiencing problems with the use of DFU mode after applying yesterday’s 10.5.6 system update. We believe this behavior is due to a kernel bug not a specific countermeasure by Apple.” The team offers some workarounds, but asks not to be held responsible should anything bad happen. It's probably best if you wait until New Year's Eve to jailbreak your device. Of course, it's probably even better to read the text in red and act accordingly.

The employer of the spouse of my enemy's lawyerApple's billion dollar patent court victory should be dismissed, Samsung say, because the jury foreman in the case was biased. Samsung's call for a retrial in the fight between the two tech giants will be heard on 6th December by judge Lucy Koh in the same San Jose court where the original verdict was handed down.New information about the Jury Foreman Velvin Hogan taints the jury verdict, Samsung says. Hogan did not reveal to the court that he was bankrupted following a lawsuit against a company in which Samsung is now a shareholder. Hogan was sued by his former employer Seagate Technologies in 1993 and filed for bankruptcy. As of 2011 Samsung have owned a chunk of Seagate shares, in exchange for selling the storage company their HDD business.Sammie have asked Apple to disclose when these two facts became known to Apple.Apple has rejected all the charges in a counter-motion, describing Samsung's argument as a "convoluted theory", and throwing scorn on the idea that Hogan would try to "exact revenge" on a Seagate shareholder and the spouse of a lawyer who had acted against him 19 years ago.Samsung’s theory fails on the merits because the decades-old Seagate dispute has nothing to do with this case and would not have supported challenge for cause, and Samsung has not shown that Mr. Hogan’s responses were “dishonest” and “material,” as Supreme Court precedent requires.Apple have added that it was up to Samsung's lawyers to quiz and approve jury members before the trial.Koh said yesterday that she would hear the arguments on the 6th December. ®APPLE, INC. v.

Apple says terrorists could use iPhones to attack cell phone towersApple has tried everything to stop iPhone unlockers.  Bricking iPhones didn't work -- it just generated more headaches and bad PR.  Apple's internal protection technology turned out to be just as weak and poorly implemented as its consumer security on the iPhone -- the hackers quickly overcame the latest protections Apple threw at them.  Now with its shiny new iPhone 3G S becoming yet the latest handset to be freed, Apple has turned to none other than the U.S. government for help. The company has submit a report to the U.S. Copyright Office suggesting that iPhone unlocking be outlawed (and jailbreaking from the AT&T network, essentially as well as it would be impossible without unlocking) as Apple claims it threatens cell phone towers across America.  Apple claims that unlocking the iPhone provides easy access to the iPhone’s BBP — the “baseband processor” software, which enables a connection to cell phone towers. According to Apple, the BBP could then be exploited by "a local or international hacker could potentially initiate commands (such as a denial of service attack) that could crash the tower software, rendering the tower entirely inoperable to process calls or transmit data." States Apple, "Taking control of the BBP software would be much the equivalent of getting inside the firewall of a corporate computer — to potentially catastrophic result.  The technological protection measures were designed into the iPhone precisely to prevent these kinds of pernicious activities, and if granted, the jailbreaking exemption would open the door to them." Currently, iPhone unlocking falls under a legal gray zone.  The comments by Apple come in response to an ongoing request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to legalize the widespread practice of unlocking.  Apple wants to push it in the other direction make unlocking and jailbreaking the phone illegal. Fred von Lohmann, the EFF attorney in charge of the EFF request mocked Apple's filing openly, calling its claims "preposterous".  He says that there's an estimated 1 million unlocked iPhones operating in the U.S. and that they have posed no threat thus far.  He states, "As far as I know, nothing like that has ever happened.  This kind of theoretical threat is more FUD than truth." Apple also claims that unlocking and jailbreaking also could be used to enable the alteration of the Exclusive Chip Identification number, allowing for anonymous phone calls.  States Apple, "This would be desirable to drug dealers." Unlocking the iPhone may currently be banned under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which states that "no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title." However, citizen requests, such as the EFF filing, must be considered for exemption every three years.  The Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office is tasked with that responsibility.

Apple has found a new way to get people to agree to online tracking: withhold applications from them if they don't. This week Apple is launching a new iPhone. And with that comes a new operating system and the company's new advertising platform.According to Apple's new privacy policy, users can opt out if they don't want to be served targeted ads. But if they don't want to share their location information with the company, they also won't have access to new apps from the iTunes store.The launch of Apple's iAd advertising system this week comes with some new terms and conditions. Apple will be serving targeted advertising. Users can opt out of receiving such ads, but it won't be particularly easy. And the company thinks it would be cooler if people didn't opt out. According to the new T&Cs:"Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests."Apple customers who want to opt out of tracking have to use the above URL from an Apple device running iOS 4 to do so. And each of their devices using that operating system must be logged out individually.In addition, Apple is collecting "precise," "real-time geographic location" of its customers who use its new iOS software that runs on the new iPhone.Apple's wording assures customers that location data is “collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you.” But it also doesn't give people a choice to opt out of location tracking. Users have to agree to the new terms and conditions before downloading new apps or any other data from the iTunes store.Meanwhile, the new T&Cs are light on details regarding what will happen with this location information. The company's privacy policy states:"To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the MobileMe “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work."Obviously, applications that rely on location will be among the “partners and licensees” who will access location data. But it would be nice to have details on what location-based services other than Find My iPhonewill utilize the data. Apple also insists that the data will be anonymous, but they are not divulging how long the data will be kept, which could irk privacy advocates.

Motorola targets young men with its most testosterone-heavy TV commercial yetSomeone had fun writing this ad copy:Droid. Should a phone be pretty? Should it be a tiara-wearing digitally clueless beauty pageant queen? Or should it be fast? Racehorse duct-taped to a Scud missile fast. We say the latter. So we built the phone that does. Does rip through the Web like a circular saw through a ripe banana. Is it a precious porcelain figurine of a phone? In truth? No. It's not a princess. It's a robot. A phone that trades hair-do for can-do.The new Droid commercial that debuted in prime-time Thursday night (and is pasted below the fold) opened a new front in Motorola (MOT) and Verizon's (VZ) $100 million ad campaign to take market share from Apple's (AAPL) iPhoneEarlier commercials had appealed to the fragile male ego with icons of masculinity: stealth bombers, heavyweight fighters, rock-crushing machinery.This one goes after the competition by painting it -- and its users -- as effeminate.It's a strategy as old as the schoolyard, and it seems to be working -- at least on one side of the yard. A new YouGov BrandIndex survey taken Thursday shows Motorola's buzz rising relative to Apple's and Research in Motion's (RIMM) among men 18 and older. And the company seems to be on track in its stated goal of selling 1 million Droids by New Years.It remains to be seen whether it has burned its bridges to the other half of the market in the process.

Steve Jobs has responded to the mounting questions about iPhones collecting location data for up to a year - a revelation that could lead to privacy investigations by some European governments.In a characteristically terse email, apparently sent directly from his iPhone, the Apple chief executive - who is officially on medical leave from his company, and has been seen only briefly in public since January - insisted that "we don't track anyone", and instead aimed his ire at Google, claiming that "they do" track users.The exchange, documented by a reader of the MacRumors website who emailed Jobs (whose address is well-known online), appears to be legitimate. Apple has not commented on its provenance.Could you please explain the necessity of the passive location-tracking tool embedded in my iPhone? It's kind of unnerving knowing that my exact location is being recorded at all times. Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a [Google Android] Droid. They don't track me.Oh yes they do. We don't track anyone. The info circulating around is false.While it is certainly true that Android phones do gather anonymised location information, Google has insisted that the collection is opt-in, with a clear dialogue which the user is presented with before proceeding. In addition, Google's system only retains the most recent 50 mobile cell masts and 200 Wi-Fi networks seen, and in a form that is hard to access. By contrast Apple's seems to collect an almost unlimited amount in a form which is easily accessible to anyone who gets their hands on the phone.Apple has also confirmed to the US Congress that iPhones and iPads collect location data when permitted by the user, and buried in the lengthy license document for the iTunes Store (used to synchronise data) is an 86-word paragraph which gives the company the right to access location data collected by the user.However the data is all anonymised, with no personal details of the user or physical addresses for the phone.Jobs's claim that "we don't track anyone" is arguably true, in that Apple could not target named individuals. However the benefits of the location-tracking services to targeted advertising based on whether a phone is being used are clear to both Apple and Google.Jobs's assertion that "The info circulating around is false" is hard to analyse, given that he does not say which information he is referring to. But hundreds of people have posted maps online showing how their iPhone or iPad has tracked their movements.

With Android getting all Flash-ey , Apple's "Goldilocks" position on Flash -- the full Flash player is too hefty, Flash Lite is too weak -- seemed pretty untenable. Now Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen has revealed that Apple and Adobe are "collaborating" on making Flash a reality on the iPhone, citing the technical challenge it presents. What's clear is that with all this work to do, it doesn't seem they're going the watered-down Flash Lite route, but we're trying not to hold our breath for a full-on, Hulu-friendly version that will finally help us get that Doogie Howser fix on the go. Naturally, there's no word on when this will hit.[Via AppleInsider

Police have located and spoken to the man who found an iPhone prototype left behind by an Apple engineer at a San Francisco-area bar last month, according to media reports.Stephen Wagstaffe, a San Mateo County District Attorney spokesman, said police in Redwood City have spoken to the man but declined to disclose his name, according to reports by both CNET News and KCBS.In a recorded message on his work phone Wednesday, Wagstaffe said there was nothing new to report on the iPhone case and there was "nothing further to discuss concerning what has gone on so far."Wagstaffe also declined to say if the man is suspected of selling the prototype phone to Gizmodo, an online gadget guide site, the reports said.Last week, the New York Times reported Gizmodo paid the man $5,000 US for the prototype dubbed iPhone 4, 4G or HD in blogs, and posted photos and video of it on April 19 showing its new features, including a camera flash and a second camera for video chatting.Gizmodo editor Jason Chen said the phone had been left at a bar in Redwood City by one of Apple Inc.'s engineers.Chen arranged to return the iPhone when the company posted a letter by its lawyer asking for its return last week.Last Friday, a special computer-crime task force made up of different law enforcement agencies searched Chen's house and car in Fremont, Calif., and took computers, servers and accessories.The search warrant said the computer and other devices may have been used to commit a felony. Investigators also seized Chen's credit card bills and copies of his cheques.Chen's lawyers argue that California's shield law, which protects journalists from having to turn over anonymous sources or unpublished material to law enforcement during a search, should apply to him.

It might be a cliche, but sometimes, a picture says more than a thousand words. Over the years, I've often talked about how the technology world is iterative, about how products are virtually always built upon that which came before, about how almost always, multiple people independently arrive at the same products since they work within the same constraints of the current state of technology. This elementary aspect of the technology world, which some would rather forget, has been illustrated very, very well in one of Samsung's legal filings against AppleThis is what Samsung was considering putting to market in the summer of 2006, six months before the unveiling of the iPhone.One of these phones (the bottom-right one) became the Samsung F700 - a product Apple once included as an infringing product, but later withdrew once it learned Samsung created it and brought it to market before the iPhoneIt extends to more than just the hardware - Samsung was also working on interfaces that looks remarkably like iOS (actually, that look remarkably like PalmOS) - in the summer and fall of 2006. Again, before the iPhone was released.The most damning and interesting graphic is one of those 'before-after-the-iPhone'-ones. In it, Samsung quite effectively demonstrates that its phones - like the Galaxy line - are clearly descendant from Samsung's pre-iPhone designs, and not from the iPhone.Seems like an open and shut case to me. Samsung didn't have to look very far for prior art - it created it itself. Doesn't that just boggle the mind? Samsung is being accused of stealing, even thought the company was clearly working on what it supposedly stole before the iPhone was even released. Samsung's phones bear more resemblance to its own pre-iPhone designs than to the iPhone, yet Apple and its supporters still insist Samsung is a thief.All this reminds me a lot of the early '80s and the development of the graphical user interface (a process I prefer to divide up into generations). The 'invention' of the GUI was a very long process, which, in my view, started with Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad (1st generation GUI), and ended with the work done at Xerox (3rd generation GUI). I say 'ended' because even though some people are easily fooled by fancier graphics and swapping a mouse for a finger, every device we own still employs what is essentially Xerox' interface.Xerox didn't realise they were sitting on a revolution, so other companies swooped in and created the 4th generation of GUIs; Apple, Amiga, and Digital Research (GEM) all developed a fourth generation GUI simultaneously in pretty much the same timespan. However, these days, many people just give all the credit to Apple and be done with it.Apple acts as if the iPhone was developed in a vacuum, and wants the world to believe that it, and only it, invented the concept of a touchscreen phone. With that nonsensical idea, the company not only ignores the long history of mobile computing (specifically PalmOS which is iOS' and Android's common ancestor), but also the fact that other companies were working on touchscreen phones at the same time (LG Prada, these Samsung images).Apple wants to rewrite history. As a geek, I find that incredibly offensive.

Electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn has denied earlier reports that thousands of workers went on strike on Friday at a plant that assembles Apple’s latest iPhone — reportedly causing production of the device to be “paralysed”. Today Foxconn said no such strike took place and claimed production of the iPhone 5 is on schedule, Reuters is reporting.Earlier reports had suggested 3,000 to 4,000 workers began striking at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou complex on Friday afternoon — with the disputes apparently triggered by “over-exacting quality controls” on iPhone 5 production, compounded by a lack of worker training to meet the new, higher standards. Demands that workers also work through a week-long national holiday also caused tensions to boil over into industrial action, according to reports.But Foxconn Technology Group sent Reuters a statement today denying there had been a strike. It said two brief and small disputes took place at the plant in question, several days earlier, but claimed these were “immediately addressed” and did not escalate into an “employee strike”. Additional staff were also provided for “the lines in question”, it added.“Any reports that there has been an employee strike are inaccurate,” Reuters quotes Foxconn in an emailed statement. Foxconn added that “there has been no workplace stoppage in that facility or any other Foxconn facility and production has continued on schedule”. Employees who worked over the national holiday did so voluntarily, it added.Also in the email, Foxconn said it received instructions from Apple to “strengthen quality inspections” for the iPhone 5 — “following multiple complaints from customers regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone”.We’ve asked Apple to confirm this claim and will update with any response.

When you see people flipping through e-books on iPads or iPhones, there is a good chance they bought the books through Amazon.com, not Apple.Now, Apple wants to change that.Apple confirmed Tuesday that it would require app developers that sell e-books outside of their iPad and iPhone apps — through a Web site, for example — to also sell the books inside those apps. And purchases that originate in the app must be made through Apple, which keeps a 30 percent cut.Apple said it was newly enforcing an existing rule, one that will force Amazon, Sony, Google and other e-book sellers to change the way their apps work.“We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app,” Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.Amazon makes Kindle reading apps for the iPad and iPhone, and those apps now send readers to a Web browser window to make book purchases from Amazon, dodging the Apple fee. Sony said on Monday that Apple had rejected its reading app, which worked the same way.The move is surprising because Apple has benefited from the wealth of content available for its devices, said Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a consultant to book publishers.“Most of the people reading on the iPad are buying their books from these other people, and that’s a great thing for Apple,” Mr. Shatzkin said. “It’s selling tons of devices for Apple and tons of content for everybody else.”It is highly unlikely that Amazon, Sony or others will be willing to share e-book revenue or customer information with its competitor, Apple, which sells its own e-books in its iBookstore.Steve Haber, president of Sony’s digital reading business, said that Sony was working on “different ways to bring content to Apple devices,” though he declined to elaborate on what those are.For now, Apple has said only that it is applying the rule to e-books. But other apps give customers the ability to make outside purchases, so it could potentially apply to apps that sell movies, magazines, music or virtual goods in games as well. Apple declined to comment on whether the rule applied to apps other than e-readers.

Apple is selling the iPhone 3G on its Apple Store Web site in Hong Kong, promising the phones "can be activated with any wireless carrier."The Apple Store in Hong Kong is selling the 8GB and 16GB iPhone 3G models for HK$5,400 (US$695) and HK$6,200, respectively, with free shipping. The store advertises the compatibility of the phones with any carrier, saying, "Simply insert the SIM [subscriber identity module] from your current phone into iPhone 3G and connect to iTunes 8 to complete activation."On the Apple Store's main page for Hong Kong, the site says, "Buy directly from Apple. And choose your carrier.""Customer response to the iPhone 3G has been off the charts, and we are thrilled to offer our customers in Hong Kong another way to get their hands on this revolutionary device," an Apple spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to questions.The company did not comment on whether online iPhone 3G sales and activation will be extended to other markets.The iPhone 3G has been available in Hong Kong since July 11 through Hutchison Telecommunications. The cheapest monthly plan offered by the operator charges HK$2,938 for the 8GB version and HK$3,738 for the 16GB one, along with a two-year contract that costs HK$188 per month.Checks of the Apple Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Singapore, show the iPhone 3G is not available for sale online. Instead, the sites offer a link to a list of stores where the phone is on sale.

AT&T’s Ralph de la Vega this morning said the carrier either has to “reduce or modify” the mobile data consumption of some of its high-end users. Which could mean the end of flat-rate pricing in favor of prices that vary based on network congestion.AT&T’s Ralph de la Vega used today’s UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York to deliver a message to the carrier’s data-hungry mobile users: We will have ways of modifying — or monetizing — your behavior.Noting that roughly 3 percent of AT&T users generate 40 percent of the traffic on the network, de la Vega spoke of offering “incentives” to get users to curb their data habits. Those “incentives,” though, may come in the form of stiffer fees or higher changes for downloading information during business hours — what’s known as congestion pricing for mobile broadband.“I’m not going to give you in detail what we’re going to do, but if three are causing 40 percent, then we’re going to try to focus on making sure we give incentives to those small percentages to either reduce or modify their usage so they don’t crowd out the other users in those same cell sites,” de la Vega said. “You’ll see us address that more in detail in the future…What’s driving usage on the network and driving these high-usage situations are things like video or audio that keeps playing around the clock. We’ve got to get to those customers and have them recognize and change their patterns.”As Stacey wrote a few months ago (GigaOM Pro, sub. required), a combination of attractive price plans, high-quality smartphones and the rise of mobile applications are already driving mobile broadband usage — in a big way. Much of the traffic is due to streaming content such as web-based video and on-the-go music services that require far more bandwidth than things like text messaging and mobile e-mail. And that consumption will surely continue to surge as netbooks and a flood of other connected devices come to market, and as the fatter pipes of LTE make accessing content even easier and faster.Indeed, de la Vega this morning said that simply boosting capacity on AT&T’s 850 Mhz network in New York resulted in an “overnight” traffic increase of 30 percent. AT&T’s woes are a prime example of network shortcomings, to be sure, and the carrier is scrambling to appease data-hungry users by upgrading its 3G network to HSPAen route to the 4G technology LTE. But other operators are certain to experience such growing pains as they grow their data businesses with iPhone-like handsets.Carriers are increasingly turning to technologies like Wi-Fi and femtocells to help offload the increasing traffic, but operators will likely also abandon their flat-rate pricing models in favor of congestion pricing. A consumer who uses mobile data primarily for email on the phone, for instance, could opt for 200kbps service while a netbook-toting road warrior could be asked to shell out for a 1.5Mbps connection. And connectivity could vary not just by user but also by use case, giving consumers the flexibility to pay more when they need a lot of data quickly or during peak hours. Cable operators and a handful of European ISPs are already toying with such models.Congestion pricing has some substantial drawbacks, of course. Charging consumers based on a host of variables is a marketing strategy destined to foster confusion in the minds of users, and it could force carriers to make upgrades to billing infrastructures to ensure users are billed accurately. But with mobile data already straining the capacity of some operators’ networks, it’s a model you may see sooner than you expect.

Apple's chief foe in the mobile sector and in the courtroom goes after the new iPhone, alleging that the device infringes on eight of its patents.Fresh off a courtroom victory against Apple today, Samsung filed another legal salvo against its chief foe.The Korean electronics giant submitted an amendment to a lawsuit originally filed in April against Apple, adding the iPhone 5 to a list of devices that includes the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the new iPad that Samsung accuses of infringing on several Samsung patents.Samsung reportedly threatened to sue Apple last month for patent infringement over its then rumored use of long-term evolution (LTE) connectivity in the next-generation smartphone. While the new iPhone's debut last month confirmed that Apple's new device featured access to the the speedier fourth-generation wireless networking -- for which Samsung holds numerous patents -- Samsung's latest lawsuit did not address the LTE patentsA Samsung representative told CNET this evening that the eight patents in question include six utility patents and two standard essential patents unrelated to its LTE patent portfolio (see filing below).Echoing previous statements made in the patent dispute, Samsung said, "we have little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights."CNET has contacted Apple for comment and will update this report when we learn more.In a bit of a one-two punch, Samsung added the iPhone 5 as a legal target after a federal judge issued an order dissolving a three-month-old ban on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the U.S. Samsung's once-flagship device was with stipulation that it could be reversed if Samsung was cleared of infringing on an Apple tablet design patent -- which happened during Apple's overwhelming patent victory over Samsung last month.Updated at 10:45 p.m. PT with more information from Samsung.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is refuting a statement made by members of AntiSec this weekend that they hacked the laptop of an FBI special agent and stole a file containing 12 million Apple device IDs and associated personal information.The FBI also said it did not possess a file containing the data the hackers said they stole.In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the FBI said, “The FBI is aware of published reports alleging that an FBI laptop was compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs was exposed. At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.”In case that wasn’t emphatic enough, the FBI also tweeted:Over the weekend, the hacker group AntiSec released an encrypted file that containing 1 million Apple device IDs and device names that the group said was obtained from an FBI computer they hacked.The hackers said the original file contained 12 million IDs, including personal information, but they released only 1 million (leaving out the personal data) in an encrypted file published on torrent sites.In a lengthy post online, the hackers wrote that last March, they hacked a laptop belonging to an FBI agent named Christopher K. Stangl from the bureau’s Regional Cyber Action Team and the New York FBI office’s Evidence Response Team.The hackers say the IDs were stored in a file on Stangl’s desktop titled “NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv.”The file, according to the hackers, contained a list of more than 12 million Apple iOS devices, including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, names of devices, types of devices, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, ZIP codes, cellphone numbers, and addresses.The hackers suggested in a tweet from the @AnonymousIRC account that the FBI was using the information to track users.But the FBI disputes this. The FBI did not say whether the NCFTA, which was allegedly referred to in the file name the hackers obtained, possessed the data.NCFTA refers to the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance. The NCFTA is a non-profit that was founded in 1997 by FBI agent Dan Larkin as a conduit between private industry and law enforcement agencies to help them exchange data and cooperate on cases.The organization’s members include financial institutions, telecommunications firms, ISPs, and other private industries.The NCFTA did not respond to a call seeking comment.Apple UDIDs are a 40-character alphanumeric string that is unique to each Apple device.The hackers say they released the Apple UDIDs so that people would know that the FBI may be tracking their devices and also because, they wrote in their online post, “we think it’s the right moment to release this knowing that Apple is looking for alternatives for those UDID currently … but well, in this case it’s too late for those concerned owners on the list.”Apple has been criticized for hard-coding the IDs in devices, since they can be misused by application developers and others to identify a user, when combined with other information, and track them. Last April, Apple began rejecting applications that track UDIDs.The Next Web has created a tool for users to check if their Apple UDID is among those that the hackers released.Update 9.6.12: Apple, which had initially declined to comment on the story, released a statement after the FBI released its statement. According to Apple, “The FBI has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization. Additionally, with iOS 6 we introduced a new set of APIs meant to replace the use of the UDID and will soon be banning the use of UDID.”

Smule has done it again. The company behind the ingenious lighter app that took the iPhone by storm a few months ago has launched Ocarina, a networked musical instrument that allows you to listen to songs being played around the world in real time. The app costs 99 cents, and you can grab it here.As an instrument Ocarina has been perfectly executed, and is much more suitable for the iPhone’s screen size than the virtual keyboards and guitars that litter the App Store. To play, you blow into the iPhone’s microphone while fingering notes using the 4 ‘holes’ on the ocarina. Smule says that the microphone can detect subtle variations in air flow, explaining that “unlike other iPhone audio apps, the sound is not pre-compiled but is generated by the notes, gestures and nuance of the individual performer”.And for the vast majority of the population that has no idea how to play an ocarina, the app has another awesome feature: you can listen in on the songs being played on any iPhone worldwide. After selecting the ‘globe’ view, the app presents you with a 3D world littered with a number of little dots presumably representing every active Ocarina. The app will automatically start playing one of these, highlighted by a series of green blobs rising from Earth, each of which corresponds to a note. If you don’t like what you’re listening to, you can hit the ‘next’ button to start playing a new song (you’ll probably be using this button often, as many of the people playing are awful).This is how an iPhone app should be done. As we pointed out in September, too few developers are leveraging the platform’s network effect to differentiate themselves, instead choosing to develop standalone apps that can be easily cloned. By being first to market with this app, Smule has safeguarded itself against the competition: even if another ocarina app comes along that is network compatible, Smule’s application will likely have the largest user base and will be very difficult to catch up with. And if Smule is smart, it’ll keep making these virtual instruments, allowing it to share the same network to create a worldwide orchestra that would be nearly impossible to replicate (and it sounds like it will – the company has developed an audio platform called ChucK that will likely be applied to other instruments).For another app that is trying to tap into the iPhone’s network effect, check out Chess With Friends, which we covered yesterday.

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureThe EU is readying a new set of directives that could spell trouble for Apple's iPhone and any other gadget that lacks an easily removable power pack.A new, draft batteries directive mandates that power cells inside electronic devices must be "readily removable" for replacement and safe disposal. This isn't the case with the iPhone, which does not have a user-replaceable battery.Under the terms of the directive, by 2012, at least 25 per cent of all portable batteries - including mobile phone, laptop and car batteries - used annually in each member state must be recycled. By 2016, 45 per cent of them have to be.Mercury, lead and cadmium are by far the most challenging substances in the battery waste stream, the EU says.Although finer details of the removable-battery mandate have not yet been defined - is it sufficient for the supplier to be able to remove a product's battery? - Gary Nevison of Leeds-based repair services company Premier Farnell believes the requirement is "clearly intended to ensure that users can remove batteries by opening a cover by hand or after removal of one or two screws". ®

Update: The iPhone 2.0 software is now available. Update 2: Top apps by number of downloads is here.Apple’s iPhone App Store is now live, several hours ahead of its rumored 9 am PST launch. To access it, download iTunes 7.7 here. Once iTunes has upgraded, you can access the App Store here.You can “get apps” on iTunes now, but you’ll need the iPhone 2.0 software to actually use them on the iPhone, which isn’t yet available.There are 27 pages of applications currently available. We’ve updating our directory with the more interesting applications now. At first glance, there are very few non-English applications. Another interesting trend – a lot of books are listed as applications, most for $0.99 (I just bought Heart of Darkness, for example).According to Pinch Media, the App Store had 552 applications at launch. 135 of these apps are free, while the remaining 417 range in price from $0.99 to $69.99, with the vast majority ranging between $0.99 and $9.99.Some people are saying they can’t see the app store even after downloading v 7.7 of iTunes and clicking on the link above. Here’s a qik video I took of the store if you can’t access it yourself:Here are screen shots of the Facebook and MySpace App on iTunes, as well as one of the directory pages:

For those who don't know, Apple and AT&T removed an application that allowed your iPhone to interface with Google Voice. But, in removing GV Mobile from the app store, Apple has cut the application off from any future updates or bug fixes. The reality is that Apple took your money, and has interfered in your ability to get updates to a program you purchased.If you ask for a refund, Apple will happily refund your money, but, here's the stark reality of such a decision... The author, who received 70% of the purchase price when you bought the software, now has to refund 100% of the purchase price when you ask for a refund. In real numbers, The author made $2.09 on a $2.99 program. But, we has to give BACK $2.99--actually costing the author 90 cents for you to get a refund! Apple keeps the 90 cents profit no matter what.So, you want compensation, but you don't want to hurt the author? Here’s what I did.. This hurts APPLE and not the author! I called up apple corporate offices and told them that I want my money back as “compensation” — NOT as a refund. I was very specific that I did not want a refund on the app; that I wanted APPLE to cover my cost. They ended up crediting my account for 5-free song downloads, (Yes, it's a pathetic compensation, but, it’s something.. and it’s something that won’t hurt Sean, but DOES cost Apple money).I spoke to Robert Barger @ Apple Corporate care. You can reach him at 512-674-2500 x 40267. Give him a call and let him know how you feel about what happened.

Samsung appears to have become the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, passing Finland's Nokia, top since 1998, as Samsung Electronics reported record first-quarter results.Though the company did not reveal precise numbers, some analysts reckon that it sold more smartphones – 44.5m – in the first three months of the year than Apple's 35.1m for its iPhone. Overall, they calculated that it shipped 93.5m mobile phones, compared with 82.7m for Nokia.Samsung's estimated total gave it a 30.6% share of the smartphone market. Apple's sales gave it a 24.1% share."Samsung and Apple are out-competing most major rivals, and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two-horse race," said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics.Net profit nearly doubled from a year earlier to a record 5.05tn won (£2.75bn) for the quarter to 31 March. Operating profit also hit a record high, at 5.85tn won, which was in line with expectations.Sales rose 22% from a year earlier to 45.3tn won. Shares in the company jumped by 3%. More than 70% of its operating profit came from the mobile business, which saw a surge in sales of its Galaxy smartphones.But Nokia, which has slipped from top place in both mobile phones and smartphones after being passed by both Apple and Samsung, saw its debt marked down a notch by ratings agency Fitch, to BB+ from BBB-. The agency warned that further downgrades could follow.Last week Nokia announced one of its worst quarterly results ever, blaming tough competition for a €929m net loss as sales plunged, especially in the smartphone market. It said it expects no improvement in the second quarter.Analysts could not agree on how many smartphones Samsung shipped because the company only gave relative numbers for revenue and profit compared to the year-ago quarter. Research company IHS Suppli catalogues the Samsung Galaxy Note, with a 5in screen, as a tablet rather than a phone, lowering the total smartphone numbers below Apple's.Samsung's mobile communications division, which makes smartphones and a range of tablets, generated 4.27tn won of operating profit in the quarter after seeing significant sales growth of high-end smartphones in developing markets including China, a key battlefield for mobile phone makers.However Apple's iPhone and iPad business remains more lucrative. The Cupertino, California-based company earned $11.6bn (£7.2bn) in the January-March quarter, more than twice as much as Samsung, even though its revenue was about 10% less.

At PDC 2009, Microsoft demonstrated Silverlight video streaming to an iPhone. While Microsoft user experience platform manager Brian Goldfarb said that Microsoft "worked with Apple" to make it happen, don't expect plug-ins for Mobile Safari to start flooding the App Store. Instead, Microsoft worked to make its IIS7 server software capable of sending an QuickTime-compatible stream to an iPhone embedded with a HTML5 tag.Though Silverlight is more than just a video format—it's more of .NET authoring runtime for web-based applications, much like Flash as become—its media delivery features are what content providers wanted on the iPhone. "The promise of Silverlight is that it's a cross-device, cross-browser, cross-platform solution, and it works the same on Macs as it does on Windows," Goldfarb told BetaNews. "The iPhone is a unique scenario. We talked to our customers...and they said, 'Look, we just need to get our content there, and it's mainly in the media space like broadcasting, and we want to put it on the iPhone.'"The true extent of "working with Apple," though, has more to do with making sure the system would work and that Apple didn't disapprove. "We did all the work," Goldfarb said. "We just made sure Apple was comfortable with it. We have to have a strong partnership with our partners, we have to have trust, and that's key."What Microsoft did was enable IIS Media Services respond to requests from an iPhone and transcode on-demand to H.264 format in an MPEG-2 transport stream, the exact same format used by Apple's proposed HTTP Live Streaming protocol. "So it's the same IIS smooth streaming content, the same server, the same point of origin, but now I can get that content to play without any code changes, without any real work, on the iPhone," Goldfarb explained. "That's the critical thing for our customers."We won't be seeing an Silverlight runtime (nor a Flash one, for that matter) popping up on the iPhone. But content providers already using or considering IIS Media Services won't have to encode video separately or maintain a separate content delivery system for serving their content to the hottest mobile platform. So the real question is, when can I start streaming Netflix to my iPhone?

While the Nokia Lumia 900 is the best Windows Phone currently available, and was formerly a gdgt Must-Have model, we've changed our stance on the phone for one simple reason: Microsoft has announced that current Windows Phone models won't be able to run the next version, Windows Phone 8. Based on this, we can't recommend locking yourself into a two-year contract for a phone that won't be able to take advantage of the latest software long before the end of that term. It's possible that, with deep discounts, you can get a good deal on the Lumia 900 (we've seen it on Amazon Wireless for about $50 with a two-year AT&T contract), and if you're content with the functionality available in Windows Phone 7 (the phone will be updated to at least WP 7.8), it could still be worth buying. But that doesn't make it a Must-Have smartphone.

Apple is making it more difficult for iPhone 4 owners to perform simple DIY repairs by replacing common Phillps head screws with a rare "pentalobe" screws. While newer iPhone 4s have included the screws from the factory, it is also Apple policy to replace any Phillips head screws with the new pentalobe screws whenever an iPhone 4 is taken in for service."This screw head clearly has one purpose," iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens told Ars. "To keep you out."News of the strange screw first started appearing last November, when users began noticing that serviced iPhone 4s had something other than Phillips head screws on them. 9to5Mac originally speculated that the screws were a form of Torx screw common to many Apple devices, but later noted that they were in fact some else entirely.iFixit discovered the odd screws much earlier, as iPhone 4s shipped to Japan on launch had the strange new screw. A little investigation revealed that "it is not a standard Torx, and there are no readily available screwdrivers that can remove it," Wiens said."[Apple] chose this 'pentalobe' fastener specifically because it was new, guaranteeing repair tools would be both rare and expensive," Wiens explained. He also noted that the screws are only used on the exterior of the device, merely to make it difficult for end users to get inside. "Otherwise," Wiens said, "Apple would use it throughout each device."Wiens said that Apple had used a similar screw on early unibody MacBook Pros to secure the integrated battery, but later adopted a tri-wing screw for that purpose. The latest MacBook Airs, however, also use pentalobe screws on the outside case, making it difficult to perform what would otherwise be a simple swap of the SSD, for instance.iFixit is doing what it can to source screwdrivers to work with the new screws, though it notes that there doesn't appear to be a single reputable supplier that carries the same tools Apple technicians use. The company offers a kit for iPhone 4 owners with a small driver than can remove the pentalobe screws along with replacement Phillips screws and #00 Phillips screwdriver. Wiens notes that the pentalobe driver isn't perfect—"the tip is more star-shaped than "flowery"—but it can remove Apple's pesky replacements and "liberate" your iPhone.For MacBook Air owners, iFixit also offers a "5-point" screwdriver that is also more star-shaped, but can remove the pentalobe screws Apple uses on the exterior case. Wiens told Ars that the larger size of the head means that the driver can also be used to screw the case back together without danger of damage to the screws (unlike the tiny ones used in the iPhone 4)."This is terrible for consumers," Wiens said. "Apple is taking planned obsolescence to the next level."

Services like Ustream and Qik have long offered the promise of live streaming video from your mobile phone to the web — except if you had an iPhone. For those devices, that was only possible if you jailbroke your phone. Not anymore.The Ustream Live Broadcaster has just gone live in the App Store tonight and yes, it allows you to stream live video from the iPhone to the web. And yes, it even works over a 3G connection. And yes, it’s awesome.While one of the key features of the iPhone 3GS was video recording capabilities, that was limited to recordings that were captured on your device and could be uploaded to the web after they were done recording. With the Ustream Live Broadcaster, you can easily record videos right to the web, and allow others to watch them as they’re being recorded. These videos can also be archived so that people can watch them later, if they choose.Settings within the app also make it easy to automatically tweet out when you go live, as well as to do things like share the videos on Facebook and YouTube. The live broadcast can also send out your location, if you’re into that sort of thing. The app also allows for chatting with viewers, and yes/no polling.Ustream has long promised that it would be the first to allow for live video streaming on the iPhone, and it looks like they’ve finally come through — though almost a year after we first wrote about it. They’ve had an iPhone app out for a while, but it hasn’t had live capabilities until now. Qik has had a live-streaming app, but it was only an ad-hoc app, meaning it wasn’t available in the App Store.This Ustream app’s approval follows the approval of another live video streaming app, Knocking, after the developers emailed Steve Jobs personally about its rejection. But that app only does one-to-one streaming, this does one-to-many — full-on broadcast.Find the Ustream Live Broadcaster in the App Store here for free.

A watchdog group is calling on Apple to demand improvements from its suppliers ahead of releasing its next iPhone. The group says it's already brought in 35,000 signatures.A new online petition is demanding that Apple clean up its act overseas in time to make its next iPhone "the first ethical iPhone."Watchdog group SumOfUs last week put up a petition asking Apple to "make the iPhone 5 ethically," referring to the company's use of overseas manufacturing from companies such as Foxconn, which have recently come under fire for their working conditions and practices.The petition, which the group says garnered more than 35,000 signatures in its first 24 hours, asks Apple to "overhaul the way its suppliers treat their workers," ahead of the release of its next smartphone, which is expected later this year."Can Apple do this? Absolutely," the petition reads. "According to an anonymous Apple executive quoted in The New York Times, all Apple has to do is demand it, and it'll happen."Overseas manufacturers came under fire last week with a pair of investigative stories published by The New York Times that lambasted Apple for poor worker labor and safety issues in its supplier facilities, as well as using cut-throat business practices that prohibited those manufacturers from making improvements.Apple did not respond to the reports in the press, though an internal memo from Apple CEO Tim Cook that leaked last week argued to employees that "any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us.""If Tim Cook is really offended by these allegations, why isn't he doing anything to fix the problems?" Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, executive director of SumOfUs, asked in a statement. "This is the supply chain he set up as COO--he needs to start taking responsibility, not blaming the messenger."This is the latest in a series of petitions targeting Apple, though it is less product-focused. One that launched early last year called on the company to remove a homophobic application from the App Store, a move that resulted in it getting pulled. Two others just a few months ago took aim at the company for the Siri voice assistant application on the iPhone 4S not being able to direct users towards an abortion clinic, which Apple referred to as a "glitch."

...for your own goodFree whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple has applied for a patent covering an elaborate series of measures to automatically protect iPhone owners from thieves and other unauthorized users. But please withhold the applause.The patent, titled “Systems and Methods for Identifying Unauthorized Users of an Electronic Device,” would also protect Apple against jailbreaks and other unauthorized hacks to the device, which were recently excepted from copyright enforcement.The application, which was filed in February and published Thursday, specifically describes the identification of “hacking, jailbreaking, unlocking, or removal of a SIM card” so that measures can be taken to counter the user. Possible responses include surreptitiously activating the iPhone's camera, geotagging the image and uploading it to a server and transmitting sensitive data to a server and then wiping it from the device.Rest assured that this jailbreaking identification, the application would have us believe, is simply a means of protecting owners from unauthorized users.“Access to sensitive information such as credit card information, social security numbers, banking information, home addresses, or any other delicate information can be prohibited,” the application states. “In some embodiments, the sensitive information can be erased from the electronic device. For example, the sensitive information can be erased directly after an unauthorized user is detected.”But elsewhere, the patent betrays ulterior motives that are considerably more self serving.“An activity that can detect an unauthorized user can be any action that may indicate the electronic device is being tampered with by being, for example, hacked, jailbroken, or unlocked,” the patent continues. “For example, a sudden increase in memory usage of the electronic device can indicate that a hacking program is being run and that an unauthorized user may be using the electronic device.“'Jailbreaking' of an electronic device can generally refer to tampering with the device to allow a user to gain access to digital resources that are normally hidden and protected from users. 'Unlocking' of a cellular phone can generally refer to removing a restriction that 'locks' a cellular phone so it may only be used in specific countries or with specific network providers. Thus, in some embodiments, an unauthorized user can be detected if it is determined that the electronic device is being jailbroken or unlocked.”The application describes plenty of bells and whistles. They include voice-printing of the owner to detect unauthorized users (what could possibly go wrong with that?), activating the accelerometer to detect if thieves are in transit – even a “heartbeat sensor.”Ignoring the possibility that a false positive in Apple's proposed theft protection might activate the spy cam while the user is in the bath, or in the middle of some other intimate moment, this technology seems Orwellian for another reason: It gives Steve jobs and Co. the means to retaliate when iPhones aren't being used in ways Cupertino doesn't expressly permit.But remember, it's for your own good. ®

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

More Google Android phones were sold during the first quarter of 2010 in the U.S. than iPhones. Customers of Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. carrier in terms of subscribers, can’t buy an iPhone, but they can choose from a wide range of different Google Android smartphones.More handsets sold in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010 were running atop Google’s Android than Apple’s iPhone operating system, according to the latest findings of The NPD Group. Android smartphones accounted for 28 percent of sales; the iPhone, just 21 percent (both still lagged behind Research In Motion’s BlackBerry platform, which was the market leader at 36 percent). So what’s propelling Android past the iPhone?There’s the obvious explanation: Exclusivity on AT&T’s network limits the potential sales for Apple. As Verizon announced on its most recent quarterly earnings call, it has more than 92.8 million subscribers, none of which can buy an iPhone for use on the network — although a recent poll found that a majority of them want one. Enter Google Android phones, whose user interfaces are similar to the iPhone and have access to a growing software store, now estimated at 50,000 applications. Verizon is helping the Android cause, too — it devoted $100 million in advertising muscle to back the Android-powered Motorola Droid.An additional factor is the number of handset choices. By providing its Android operating system to any hardware manufacturer that wants it, Google allows for a near limitless number of handset variances for consumers to choose from. iPhone selection, on the other hand, is akin to choosing the paint color of the old Ford Model T’s that only came in black — you can have any iPhone model you like right now, so long as it’s an iPhone 3G or 3GS.Finally, the many permutations of Android devices offers another advantage — pricing flexibility based on the hardware used and the features offered. The NPD Group cites an average smartphone price of $151 in the first quarter of 2010, roughly half of the $299 price tag for a top-shelf iPhone. Apple offers subsidized models at $99 and $199, but most subsidized Android phone prices top out at $199 and go down from there. The Samsung Behold 2 running Android is currently free with a service plan at T-Mobile, for example. With so many choices, consumers can find Android units for well under $99 these days and can shop around in a greater range of price points.

The CES 2010 did not officially start yet, but the Parrot AR.Drone already made it on my short list of CES 2010 coolest products. The Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter piloted with an iPhone or iPod touch that carries two cameras that deliver live video feed onto your iPhone. How bloody cool is that? (watch video below). Parrot is positioning the Parrot AR.Drone as a video game for the iPhone. It combines wireless, video and gaming technologies to allow real-world objects and conditions, like a tree or wind, to become a part of the video gaming experience.Parrot AR.Drone is a quadricopter that consists of a central cockpit surrounded by four propellers. One camera located underneath, connects to an Inertial Measurement Unit, which allows the AR.Drone to measure its speed and perform flawless stationary flight. Parrot Smart Piloting (PSP) technology compensates for wind and other environmental conditions during outside flights. For the first time, these technologies, used primarily for professional and military applications, have been adapted to the gaming universe. The second camera, at the front, broadcasts and streams to the iPhone or iPod touch screen, what the AR.Drone sees, as if you were sitting in the cockpit. This allows for the augmented reality gaming experience. The Parrot AR.Drone generates its own Wi-Fi network that simply connects to an iPhone or iPod touch and turns it into a true piloting station. I am not even sure if the U.S. Army has a better drone than this. Pricing has not been announced yet for Parrot AR.Drone. I hope it will be below $200. Parrot launches the iPhone Drone later this year. The company is more known for Bluetooth gear, but with the AR.Drone they could land a huge hit. I certainly want a AR.Drone when it is out for my iPhone. See also these hi-res photos. Game developers are invited to creating games for the Parrot AR.Drone on the open platform that Parrot provides for it. More details can be found on the Parrot AR.Drone site.

Verizon has quietly begun throttling the wireless connections of its heaviest data users, the company revealed in a PDF buried on its website (hat tip to BGR). The document explains that Verizon has begun two new network management practices in order to "provide the best experience to our more than 94 million customers," and that they go into effect starting today, February 3.In the document, Verizon says it's using techniques such as caching less data on its network, reducing network capacity, and sizing video "more appropriately" for devices. "While we invest much effort to avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as displayed on your device," Verizon writes.The company also insists that the process is content-agnostic—likely to avoid the outrage that came when Comcast began throttling Bit Torrent users. Verizon's PDF points to www.verizonwireless.com/vzwoptimization for a more detailed explanation of its optimization "techniques," but as of this writing, that page remains unavailable on Verizon's site.Along with video compression, Verizon is now reducing data throughput speeds for customers that fall into the five percent of customers who "use an extraordinary amount of data." The throttling could last through the remainder of the current billing cycle and the next one, so those who find their data speeds being held back may end up suffering the consequences for months afterwards."Our proactive management of the Verizon Wireless network is designed to ensure that the remaining 95 percent of data customers aren't negatively affected by the inordinate data consumption of just a few users," the company wrote.The timing for Verizon's new throttling policies is no coincidence; today is also the day the carrier began accepting preorders for the long-awaited Verizon iPhone 4. Verizon will undoubtedly begin to feel the weight of iPhone users' browsing habits when the device becomes available to customers on February 10, just as AT&T did when the iPhone first launched on its network in 2007.It took AT&T years of building out its network to better handle the load, and Verizon knows that it needs to balance things out from the beginning. After all, a study from last July showed that Verizon 3G users gobbled about 25 percent more data than iPhone users did—now that Verizon's about to have its old customers and new iPhone users snarfing down data like no tomorrow, network management has apparently become a bigger priority.Another point of note is Verizon's position on the latest net neutrality rules. The company sued the Federal Communications Commission last month to block the rules from taking effect, even though they are comparatively light on wireless communications. Still, with the decision to throttle heavy data users, Verizon is obeying what's outlined in the FCC rules by making sure the implementation is site- and content-agnostic, as well as by being transparent about its practices. The company knows that the move isn't likely to be popular, so it's trying to offer as much information as it can so that users can understand better what's going on behind the scenes.

Seventeen mobile phone manufacturers and operators have committed to develop standard for universal cell phone chargers by 2012.The initiative, led by the European mobile communications organization GSMA, seeks to adopt a universal connection and a common energy-efficient format that could result in an estimated 50 percent reduction in standby energy consumption and tens of thousands of tons of duplicate chargers.The group said phones would have a micro USB interface, currently used by some phones and by other devices such as digital cameras.Universal chargers would also make life easier for consumers, the GSMA said. Phones could be shipped cheaper, with no charger cord, since eventually most consumers would have one. And consumers would not be left with drawers of old chargers to sort through.Some of the industry’s biggest players are not included in the group, however, including Cupertino-based Apple Inc., whose popular iPhone uses a proprietary 30-pin cable; Sunnyvale-based Palm Inc.; and Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry smart phone tops the market.The companies that have joined the initiative are AT&T, KTF, LG, mobilkom austria, Motorola, Nokia, Orange, Qualcomm, Samsung3 Group, Sony Ericsson, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telenor, Telstra, T-Mobile and Vodafone.

Pre-orders for the iPhone 5 went live at midnight and, true to form, they went like hotcakes. You may remember that it took 22 hours for the iPhone 4S and about 20 hours for the iPhone 4 to sell out of its pre-order, launch-day stock.The iPhone 5 took just about 60 minutes. Yep. One hour after pre-orders went live, Apple.com adjusted shipping expectations from one to two weeks due to the overwhelming demand.Demand for the phone caused problems on Apple’s website and several of the wireless carriers’ sites, as many users were met with error messages when they attempted to pre-order the new iPhone. There’s always plenty of hubbub around Apple product launches, though the pre-order launch of the iPhone 4S came and went without problems on Apple.com or carrier sites. It wouldn’t be surprising if this turns out to be an indication of what’s to come.All summer we were subjected to seemingly endless speculation and rumors regarding every last detail of the new, new iPhone. But, when it was finally unveiled this week, the reviews — which, while still characterized by the usual fanboi excitement — seemed more lukewarm than in years past. Even compared to the recent iPad/Mac event.As is so often the case with Apple, the new phone looks great, with the bigger screen and improved speed ranking as my personal favorites. Yet, that being said, I haven’t yet seen the kind of mind-melting innovation and improvement that would justify pre-orders 20 times faster than the 4 and 4S.Nonetheless, people are still ready to buy it in what will no doubt be massive numbers.“Available to ship: 2 weeks”… man that last week it’s gonna feel like you have an old cement block in your pocket.I guess I shouldn’t be surprised anymore that Apple product launches somehow continue to exceed expectations, the machine reliably churning out another hit. But I am. Mostly because of how rampant the obsession is to buy the next generation of iPhone as soon as possible.MG Siegler wrote yesterday about the way Apple showcases these events, discussing the turn and the prestige. But a couple of sentences really jumped out at me beyond the presentation of the phone.That’s what really matters. The bottom line sits atop everything else. And the bottom line is that, despite the phone not having any of those drastic changes some hoped for (NFC?) and a lack of an overwhelming “wow” factor, so many people went online at midnight or past — on a work night no less — to shell out hundreds of dollars for a pre-order jubilee that had sites crashing and the first batch selling out in 60 minutes.That’s why Apple is the most valuable company in the world.The question is: The iPhone 4S had Siri, which captured our attention in full, even if she’s been a disappointment since … so what feature or tool will be that for the 5?Update: The ship time on Apple’s site is now 2-3 weeks:And Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told AllThingsD: “Pre-orders for iPhone 5 have been incredible. We’ve been completely blown away by the customer response.”

The bizarre gathering, which morphed into a spirited Michael Jackson "Thriller" dance routine, marked the completion of its Windows Phone 7 software, and showed how badly Microsoft wants to resurrect itself in the viciously competitive phone market.The new software, which will be publicly unveiled on October 11 and expected on handsets in stores by November, is Microsoft's last chance, some analysts say, to catch up with Apple and Google Inc's Android smartphones, after squandering its strong market position in only a few years.A group of smartphone manufacturers including Samsung and HTC Corp are expected to roll out Microsoft-based phones for the holiday season.Whether they will be good enough to render the iPhone obsolete is the question."The product can't be an also-ran that just does everything that is already out in the marketplace," said Bryan Keane, an analyst for Alpine Mutual Funds, which holds Microsoft shares. "Right now, it isn't apparent that Windows 7 is better than anything that's out there, except that it might have a better tie-in to the actual Windows platform."By the admission of Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, the company "missed a generation" with Windows Mobile, its last phone operating system, which floundered while the iPhone and Android roared past with sumptuous touch screens and a host of new applications.Microsoft is now fourth in the fast-growing U.S. market for smartphone operating systems with a share of less than 12 percent, according to research firm comScore, behind BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd, Apple and Google.Microsoft's strange disappearance from the phone market, and its delayed response to the emergence of tablet devices like Apple's iPad, has been seen as a drag on Microsoft's shares, which are down 20 percent this year."The market is really fearful of their positioning in those two markets (phones and tablets)," said Ken Allen, Baltimore-based portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, which holds Microsoft shares. "Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock."Investors were not impressed with Microsoft's last attempt to launch a new phone, the Kin, which was dropped after fewer than three months on the market.Whether the new phones can make up for that error and lift concerns will depend on how the handsets measure up and how much the network carriers promote the phones.Prototypes of the new devices, which have been demonstrated by Microsoft employees over the past few months, look to be a huge improvement over the last version of Microsoft's phone software. They have a touch-screen interface resembling the company's Zune music player and movable 'tiles' that access various phone functions.But at first glance, they don't appear to offer radical new features that rivals lack.Launch phones are expected from Samsung, LG and HTC Corp, while AT&T Inc is expected to be the initial U.S. network provider, according to a person familiar with the launch plans. Microsoft and AT&T declined comment. None of the handset makers immediately replied to requests for details.All three of those phone makers already offer Android-based phones, while AT&T is currently the sole carrier for the iPhone, which means none has too much riding on the success of the new software, which could be a problem for Microsoft."We'll have to see how much vendor support (Microsoft) gets behind it -- that was partially what drove Android success," said Keane at Alpine. "But now, their problem is, 'We already have Android and the iPhone, do we need a third one?'."

In the last five weeks, Apple has revamped its entire product lineup with new iPods, iPhones and computers. But on Thursday it said those products would be more expensive to make, nibbling into its ample profits.That forecast for the holiday quarter was the main blemish on an otherwise solid financial report. Apple said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 24 percent, largely because of a surge in sales of the iPhone, a product that now accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales.The quarter ended Sept. 29 was the first to reflect sales of the iPhone 5, which was introduced Sept. 21. Apple has struggled to deliver enough of the devices to meet customer demand, making them tough to find in many retail stores. The company’s shares have fallen 9 percent since the product hit the market, in part because of investor concerns about short supply.In a conference call with analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said that demand for the new iPhone was “extremely robust” and that the company had a significant number of back orders for it. He said production had picked up substantially since earlier this month.The profit report was slightly below analysts’ expectations, and Apple’s stock was largely unchanged in after-hours trading. It fell 1.2 percent to $609.54 in regular trading.Underscoring how drastically Apple’s business has been transformed by mobile products, revenue from the iPhone rose 56 percent to $17.13 billion, making up 48 percent of the company’s total revenue. It sold 26.9 million iPhones, 58 percent more than a year earlier.Apple said its net income was $8.22 billion, or $8.67 a share, compared with $6.62 billion, or $7.05 a share, a year ago. Revenue for the period rose 27 percent to $35.97 billion, and revenue for the full fiscal year was $156.5 billion. To put that in perspective, Apple’s revenue for the year exceeded that of Microsoft, Google and Facebook combined.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Apple to report earnings of $8.75 a share and revenue of $35.8 billion. The results were well ahead of Apple’s own forecast of $7.65 a share in earnings and $34 billion in revenue for the period.It was the company’s projections for its current holiday quarter that raised eyebrows among investors. The company forecast earnings of $11.75 a share and revenue of $52 billion for the period, typically its biggest of the year. That implied a gross profit margin of 36 percent, lower than the 40 percent margin Apple reported in the fourth quarter, said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Apple executives attributed the decline to higher costs associated with building its new products, which tend to get less expensive over time as Apple gets better at manufacturing them. While this pattern is familiar, the company said the sheer magnitude of its product-line overhaul made the decline in gross margin more severe. In addition to the new iPhone and iPods, Apple has announced new Macs and a smaller version of the iPad, called the iPad Mini.Mr. Cihra said the company might be lowballing its estimates. “They have a history of beating their guidance,” he said.Apple said its revenue from the iPad rose 9 percent to $7.51 billion.As with most Apple products, the iPad Mini’s arrival was widely anticipated after months of rumors and leaks about the product in the news media. Mr. Cook said the rumors led people to postpone tablet purchases.At the iPad Mini event, Apple hinted that sales of the iPad had been slower than expected when it revealed that the company had sold 100 million of the devices since their introduction two years ago, causing some analysts to trim their forecasts for the quarter.“I think on balance it was pretty in line with reduced expectations,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.At a starting price of $329, the iPad Mini is more expensive than many people were hoping, and well above the sub-$200 bar for smaller tablets set by Amazon and Google. But the device could still open the iPad to a new swath of customers who were put off by the larger size of the original.

It's always refreshing to hear the head of a major corporation cop to past mistakes -- particularly in front of a large crowd of on-lookers. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson admitted some misgivings about the way the carrier handled iPhone data, telling a crowd at the Milken Institute's Global Conference in Los Angeles, "My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat." Stephenson drove the point home by adding, "Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital."And, for the record, that certainly wasn't the only thing about the iPhone that kept the exec up at night. Stephenson again,You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model," he said. "Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you're using iMessage, you're not using one of our messaging services, right?No one ahead said it was easy being the chief.

Private information stored in Apple's iPhone and protected by a lock code can be accessed by anyone with just a few button presses.The iPhone, like most mobile phones, can be locked with a four-digit code, but where other phones in their locked state only permit calls to emergency service numbers such as 911 (in the U.S.), 999 (in the U.K.) and 112 (throughout Europe), a locked iPhone can be used to make a call to any number.[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes' Security Adviser blog and newsletter, both from InfoWorld. ]However, that's not all you can do with a locked iPhone running the latest version of Apple's software, 2.0.2.Pressing the emergency call button at the unlock screen, followed by two taps on the home button, takes you to the iPhone's private 'favorites' page without the need to enter the unlock code. If the owner of the phone has favorite entries in their address book containing URLs, e-mail addresses or mobile phone numbers, then those entries can be used to launch the browser, mail application or SMS (Short Message Service) software, and gain access to private Web favorites, e-mail messages, and text messages stored in the phone, again without entering the unlock code.The security flaw, revealed by a member of the MacRumors.com forum, came as a surprise to an Apple spokeswoman in London, who said she would look into the matter.One way to avoid such unauthorized access to e-mail messages or Web favorites would be not to add e-mail addresses or URLs to favorite address book entries.Apple pushed version 2.0 of its iPhone software as being more enterprise-friendly: some businesses had been reluctant to adopt the first version of the iPhone because it did not adequately protect corporate information stored in the device.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — A federal judge says a monopoly abuse lawsuit against Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc.'s mobile phone unit can move forward as a class action.The lawsuit consolidates several filed by iPhone buyers starting in late 2007, a few months after the first generation of Apple's smart phone went on sale.An amended complaint filed in June 2008 takes issue with Apple's practice of "locking" iPhones so they can only be used on AT&T's network, and its absolute control over what applications iPhone owners can and cannot install on the gadgets.The lawsuit also says Apple secretly made AT&T its exclusive iPhone partner in the U.S. for five years. Consumers agreed to two-year contracts with the Dallas-based wireless carrier when they purchased their phones, but were in effect locked into a five-year relationship with AT&T, the lawsuit argued.The actions hurt competition and drove up prices for consumers, the lawsuit claims.Apple and AT&T have not commented on the terms of their deal. In its response to the complaint, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it did not hurt competition.In court documents filed July 8, Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said parts of the lawsuit that deal with violations to antitrust law can continue as a class action. The class includes anyone who bought an iPhone with a two-year AT&T agreement since the device first went on sale in June 2007.Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones in the last three years. The company does not specify how many have gone to U.S. customers.Ware dismissed other claims against Apple, among them allegations that the company broke laws when an update to the iPhone's operating software caused some phones to stop working and deleted programs that users had purchased.The lawsuit seeks an injunction to keep Apple from selling locked iPhones in the U.S. and from determining what iPhone programs people can install. It also seeks damages to cover legal fees and other costs.

A Scottish IP firm is suing Apple over the smooth zooming and scrolling featured on the iPhone.Glasgow-based patent licenser Picsel Technologies says the Cupertino iDevice maker illegally uses display technologies it developed. The firm sued Apple on Friday in Delaware District Court.Picsel claims Apple infringes on its US patent 7,009,626, titled "Systems and Methods for Generating Visual Representations of Graphical Data and Digital Document Processing."The patent describes using an approximate, intermediary rendering of what's displayed on a device while scrolling, zooming, or during other major screen transitions.For example, if a user zooms into a particular object on a device's web browser, the transition is done by showing an approximation of what the final display will look like using scaled data from the page before the zoom.Picsel claims it has spent millions of dollars developing the technology for the patent, which the USPTO approved on March 7, 2006.The company also alleges that Apple knowingly and deliberately infringes on patent '626 with devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, although the initial complaint doesn't provide evidence for this claim.Picsel says the IP has been baked into more than 200 million devices worldwide. Its website lists companies like Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, Panasonic, Palm, HP, Motorola, and Nokia as licensing partners.It appears many of the technologies the firm makes are produced in-house - not collected from other inventors.The complaint asks for a block on allegedly infringing Apple products, unspecified damages, that patent damages be increased to three times the amount awarded, and attorneys fees.A copy of the lawsuit is available here. ®

FRUIT THEMED FIRM Apple's Iphone and Ipad could be banned in Germany after Motorola won a temporary injunction in the Mannheim Regional Court.The case, which relates to Motorola's wireless technology patents, represents a huge loss for Apple in its tit for tat patent battles taking place around the world.However, in typical fashion, Apple immediately said it would appeal the ruling. It said, "We're going to appeal the court's ruling right away. Holiday shoppers in Germany should have no problem finding the iPad or iPhone they want."According to patent gadfly Florian Mueller, the ruling includes an injunction that is preliminarily enforceable against Ireland-based Apple Sales International in exchange for a €100mn (£85.4mn or $134m) bond unless Apple wins a stay.He said on his blog, "Apple is certainly going to appeal this ruling to the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court and to request a stay for the duration of the appellate proceedings. Such a suspension may or may not be granted."Apple suffered another loss today when an Australian court lifted a ban on the Samsung Galaxy Tab in Australia. µ

Several versions of Apple's iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have potentially serious security problems, a German government agency said in an official warning Wednesday.Apple's iOS operating system has "two critical weak points for which no patch exists," the Federal Office for Information Security said.Opening a manipulated website or a PDF file could allow criminals to spy on passwords, planners, photos, text messages, e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations, the agency said in a statement."This allows potential attackers access to the complete system, including administrator rights," it added, urging users not to open PDF files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until Apple Inc. publishes a software update.A spokesman for Apple in Germany, Georg Albrecht, told The Associated Press that the company is looking into the matter."We know these reports and are investigating them," he said, refusing to elaborate.Although no attacks have been observed yet they were likely to appear soon, the German agency said."It has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks," it said, noting that the devices' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world.The warning relates to iPhones using iOS versions 3.1.2-4.0.1., iPads using iOS 3.2-3.2.1 and iPods Touch using iOS 3.1.2.-4.0.The agency said it was possible but not clear whether older iOS or iPhone OS versions could also be affected.The federal agency, based in Bonn, said it was in contact with Apple on the issue.

Responding to a string of complaints, Apple said that the error overstated the phone's signal strength, causing it to appear to lose more reception than it actually does when gripped a certain way.Angry owners said that when they grip it via its lower left-hand corner, the phone drops several bars of signal."We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising," the company wrote in a letter."Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength."Apple's CEO Steve Jobs last week told people complaining about the issue to simply hold their phone a different way.Earlier this week, the company stated that "gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas".It now says the combination of the effect of gripping the phone, plus the error in the way signal is displayed on the iPhone 4, is what is causing some users to report a drop of several bars."Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars."Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place," Apple said Friday.The company said that it wouldl issue a software update within a few weeks to fix the issue, adding: "We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same - the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped."Several users have filed lawsuits over the reception issue.

So I have my Macbook (2008, white, running 10.5.8) set to lock when the lid is shut, prompting me for a password when the computer opens/wakes up. Great. No problem. But occasionally I'll plug my iPhone (3G) into the USB port while the lid is shut to charge overnight. When the phone is plugged in, the computer immediately wakes up - the apple logo glows and the phone begins charging. After a few moments, the light turns off, the comp falls back asleep, and the phone continues charging.Risk I noticed (and repeated to test) this morning.Can any of you test this to see if this is more widespread than a fluke in Austin, TX?

Microsoft and Apple are said to be discussing a deal that would see Microsoft Bing become the default search engine on Apple's iPhone.The move, according to a published report, would result in the ouster of Google as the main search portal on the iPhone.Apple may be looking to ditch Google from its devices in response to Google's launch of an iPhone competitor, dubbed Nexus One, earlier this month, according to BusinessWeek. The story said Microsoft might also be looking to make Bing the default search tool on Apple's Safari Web browser.Like the iPhone, the Nexus One features downloadable apps and an interactive touch screen. But unlike Apple, Google plans to sell an open version of the $529 phone that's not linked to a specific carrier."Apple and Google know the other is their primary enemy," said an anonymous source quoted by BusinessWeek in a story published Wednesday. The magazine said the source had knowledge of Apple's plans.It was not immediately clear how much traffic the iPhone generates for Google, but the number could be significant as the iPhone dominates the North American mobile device market.Microsoft and Apple officials didn't comment for the story.If such a deal plays out, it could provide a marked boost for Microsoft's search business. Bing captured just 10.7% of all U.S. search traffic in December, according to market watcher Comscore, while Google, the number one player, took 65.7% of all traffic. Second place Yahoo grabbed 17.3%.Microsoft already has a deal in place to add Bing to Yahoo's Web pages.Microsoft shares were off 2.03%, to $30.47, in morning trading Wednesday. Apple was down 1.65%, to $211.49, while Google was off by 1.41%, to $579.35, as the markets opened lower on concerns about bank earnings.Still shackling your workers to a standard company PC?

I updated my iPhone 4S earlier today (using the OTA method), and I discovered a nasty bug. My iPhone could no longer remember the names of any of my contacts! I opened up the contacts app on my phone and discovered that all of entries were still there but if I got a text or a call my iPhone would have a sudden bout of amnesia and forget the contacts name.It’s even more bizarre when you’re trying to create a new text. In the example above I texted Erin Hontz. After I selected her as the contact, I wrote my message and hit send. In the message pane (pictured on the right) it would forget my contact’s name and just show the number.I mentioned this on Twitter and many of my followers had similar experiences.• Use the Delta Update (The OTA version) • Be on an iPhone 4S (I haven’t had reports with the 4) • Be On VerizonDisabling (and re-enabling) iCloud contacts did not solve the issue.Have you had any issues upgrading to iOS 5.0.1?This method fixed my incoming calls but not incoming text messages. Your milage may vary. via TSF reader James Foster1) Open the Phone and dial *228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number. 2) When the system answer press 1 for “Program or activate your phone” 3) Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, “Settings updated.” 4) Open the Task Manager (double click the home button) and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications 5) Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe) 6) Open the Message App to verify the fix.If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.

AT&T captivity is the single biggest reason foks who don't buy iPhones don't buy them, so this would be big. It would also be unexpectedly early--most analysts aren't expecting Apple to open up to other carriers until the middle of the year.(We'd be surprised to see Apple actually end the exclusivity on Wednesday, but it seems plausible that they would announce the end...)According to an inside source close to the going-ons involved in all of this, a new tablet of some sort may not be the only thing on deck for next Wednesday though. We have been led to believe by an inside source that AT&T will lose their iPhone exclusivity on the same day, though it's not yet clear what other carrier (or carriers) will be stepping in to also carry the phone.Bonus: 20 guesses about what the Apple tablet will look like >

Let’s step into a time machine and travel through the mists of chronos to an ancient yesteryear. It was a different era, Britney Spears shaved her head, Boris Yeltsin died, and people learned how to print images on toast from the comfort of their own workshops. Oh, and a lil’ thing called an iPhone came out. The year was 2007, and Verizon and Sprint were so scared that they issued these ridiculous sheets to their frontline reps with talking points for discouraging people from buying an iPhone:“Touch screen: It sounds cool, but if you’re a heavy text or email user, it could be challenging not being able to feel the keys as you press them. And how are you going to type without looking with a keyboard you can’t even feel.” “Sorry, iPhone can’t send picture or video message — only e-mail. No over-the-air downloads. You have to connect to a PC to load music.” “Wi-Fi is not a mobile technology. You have to be in a fixed location to use it — and that’s if you know where to find it. And some Wi-Fi hotspots make you pay to use them. There’re also those pesky concerns about security of Wi-Fi.”“The iPhone is an Apple product and has some nice features. It also has a nice price. Do you really need all those features in one device?” “Are you sure 4G or 8G is enough storage for you? To give you a comparison, most iPods/MP3 players hold 40 to 60Gigs or more.” “Using the iPhone on the GSM/EDGE network may be like having a really powerful computer on dial up.”Ok, that last one turned out to be true.

One of the world’s largest oilfield companies, Halliburton, publicly acknowledged its decision to stop giving workers BlackBerrys and start equipping them with iPhones. This is a gigantic blow to Research in Motion because the BlackBerry has for a very long time been widely considered the best phone for enterprise users. Halliburton obviously disagrees and so will many other companies if RIM doesn’t step its game up in time.Spokesperson for Halliburton, Tara Mullee Agard, said to Reuters in an email, “We are making this transition in order to better support our mobile applications initiatives.” The transition she speaks of is the movement from BlackBerry to iPhone over the next two years for 4,500 employees. She also pointed out Apple is helping the company with the process.Apple didn’t just steal a large amount of candy from RIM, it’s getting the dirty pleasure of chewing slowly right in front of RIM.BlackBerry advocates, you are now presented with a challenge: come up with a better excuse than “BlackBerry devices are for business users.” I’m afraid that argument is no longer valid. Oh, and since BlackBerry isn’t so hot with consumers either, what exactly is the target market? Please hurry. The BlackBerry Bold Team is waiting for its next mission.George has followed technology news for quite some time, but he only started writing about it a few years ago. He particularly enjoys covering Apple, but that doesn't stop him from reporting on a wide range of topics in the mobile area.

In an effort to get around Apple's ban on rival browsers for its iPhone, Mozilla plans to offer a Firefox application that will give users access to their browser bookmarks and history. The app will also let users open tabs from their most recent Firefox sessions.The Firefox Home app is a spin-off of the bookmark and tab synchronization technology Mozilla currently offers as an add-on for the Firefox desktop browser. Mozilla will submit the free application to the App Store within the next three weeks. Sadly, Mozilla has no way to know when or if the app will be approved and available to users, so it's hard to say when we'll be able to get our hands on this app.Firefox Home Coming Soon to the iPhoneWe have been working on an application for the iPhone based on the Firefox Sync (formerly Weave Sync) technology. The app is called Firefox Home, and it gives iPhone users instant access to their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks and the set of tabs from their most recent browser session. What’s more, it provides Firefox “Awesome Bar” capability that enables people to get to their favorite web sites with minimal typing.Firefox Home provides an amazing “get up and go” experience. It’s encrypted end-to-end. It’s your home on the Web, wherever you are. And, of course, it’s free.Firefox Home for iPhone is part of a broader Mozilla effort to provide a more personal Web experience with more user control. For devices or platforms where we’re unable to provide the “full” Firefox browser (either technically or due to policy), we aim to provide users with “on the go” instant access to their personal Firefox history, bookmarks and open tabs on their iPhones, giving them another reason to keep loving Firefox on their desktops.Why is this useful?

We always knew the Apple / Samsung lawsuit would produce some major fireworks, and Samsung just lit off a corker: the company filed a motion Friday night asking Apple to turn over the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 as part of the discovery process. Seriously! Samsung claims that it needs to see Apple's future products because devices like the Droid Charge and Galaxy Tab 10.1 will presumably be in the market at the same time as the iPhone 5 and iPad 3, and Samsung's lawyers want to evaluate any possible similarities so they can prepare for further potential legal action from Apple. It's ballsy, but it's not totally out of the blue: the move comes just a few days after the judge ordered Samsung to hand over pre-production samples of the Droid Charge, Infuse 4G, Galaxy S II, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 so Apple could determine if those products should also be part of the lawsuit and potentially file a motion to block them from the market.Now, the key difference between the two requests is that Samsung had already announced its products, while Apple has maintained its traditional iron silence about future devices. But there's some additional nuance involved as well, as well as some bigger-picture implications -- let's walk through the entire situation, shall we?Now, given that most of the Samsung products on the list were already either available or fully disclosed, it wasn't surprising that Apple won -- in fact, it's more interesting that Samsung had chose to fight back on such a minor issue in the first place, since it had so little at stake. (And it's also somewhat interesting that Apple even asked for Samsung's products in discovery instead of just filing for an injunction from the get-go, since they had all been announced already.) It's a tell: no little compromises means no big compromises are in the works. So now let's step through Samsung's motion to see the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 and try to get a sense of what's actually happening in context.So that's Samsung's motion. It's pretty strange, if you think about it: Samsung is arguing that Apple might file for a preliminary injunction, and that it might happen sometime after Apple might release a new iPhone and iPad. That's a lot of assumptions -- and Apple can basically kill this entire line of argument dead by filing for that injunction Monday morning and saying that Samsung's already-announced products should be blocked from market because they'll cause confusion with the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 for however many months remain before the new versions are released. Neither the court nor Samsung really need to see Apple's unreleased products to deal with that. And even if Samsung wins, Apple will definitely appeal the decision, putting the entire case on hold while things get sorted out... a process that will almost certainly stretch past the iPhone 5's expected release in the fall, rendering this entire argument somewhat moot. And what happens if Samsung eventually gets the iPhone 5 and determines that the Droid Charge infringes Apple's patents and trademarks? Is it going to change the Droid Charge? The potential outcomes aren't entirely favorable here.So why is Samsung even pursuing this? I think it's a calculated gamble for additional leverage. Apple and Samsung held negotiations for a year before giving up and heading to the courts, and I'm reliably informed that there haven't been any substantive settlement discussions since Apple first filed its complaint. That means talks have been at a standstill for a long time now, and I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung was trying to put some additional heat on Apple to try and kick negotiations back into gear. It's an interesting and aggressive move in its own right, but it also highlights the fact that neither Apple nor Samsung have addressed the actual merits of their complaints in formal replies -- this is a minor skirmish before the real battle begins. We'll see if this sideshow accomplishes anything beyond clever lawyerly maneuvering, but for right now it's clear that Apple and Samsung aren't planning to back down anytime soon.

Android has officially hit the big time now that sales of its devices exceeded the Apple iPhoneover the past quarter.Briefly, a look at the numbers: Over the span of a mere quarter last year, Android saw its share of the U.S. smartphone market more than double, as the platform was used on more than 7% of all U.S. smartphones at the end of 2009. The most recent research released by the NPD Group showed that Android-based phonesin the first quarter of 2010 accounted for 28% of all smartphone shipments, trailing only Research in Motion's BlackBerry operating system, which accounted for 36% of all smartphone shipments in the quarter. And finally, Android-based phones are now available on all four major U.S. wireless carriers, with the million-selling Motorola Droid so far serving as the platform's flagship device.So how did this all come together so quickly? Looking back over the past three years, it seems that Google had a very simple but effective plan to push its way into a crowded market. Using a combination of free software, design simplicity and brand clout, Google has succeeded in making an operating system that, in just a couple of years, has grown to rival the most popular mobile platforms in the business. Let's take a look at each element piece by piece:* First, make it free. One of the most enticing aspects of Android from both a software developer and a device manufacturer perspective is that it's completely free to use, as Google charges no licensing fees for anyone who wants to base their device or application on Android. This is a distinctly different path than the ones taken by Apple and Research in Motion, which both only allow use of their operating systems on their own devices, and by Microsoft, which only allows devices to use Windows Mobile through a licensing agreement.* Second, keep it simple. When Google went about attracting application developers to its new platform, it made a big deal about the Android software development kit's ease of use. And since Android is Linux platform that uses Java as its programming language, most software developers on the market haven't had much difficulty in writing programs for the operating system.Google has also gone out of its way to make posting a new application on the Android Market a snap, as the company does not screen any applications sent to the store and will only remove applications if it has received legitimate customer complaints about them."We created an account, uploaded our apps and then hit submit," said Ilya Eliashevsky, the product manager for app developer DataViz's Android product line, last year. "Then the app just started showing up on devices and we saw sales immediately starting to roll in."* Finally, be Google. There have been ambitious platform developers in the past who have tried to mainstream open source in the mobile OS market, but none of them so far have had the market clout of Google. Google's brand recognition not only helps it attract media attention to its initiatives but also helps it more quickly develop relationships with device manufacturers, carriers and app developers. In other words, while you obviously need to develop a strong mobile platform that device manufacturers, software developers and consumers want to use, it doesn't hurt to be the world's No.1 search engine either.Read more about anti-malware in Network World's Anti-Malware section.

Apple could be just days away from becoming the subject of an unpleasant antitrust inquiry into a recent decision to restrict software development on the iPhone and iPad. Nevermind Apple’s moral policing which always ignites the heated debate among our readers, this is a much more serious issue than app rejections, the one with potentially far-reaching implications for the Californian firm.From Apple’s perspective, they are entitled to define user experience on the iPhone platform which is – mind you – neither open-sourced nor open in the Android sense. Apple’s unmatched ability to create gadgets that “just work” stems from their tight control of the entire widget, including software, hardware, apps, services, and user interfaces. Take this control away from Apple and you have just another gadget vendor that builds dull products.The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is thinking different about such a closed ecosystem. According to New York Post, Apple could be “in the eye of regulatory storm” and might even face an antitrust probe over its lock out on iPad and iPhone. A source “familiar with the matter” told the publication that:The inquiry could pave the way for a fully-fledged investigation if the agencies conclude that Apple’s controversial decision to prohibit app development does in fact stifle competition. According to Steve Jobs’ widely publicized rambling titled “Thoughts on Flash,” Apple sees third party cross-development tools as a big no-no because they lead to “sub-standard apps and hinder the enhancement and progress” of the platform. It’s a fight for developers’ resources because programmers must choose between “developing an Apple-exclusive app over one that can be used on Apple and rival devices simultaneously,” New York Post noted.Developers with limited budgets are hurt the most because their focus on iPhone inevitably comes at the expense of other platforms. Jobs has a point, too, because cross-development tools do enable only the lowest common denominator set of features, as he summed it up nicely:If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers. This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor’s platforms.Apple’s our-way-or-the-highway approach makes sense from their way of doing things.  By the way, Adobe’s shares dipped two percent the day Apple published that piece. We’ll find out soon if the DoJ and FTC can establish the case against Apple, but we can help but wonder who’s next?Probe Microsoft because Windows doesn’t run Linux apps? Go after Sony because it only sells Sony Pictures movies on Playstation Network? Bring movie studios to justice because we aren’t allowed to watch FairPlay-DRM’d iTunes movies on non-Apple devices? Hit Adobe because its Flash is killing the prospect of open videos? Meet us in comments.Read more at New York Post

A new lawsuit alleges AT&T is regularly overcharging iPhone and iPad customers for data usage, in some cases up to 300% more.[ad#Google Adsense 300x250 in story]Lawyers for the lawsuit said they spent $80,000 testing devices in preparation for their day in court. In one instance, lawyers purchased a brand new iPhone and turned off everything that could affect data usage. When the bill came in from AT&T, there were 35 transactions for data usage, according to MSNBC.Lawyers said that AT&T overcharged on every single transaction. Not once did a data usage charge go in favor of the customer. Lawyers said that AT&T systematically overstated data usage by 7-14% and sometimes up to 300%.While they said that individual charges may add up to $10 or $15 a month, with millions of customers, it’s quite a boon for AT&T.One lawyer compared the AT&T charges to a rigged gas pump where you pay for a gallon of gas and only get 9/10 of a gallon.AT&T says the charges are “without merit” and says customers misunderstand how data is charged. The company points to things like automatic app updates in the background that customers may not be aware of.

Apple on Monday rested its case that Samsung ripped off the design of the iPhone and iPad while building its own mobile products. Meanwhile, three of the Samsung phones that Apple labeled as infringing were tossed from the trial.It was a minor victory for Samsung. The Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S i9000, and Galaxy S II i9100 were thrown out of the case by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh after questions about whether the phones were even sold in the US. The devices were dropped from the case because they are “world phones that could be purchased in the US., but that weren't sold by Samsung's telecommunications and electronics divisions in the US,” according to CNET.All Things D points out, however, that the ruling does not affect the US-specific versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S and Galaxy SII phones, which are among roughly 20 devices Apple has identified as infringing its intellectual property. Moreover, the three phones were essentially worthless in Apple's case from a financial perspective. Apple's damages report assigned the three phones a worth of $0, the only phones in the case with such a distinction.Samsung tried to get a larger victory today, asking for a Judgment as a Matter of Law that Apple hasn’t proven its case, and that no reasonable jury could possibly side with Apple. Koh rejected Samsung’s request, meaning the case will, as expected, move forward to the next phase. Earlier on Monday, Apple’s expert witness on financial matters testified regarding the damages Apple is seeking, a number that recently grew from $2.5 billion to $2.88 billion.With Apple resting its case, Samsung was able to start its defense late this afternoon. Samsung's first witness was Benjamin Bederson, chief scientist and co-founder of a mobile company called Zumobi. Bederson is testifying on Samsung's behalf because he helped create a user interface for mobile touchscreen devices called LaunchTile, which was apparently used in conjunction with Microsoft's Pocket PC software and the HP iPAQ device starting in November 2004. Samsung believes LaunchTile should count as prior art, making some of Apple's patents invalid because the technology already existed, according to a Forbes liveblog of the trial. After Bederson, one of the people behind a 2001 touchscreen tabletop computer called DiamondTouch also testified on the prior art issue.We’ll hear much more about why Samsung doesn't think it infringed Apple’s patents as the week goes on. Judge Koh is reportedly aiming to move to closing arguments by Tuesday of next week before handing the case off to the jury.

SAN JOSE -- Apple released late Tuesday its best evidence that Samsung has copied its patents and trade dress, a 132-page Samsung report comparing its handsets to the iPhone.The report methodically compares the iPhone and Samsung's S1 handset across 126 specific features. A page is dedicated to each feature with each page showing side-by-side comparisons of how the iPhone and the S1 implement the feature.At the bottom of each page, the report makes recommendations for how Samsung could improve its handsets. The direction generally is to more closely adopt Apple's practices.Apple sees this document from a product engineering team in Samsung's software verification group as its smoking gun. Samsung counters the document is merely observing and benchmarking best practices in the industry as one aspect of competition.We'll let you decide by looking at some examples of the document below. We invite your comments. Is this evidence of illegal copying or normal industry benchmarking?Let's start with the cover:

In the late '70s, when I was just out of college, and even before I began my career as a journalist, I worked in public relations at Hewlett-Packard Co.These were the final years of HP as "the world's greatest company" under its two founders. ... And being in such comfortable and friendly surroundings and working for such an enlightened employer basically spoiled me for any other job thereafter.Indeed, there were only two problems with that job:1. I didn't want to be a PR man;As it happened, the two were closely related. Simon was a great big, linebacker-sized guy who was both whip-smart and tough. He was a few years older than me and was working for a weekly industry newsprint tabloid called Electronic News. EN was notorious for underpaying its reporters (which was why they were usually young and destined to quickly move on) and for having neither the time nor inclination to do much more editorially than rewrite corporate press releases.That is, until Mark Simon came along.He was as young and transient as the rest of EN's reporters; but he was also clever and fearless. Suddenly, under his byline, stories started appearing the likes of which the electronics trade press, notoriously deferential to the giant companies of the tech world, had never seen. Simon broke insider stories, published internal strategy memos and pre-introduced secret projects, all with seeming abandon ... leaving corporate PR departments, like us at HP, scrambling to do damage control and plug the leaks.As the kid in HP corporate PR department, I both feared Simon for the damage he could do with his breaking stories -- my turf was hugely successful calculator business -- and was in awe of his reporting skills. I also wasn't allowed to talk much with him when he came into our offices for fear I would slip up and accidentally give my counterpart another news hook.It wasn't until years later, when I was a reporter myself (and talked with Mark) that I came to realize that all Simon was doing was just good hard reporting. His techniques ranged from learning to read upside down the memos on executives' desks while conducting interviews, cold calling low-level employees who didn't know better than to talk with the press, pretending to know information to get official confirmation, and the whole rest of the toolkit of good investigative reporting.Mark also told me that the biggest source for his insider information was, in fact, the rising golden boy executive at HP, who got a kick out of making controlled leaks to manipulate the press and his counterparts at the company.Mark went on to become a distinguished political reporter in Sacramento for the San Francisco Chronicle. And, having seen him in action, I redoubled my efforts to become a newspaperman myself -- which I accomplished a couple years later. And in those first years in the newsroom, I tried to pattern myself on what I had seen of Simon in action. He was my gold standard.That was a long time ago. But what's important today about that story is that no matter how furious HP was at Mark Simon's ability to pre-announce its products and expose internal company documents, it never once crossed anyone's mind to call the cops on him.

Although previous versions of Windows Mobile have long supported a clipboard to move content around, the Windows Phone 7 Series devices due out this year won't have that ability.LAS VEGAS--The new Windows Phones have a lot of things that prior versions of Windows Mobile haven't had, most notably a cool factor.But one thing that the 7 Series devices won't have--at least not this year's crop--is the ability to broadly copy and paste items. As earlier noted by Engadget, Microsoft confirmed on Tuesday that developers shouldn't expect to have access to a clipboard to allow users to copy and paste. Nor will Microsoft's own Office applications have copy and paste. That's despite the fact that it has been a staple of past versions of Windows Mobile for as long as I can recall."We don't enable copy and paste and we do that very intentionally," Windows Phone executive Todd Brix said in an interview.Brix said many times when a user copies something on a phone, what they really are looking to do is take a specific action, such as calling a phone number or e-mailing an address. For those specific tasks, Microsoft has what it calls "smart linking," which lets a user double click on a phone number and either call it or add it to the phone book. For an address, one can get a map without having to copy and paste the address."It's actually an intentional design decision," he said. "We try to anticipate what the user wants so copy and paste isn't necessary."But, particularly for a device that is going to include Word and other mobile Office applications, the concept of intelligent links doesn't seem sufficient. The BlackBerry for example, offers both intelligent links and a copy-and-paste system, which seems to me to be ideal.Brix insists that most users won't miss copy and paste and said that it was a matter of focus; Microsoft said it wanted to really do well the tasks that 80 percent of users wanted."We tried to focus on what the core use cases were," Brix said. "Certainly there will be some people that wont be happy with some of those decisions."If this feels like deja vu, a similar limitation hampered the initial iPhone, with Apple later going back and adding the feature.As my colleague Jessica Dolcourt noted recently, it's not like users don't want copy and paste. We just take it for granted unless some one boldy chooses to omit it.With the 7 Series taking so many cues from the iPhone, I'm surprised Microsoft didn't learn that lesson.

Cybersecurity researcher Charlie Miller and his fellow researcher Collin Mulliner plan to present research on a huge iPhone security hole Thursday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. Not an iPhone virus, but rather an SMS hack, the issue can allow a hacker complete control over an iPhone.According to the researchers, they will demonstrate how to send a series of mostly invisible SMS "bursts" that can give a hacker complete control of the iPhone. That control will include dialing the phone, visiting Web sites, turning on the device's camera and microphone, and more. The hacker will also be able to send more text messages to facilitate spreading the iPhone SMS hack to other iPhones.To an end user, the evidence that someone is trying to use the iPhone's SMS hack on your device will be a text message on your iPhone containing only a single square character. The only way to avoid being hacked would be to quickly turn off the device. In terms of the amount of control, this hack sounds, quite honestly, very similar to how certain Trojans can turn a PC into a bot, and similarly control it remotely."This is serious. The only thing you can do to prevent it is turn off your phone. Someone could pretty quickly take over every iPhone in the world with this."That's a bit of hyperbole, as first a hacker would have to know the appropriate phone numbers to use to hack an iPhone (and there are plenty of phone numbers assigned to other devices). It is obviously very serious, and despite the researchers sharing their results with Apple over a month ago, there has been no movement on a fix as of yet.Interestingly, the researchers also found a similar "remote control" texting bug in Windows Mobile, and other bugs in Android and the iPhone that can let hackers boot the phones off the network. The Android bug has been closed, but the second iPhone bug has not.Miller and Mulliner also found a hole in the iPhone's Safari browser way back in 2007 when it was first launched.Comment and add to the story without registration, but keep the comments meaningful please.

Citigroup Inc. said its free U.S. mobile-banking application for Apple Inc.'s iPhone contained a security flaw and advised its customers to upgrade to a newer version that corrects the problem.In an incident that highlights the growing security challenges around wireless apps, Citi said its iPhone app accidentally saved information—including account numbers, bill payments and security access codes—in a hidden file on users' iPhones. The information may also have been saved to a user's computer if it had been synched with an iPhone.The issue affected the approximately 117,600 customers who had registered the iPhone app with Citi since its launch in March 2009, a person familiar with the matter said. The bank doesn't believe any personal data was exposed by the flaw."We have no reason to believe that our customers' personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately by anyone," Citi said. Apple acknowledged the issue and encouraged users to download the updated app.Mobile banking is a popular and fast-growing activity on smartphones, as cellphones become more sophisticated and consumers use them to organize their lives. The Citi Mobile app, currently the 11th most-popular offering in the finance category of Apple's App Store, allows customers to check balances, transfer funds and pay bills.An estimated 18 million adults, or 7% of the adult population, are "active users" of mobile banking, meaning they use it at least once every three months—a small but growing fraction of the 196 million adults, or 84% of the population, who use any kind of banking services, said Red Gillen, a mobile- banking analyst at Celent, a financial-services research firm.Citibank, with an estimated 800,000 mobile customers, ranks No. 5 in mobile banking, Celent said, behind Bank of America Corp. at No. 1 with an estimated 5 million users. In between are J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. at No. 2 with 2 million, United Services Automobile Association at No. 3 with 1.5 million, and Wells Fargo & Co. with 1.4 million, according to Celent estimates.Experts worry that security isn't keeping up with the app boom. Among their concerns is the prospect of "leakage" any time a wireless app logs confidential data. The risk of flaws like Citi's, says John Hering, CEO of mobile security provider Lookout, is that a hacker could devise a malicious app to retrieve sensitive information stored on an iPhone.Citi said its mobile-banking app is the only application authorized to access the hidden data. The upgraded application, released July 19, doesn't store the information and deletes any account data that may have been saved to a user's iPhone or computer.Citi said the problem was discovered in a routine security review. The bank told customers of the problem in a letter dated July 20. Other Citi mobile apps such as the app for credit-card customers weren't affected, Citi said in a statement.Citi developed the application with mobile financial-services provider mFoundry . Drew Sievers, CEO of mFoundry, a private company based in Larkspur, Calif., said his company custom-wrote the mobile-banking part of the application and handed it over to Citibank, which then combined it with custom code of its own.Citi is responsible for distributing and managing the app, Mr. Sievers said. MFoundry, which provides mobile-banking software to 150 banks and credit unions besides Citi, said none of its other customers were affected by the problem.Citi said it performed security tests before and after releasing the application, but failed to detect the problem. The bank said it is looking into why it didn't find the vulnerability earlier.Mr. Hering, the CEO of Lookout, said his company is discovering more apps that could inadvertently expose or leak personal data, such as location information and phone numbers. "Most consumers and app developers don't know what is happening in their apps, because it is moving so fast," Mr. Hering said. "Apps are proliferating so quickly. We will see more and more of this."

An interesting NYT Bits blog entry covers Opera's mobile browser . Buried in the middle of the article is this quote: "Opera's engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone, but Apple won't let the company release it because it competes with Apple's own Safari browser." It also talks about Opera on the Wii and browsers in cars. A good read. : But back to the iPhone. As tempted as I am to just shrug it off, since Apple is free to run its App Store any way it pleases, as an enthusiastic iPhone user, I think Apple is shooting itself in the foot here, as it is with all the "competitive" apps being rejected. Apple does stand to lose some Google revenue by letting people use other browsers, but they have much more to gain by unleashing the creativity of the developer community and giving them the freedom to improve or replace core iPhone functionality. Hopefully competition from Android forces them to wake up.

Ever wanted to unlock your iPhone simply by having it look at you and recognize who you are? A jailbreak mod called RecognizeMe will be hitting Cydia soon and promises to bring biometric facial recognition security to the iPhone 4. The mod will allow you to unlock your iPhone by scanning your facial features with the front-facing camera and verifying who you are before giving you access.The tweak offers settings for dialing up the level of security (facial matching), which we're assuming requires a bit more processing time, but the app definitely appears to deliver on its promise of facial recognition security for the iPhone 4. The mod looks a little slow at the moment, but hopefully the developers are able to optimize the code before an official release.Check out the video after the jump, and let us know what you think in the comments!

Apple is planning to launch a new version of the iPhone which will work almost anywhere in the world, according to American technology experts.The "worldwide" version of the iPhone will be sold first in the US market next summer by Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone has a 45% stake, according to Ashok Kumar, analyst at Northeast Securities.The new phone will use a microchip developed by Qualcomm that can use both the 3G networks which predominate in Europe and Africa as well as the CDMA2000 network used by Verizon in the US and other networks across the world."This Qualcomm-powered world phone will facilitate Apple to be carrier-agnostic," Kumar said, meaning it would be able to further expand its list of mobile network partners.Kumar's prediction follows a recent report by industry analysts OTR Global which quoted sources in the Taiwan handset supply chain as saying they had been contracted to supply a "hybrid" iPhone by the third quarter of 2010.When Apple initially launched the iPhone in 2007 it did so under exclusive deals with network partners in the US, UK, France and Germany. Since then, however, it has abandoned this strategy in order to sell iPhones through many more mobile phone networks across the world.Earlier this week, Orange started selling the iPhone in the UK, ending O2's two-year long exclusive deal. Orange reckons that it had sold over 30,000 by 4pm on the first day of sales, while Carphone Warehouse believes it will sell a 1m iPhones by Christmas.The success of the iPhone has made Apple the world's most profitable smartphone manufacturer, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, overtaking the world's largest handset producer, Nokia.The research firm has examined the smartphone market for the three months to the end of September – in which 43m phones that can access the web, send emails and download applications were sold – and reckons that Apple surpassed Nokia for the first time ever."We estimate Apple's operating profit for its iPhone handset division stood at $1.6bn in the third quarter of 2009," said Alex Spektor, analyst at Strategy Analytics. "Apple overtook Nokia for the first time, which recorded a lower $1.1bn of operating profit. With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost controls, the PC vendor has successfully broken into the mobile phone market in just two years."Nokia has struggled to produce a lucrative rival to the iPhone. The Apple device has also spawned a host of touchscreen devices from other handset manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and Motorola, all of which have eaten into Nokia's share of a smartphone market it once dominated. Last month, Nokia announced its first quarterly loss for more than a decade.The slew of touchscreen phones that have hit the shops have helped the smartphone market outperform the rest of the mobile phone industry, where sales have been in decline. But Nokia does not seem able to capitalise on the fact that consumers want high-end devices and its share of the smartphone market is slipping.Last month, Nokia said it reckoned the entire mobile phone industry shipped 288m units in the quarter, down 7% on the same period a year ago, but up 7% on the second quarter. Nokia, however, shipped 108.5m units in the third quarter, which is down 8% on the same period last year and only up 5% on the previous quarter.Nokia stripped out smartphone sales from the overall figures, estimating that 47m "converged mobile devices" were shipped in the three months, compared with an estimated 44.2m units in the third quarter of 2008 and 41m units in the second quarter of 2009. Of that total figure, Nokia sold 16.4m units in the third quarter of 2009; that is down from 16.9m in the second quarter of 2009 but admittedly a better performance than the 15.5m it shipped in the third quarter of the previous year.Just a week after the results were announced, Nokia took the dramatic step of launching a legal attack on Apple in the US courts, alleging the iPhone infringes 10 of its patents in a dispute that could drag on for years.

XBMC is a free media player that began life on the Xbox but has since grown to be a multi-platform solution. The XBMC software, which already runs on the previous Mac OS X-based, Intel x86 Apple TV, has now been released to work on the ARM Architecture A4 chip used in the new iOS version, offering the ability to install apps and play content formats Apple doesn't natively support on its $99 box, according to AppleInsider. Furthermore it will be able to be played on the iPad and iPhone.With regard to jailbreaking and Apple TV, MacRumors.com says:The software is not available through the App Store, and requires a jailbroken Apple TV or iOS device. While jailbreaking has been a known way to load third party apps onto the iPad and iPhone, it's not been a very common procedure for the Apple TV. Due to similarities of the underlying iOS firmware on the new Apple TV, it's been widely expected that these unauthorized apps would become available for the device. Apple presently offers no authorized way to install apps on the Apple TV.

Google launched its first-ever Gmail app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch on Wednesday, but was forced to yank it from Apple's App Store within minutes due to a bug, Computerworld reported."Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS. Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app," Matthew Izatt, a Google product manager, wrote on the company's Gmail blog. "We’ve removed the app while we correct the problem, and we’re working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who’s already installed the app can continue to use it."According to Computerworld, "scores" of users who downloaded the app were complaining on Twitter that they received a "Notification Error" message upon launching the app. "Googla culpa!" David Girouard, Google's vice president of apps, Tweeted on Wednesday, according to Computerworld. "Sorry, but we pushed a bad version of our iOS app for Gmail. More info shortly - we're working on it."Before the app was yanked, Izatt had written a blog post touting the new app and saying it was "fast, efficient and take[s] full advantage of the touchscreen and notification capabilities of your device."Meanwhile, Google has also been rolling out a new look for its regular Gmail service. On Tuesday, the company wrote a blog post giving an "in-depth" look at the new design, along with a video:On Wednesday, as people got a chance to experience the changes from themselves, many have, perhaps predictably, shared their feelings on Twitter. Here's a sample of what people are saying:[View the story "New Gmail" on Storify]What do you think?

Nokia's Lumia 920 packs the industry's best image stabilization -- there's no questioning that -- thanks to a camera module that pairs both sensor and lens-based optical IS. The iPhone 5 also offers a notable improvement over its Apple-made predecessor on the video front, but considering that its stabilization is of the digital variety, we wouldn't expect it to top Nokia's new flagship. We had an opportunity to test both smartphones in a head-to-head demo at Nokia's research and development facility in Tampere, Finland, about two hours north of the company's Espoo headquarters. In fact, we're told that this is the very first such comparison shoot in the world, considering that the iPhone made it to market just last week and the only opportunity to shoot with a Lumia 920 is currently in the European country where the device was born.As expected, the Nokia phone was able to capture far smoother video than what we snapped with the iPhone, with both devices secured side-by-side in a homemade foam holster. Unlike our handheld interview shoot earlier today, we pushed the limits a bit further this time, running through Nokia's parking lot and turning every which way as well. It's important to note that the Lumia 920 we used was a prototype, but its performance was still quite solid. You'll find the side-by-side video just past the break -- the Lumia 920 is on the left, with the iPhone clip on the right.Update: We also had an opportunity to test the Samsung Galaxy S III (just below) and the HTC One X (following) against the Lumia 920. Both smartphones lack OIS, so we weren't surprised to see poor stabilization performance. Check out the videos for the head-to-head.

It’s supposed to be your "life in your pocket," not Apple’s. But a piece of code discovered in the iPhone operating system might keep you under Apple’s control.Jonathan Zdrianski, author of the book iPhone Open Application Development, discovered a URL hidden in iPhone’s CoreLocation that he believes the iPhone uses to check whether any apps on your phone match with those listed in a database of blacklisted applications. Presumably, that would allow Apple to remotely de-authorize those apps, or perhaps even delete them."This suggests that the iPhone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off," Zdrianski wrote. "At the moment, no apps have been blacklisted, but by all appearances, this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for, if Apple so chooses to shut it down."Hum. So then all of those who got away with NetShare before it disappeared from the App Store aren’t so safe/lucky after all.Now, if Apple were more organized with regard to what appears and disappears from the App Store, they probably wouldn’t need this emergency procedure. What’s the point of an approval process if the useless, $1,000 "I Am Rich" app is going to make it out the door, only to be yanked immediately afterward?

Carrier IQ has been dominating the headlines ever since 25-year-old security researcher Trevor Eckhart posted a paper online saying Carrier IQ was secretly gathering data about users' cell phone activity on the behalf of cell phone companies Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile. The company insists it's not malicious, but that hasn't stopped several parties from suing it for allegedly violating federal wiretap laws.Carrier IQ isn't on every phone - and you can check if it's on yours with a free app from Lookout or BitDefender - but if you have detected it and want to remove it there are a couple options: 1. The easiest is to purchase Eckhart’s own removal app from the Android Market ($0.99), called Logging TestApp Pro Key. You need to root your phone first. And beware: several reviewers have warned that even after you buy the app, you need to donate money before it works. 2. The other way is to flash your Android smartphone with a custom ROM that doesn't contain Carrier IQ. The most popular is CyanogenMod, which gives you an option to opt out of data logging. "We at CyanogenMod would like everyone to know that if you are running our software, you are not running theirs," CM wrote in a blog post.Check out a video demo below from 'AbrahamsTech' of how to do this. As for iOS devices, you can really only block Carrier IQ. For those running iOS 5 and above, simply click into Settings/General/About/Diagnostics & Usage, and hit “Don’t Send.” If you're stuck on iOS 3 or 4, or have a jailbroken device, Chpwn’s instructions should do the trick. Apple told my colleague Chloe Albanesiusthat it stopped supporting Carrier IQ on most of its devices with iOS 5 and will remove it from all products in a future software update—most likely an incremental one rather than a full update like iOS 6.Although Carrier IQ says its software is intended to help its clients monitor network performance and it denies gathering any personal information from users like screen shots or the content of their text messages and emails, many people still loathe the idea of a company recording how they use their phones.For more from Sara, follow her on Twitter @sarapyin.

Free image-browsing app is intended to show what is possible on the mobile platform, but where is the Windows Mobile version?Is it possible some at Microsoft find the iPhone a more attractive platform than the software giant's own Windows Mobile?Engineers in the company's Live Labs have released the company's first application for Apple's popular smartphone--even before making it available on Microsoft's own mobile platform. Seadragon Mobile, which was added to Apple's App Store on Saturday, is a free image-browsing app that allows users to quickly "deep zoom" images while online and is intended to demonstrate what is possible with a mobile platform.Seadragon is the backbone for Microsoft's Photosynth, which allows users to take a grouping of photographs and stitch them together into a faux 3D environment.Other iPhone apps are reportedly in development in Redmond; Microsoft's Tellme unit was expected to release the company's first iPhone app in the form of a voice-activated search for a variety of phones, including iPhone and BlackBerry. A Microsoft representative told my colleague Ina Fried in September that a public version of that program would likely be released in a few months.So where's the Windows Mobile version of Seadragon?"The iPhone is the most widely distributed phone with a (graphics processing unit)," Alex Daley, group product manager for Microsoft Live Labs, told TechFlash. "Most phones out today don't have accelerated graphics in them. The iPhone does and so it enabled us to do something that has been previously difficult to do."

Many iPhone users arrived at work an hour late this morning after a glitch caused their smartphone's alarm to malfunction.In the latest clock woe to strike the Apple device, some phones rang their alert an hour late, while others were an hour early and many didn't ring at all.Users who missed appointments took to Twitter and other blogging sites to vent their frustration.One person who had an unexpected lie-in Tweeted: 'It was set for 8 but went off at 7 I then set it for 9 and it went off at 9'.The glitch is thought to have been caused by the change to British Summer Time in the early hours of Sunday morning.But for all of its fancy features, the iPhone has had trouble telling the time of late, particularly when the clocks go back or forward an hour.A clock malfunction prevented alarms from sounding for the first three days of the New Year, leading to complaints from users that they had missed flights or were late to arrive at work.The devices also struggled to adjust to the end of U.S. daylight savings time in November.One possible solution is to shut down and restart the phone or switch it to 'airplane mode' and then back again - advice that is too little, too late for those who slept in.Apple was embroiled in publicity problems in July last year after the launch of the iPhone 4, when reports about bad reception snowballed and forced the company to call a news conference to address the issue, dubbed 'antennagate'.This had no visible impact on Apple's sales as the company sold more than 14million iPhones in the quarter ending last September, more than ever before.Apple reached another milestone earlier this month when it sold between 500,000 and a million iPad 2 tablet computers in the U.S. alone.People across America queued for hours to become one of the first to buy the must-have gadget.The pattern was repeated in the UK on Friday when the iPad 2 went on sale here. It was sold out by lunchtime on Saturday.

HTC has filed a law suit against Apple seeking a ban on imports of Asian-manufactured iPhones, iPods and iPads into the United States.The HTC caction alleges that Apple products infringed five HTC patents and seeks to have them barred from sale in the United States from their manufacturing facilities in Asia. Apple declined to comment."We are taking this action against Apple to protect our intellectual property, our industry partners, and most importantly our customers that use HTC phones," HTC vice president for North America Jason Mackenzie said."HTC believes the industry should be driven by healthy competition and innovation that offer consumers the best, most accessible mobile experiences possible," Mackenzie said in a statement.HTC, which stands for High Tech Computer, is Taiwan's leading smartphone maker. It is already the target of a patent suit by Apple filed in March alleging infringement of 20 iPhone patents including "user interface, underlying architecture and hardware". Apple too wants a ban on sales of HTC devices in the dispute.HTC makes handsets for a number of leading US companies and is the manufacturer of the Nexus One unveiled by Apple rival Google in January. It also makes other Android-based phones, including the Desire, sold in Australia, which some believe is a potential iPhone killer.While Apple's lawsuit against HTC did not name Google as a defendant, it was seen as a strategic move against Google, whose free mobile software also powers handsets from Samsung Electronics, Motorola and others.HTC's complaints re unlikely to block sales of Apple products any time soon. Patent disputes are common among technology companies and often take years to resolve. The cases often lead to licensing agreements rather than outright bans on imports.The wild success of the first iPhone, which launched in 2007, prompted other mobile phone phone makers to rush out touch-screen smart phones of their own in a bid to lure consumers, not just business users attached to their BlackBerry phones.At the end of 2009, iPhones made up about 14 per cent of smart phones sold worldwide, according to the research group Gartner. Apple inched closer to BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, which had 20 per cent of sales. But Android phones, while accounting for only four per cent of sales, grew at a faster rate than Apple last year.Apple is also being sued by Nokia for patent infringement. It has fired a countersuit against the Finnish mobile phone giant.Canada's Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, has also had its share of patent woes and was accused of patent infringement by US mobile phone maker Motorola in a suit filed in January.

Alright folks, this is the single biggest news in iPhone hacking ever since the jailbreak. iPhone hacker and Dev-Team member Planetbeing apparently just managed to port Google’s Android Mobile OS to the iPhone.I repeat, he took the Android OS, the system that runs on the Android phones, and installed it on an iPhone. I believe this is the very first time someone managed to install a non-Apple OS on the iPhone and the implications of this are absolutely huge.It’s still in alpha version for now, but with some improvements, this would allow anybody to use both iPhone and Android OS on their iPhone. Just like you can do Bootcamp on your Mac to access PC apps, you’ll be able to go on Android to try all these apps that don’t exist, or were not allowed on the iPhone. Imagine for a second that Adobe manages to puts flash on there, well, you’ll get to have it too.Check it out, it’s just sick:To get more late breaking news as it happens, download the AppAdvice iPhone/iPad app!

A US hacker who gained notoriety for unlocking Apple's iPhone as a teenager has told BBC News that he has now hacked Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3). George Hotz said the hack, which could allow people to run pirated games or homemade software, took him five weeks. He said he was still refining the technique but intended to post full details online soon. The PS3 is the only games console that has not been hacked, despite being on the market for three years. "It's supposed to be unhackable - but nothing is unhackable," Mr Hotz told BBC News. "I can now do whatever I want with the system. It's like I've got an awesome new power - I'm just not sure how to wield it." Sony said it was "investigating the report" and would "clarify the situation" when it had more information. Mr Hotz said that he had begun the hack last summer when he had spent three weeks analysing the hardware. After a long break, he spent a further two weeks cracking the console, which he described as a "very secure system". He said that he was not yet ready to reveal the full details of the hack but said that it was "5% hardware and 95% software". The hack could allow gamers to play pirated games "You can use hardware to inject an insecurity and then you can build on that," he said. He admitted that he had not managed to hack the whole system, including the protected memory, but had worked out ways to trick the console into doing what he wanted. Mr Hotz said that he was continuing to work on the hack and, once finished, would publish details online in a similar way to his previous iPhone exploits. In particular, he said, he would publish details of the console's "root key", a master code that once known would make it easier for others to decipher and hack other security features on the console. He said his motivation was "curiosity" and "opening up the platform". "To tell you the truth, I've never really played a PS3," he said. "I have one game, but I've never really played it." Opening the system could allow people to install other operating systems on their console and play homemade games, he said. In addition, he said, the hack would allow people to play older PS2 games on their consoles. Recent versions of the PS3 do not have the ability to play PS2 games after Sony controversially removed a piece of hardware. He admitted that it could also allow people to run pirated games. "I'm not going to personally have anything to do with that," he told BBC News. Gaming firms do not take the issue of game piracy and console modification lightly. Recently, Microsoft disconnected thousands of gamers from its online gaming service Xbox Live for modifying their consoles to play pirated games. Mr Hotz said that the nature of his PS3 hack means that Sony may have difficulty patching the exploit. "We are investigating the report and will clarify the situation once we have more information," said a Sony spokesman. Mr Hotz rose to fame in 2007 at the age of 17 when he unlocked the iPhone, which could only be used on the AT&T network in the US at launch. The hack allowed the popular handset to be used on any network. He has since released various other hacks, allowing people to unlock later versions of the popular handset.

Path has released a new version of the app which asks for permission before it sends your address book to its servers and has blogged about the episode.Dave Morin, the CEO of Path has responded in the comments and I’ve pasted it below. As an aside – never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this to blow up like this. I hope we can keep calm and continue to discuss this sensibly.Arun, thanks for pointing this out. We actually think this is an important conversation and take this very seriously. We upload the address book to our servers in order to help the user find and connect to their friends and family on Path quickly and effeciently as well as to notify them when friends and family join Path. Nothing more. We believe that this type of friend finding & matching is important to the industry and that it is important that users clearly understand it, so we proactively rolled out an opt-in for this on our Android client a few weeks ago and are rolling out the opt-in for this in 2.0.6 of our iOS Client, pending App Store approval.It all started innocently enough. I was thinking of implementing a Path Mac OS X app as part of our regularly scheduled hackathon. Using the awesome mitmproxy tool which was featured on the front page of Hacker News yesterday, I started to observe the various API calls made to Path’s servers from the iPhone app. It all seemed harmless enough until I observed a request to .Upon inspecting closer, I noticed that my entire address book (including full names, emails and phone numbers) was being sent as a plist to Path. Now I don’t remember having given permission to Path to access my address book and send its contents to its servers, so I created a completely new “Path” and repeated the experiment and I got the same result – my address book was in Path’s hands.Disclaimer: I’m not insinuating that Path is doing something nefarious with my address book but I feel quite violated that my address book is being held remotely on a third-party service. I love Path as an iOS app and I think there are some brilliant people working on it, but this seems a little creepy. I wonder how many other iOS apps actually do the same…As soon as you create a new account to Path, a call is made to with your first name, last name, gender and password. An plist is returned which contains the user’s ID as well as other information such as the date of creation.This API call uses basic HTTP authentication (with a certain key) to obtain some metadata about myself – from the binary plist file it looks like it contains my first name, last name, cover photo, profile picture, etc.This is the actual offending call which uploads my entire address book to Path.This is followed by normal API calls which among others, updates my location, fetches my activity stream and tracks events within the app using Mixpanel.This has been tried out on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.

Porissa sattui maanantaina aamulla jotain varsin kummallista matkapuhelimen kanssa. Nuori mies sai epämukavan kuuman herätyksen maanantaihin. - Aamusta heräilin ja piti mennä yhdeksäksi töihin, mutta meninkin kahdeksaksi isäni kyydillä, aloittaa Helminen. Perillä työpaikan pihalla nuori mies laittoi autossa iPhonen takataskuunsa ja nousi autosta ulos maanantaisesta aamuherätyksestä vielä hieman väsyneenä. Pian kuitenkin takataskussa alkoi tapahtua kummia. - Kävelin autosta ulos kaksi metriä, kun alkoi kuulua outoa suhinaa. Kohta paikat kuumenivat. - Ihmettelin sitä suhinaa ja yhtäkkiä rupesi polttamaan. Katsoin taaksepäin ja savua tuli aivan järkyttävästi. En yhtään osannut ajatella, että se olisi puhelin! Lopulta nuori mies nappaa kännykän takataskusta ja heittää maahan. - Puhelin oli ihan liekeissä ja savusi oikein kunnolla. Housutkin olivat vähän liekeissä. Kyllä siinä kädet tärisivät! Pian isä Juho Helminenkin huomasi, että jotain kummaa tapahtui. Koko tapahtumaketjun tallensi firman valvontakamera. - Siinä se ihan selkeästi näkyy, että poika kävelee autosta vähän maanantaiaamun tyyliin, ja yhtäkkiä savua tulee aivan kamalasti, isä sanoo. - Housuihin paloi kiinni sulaa muovia ja kännykkä paloi huonoon kuntoon, poika kertoo. - Jos olisin mennyt yhdeksäksi, kuten aluksi pitikin, niin kännykkähän olisi syttynyt kotona. Siinä olisi sänky syttynyt palamaan ja olisi voinut käydä pahemminkin. Pidän puhelinta aina sängyssä ja olen tässä miettinyt, mitä kaikkea olisi voinut tapahtua. Isä on ollut yhteydessä Appleen. - Ensin yhdistettiin Yhdysvaltoihin, sitten Ruotsiin ja sitten jollekin suomea puhuvalle, katsotaan nyt miten tämä tästä. Nuori on nyt ilman puhelinta ja uusi pitäisi hankkia. iPhone ei ole joutunut mustalle listalle. - Tässä on nyt selvittelyä, että mitä Apple ja vakuutus tähän sanoo. Eiköjän tässä nyt kuitenkin ole jonkinlaisesta yksittäistapauksesta kyse, poika sanoo. iPhone on ostettu maaliskuun 22. päivä ja se toimi ennen tätä moitteettomasti.

For many iPhone 4 and 4S owners, iOS 6 has been a mixed blessing. The features are terrific, but many users are reporting huge amounts of battery drainage that never was the case before the system upgrade.As an iPhone 4S owner, I can tell you from first hand knowledge that my iPhone loses about ten percent of its charge per hour without doing anything but sitting in my pocket. I noticed that with the lock screen set to two minutes, and the screen turned off, the iPhone feels quite warm, as if it's doing something.Many have blamed this on the Maps app, but I haven't even run the Maps app, so for me, that isn't the problem.An Apple Discussion board thread has more than 200 entries discussing this problem and some solutions that may provide a fix in rare cases, but it is no panacea for the great majority of users.Here are a few comments from the Apple Support Boards:Only1jb: "Used my 4S the same as every other work day. Usually come home with about 60 percent. Came home today with 17 percent."John Smith 1882: "100 percent at 8am this morning when I took it off the charger. 0 percent within four hours. No calls. No GPS, no Internet use, but battery was dropping one percent every few minutes. I turned off location services, no change."LocalBus: "Thinking of switching back to 5.1.1 now!! 9am to 10:30am the battery drain is 100 percent to 52 percent!!!!! Something is very wrong."There are scores of other  complaints.Suggestions have been offered, such as turning off location services, Maps, Passbook etc. Nothing seems to work for more than one person.The problem is not limited to those on the Support Discussion. This problem is not just being reported on the Support Site. On MacRumors forums, a user with the handle of DArsenault reported that "Battery life on the 4 is terrible. Since I've upgraded my phone drains rapidly when it's not even in use. My phone dropped from 63 percent to 30 percent in about an hour of just sitting on my desk unused."Others have reported no excessive battery drain, but enough have to make this a salient issue that needs to be addressed and quickly. I've gotten used to carrying my two battery back-up cases to just get through the day.We'll keep you posted as more information becomes available, but it seems like a software fix is in order.

The new iPhone 3G and the iPhone 2.0 software update can best be described as the most successful failure I can remember. Apple has sold an astounding number of phones and applications, and yet is failing in so many different ways:And yet, Apple can chalk this release up as yet another major success. I love my iPhone and other Apple products, but so far my expectations are not being met with the iPhone 2.0 software and the 3G iPhone experience. I fully understand why existing iPhone users are not as excited as new buyers.

After initially denying that the San Francisco Police Department was involved in searching the house of a man suspected of possessing a lost iPhone 5 prototype, a spokesman for the department has confirmed that plainclothes officers visited, but did not enter, the residence with Apple security officials.The back-and-forth saga over an iPhone 5 prototype that was reportedly lost in a bar in July took on new twists after the San Francisco Police Department first denied, then confirmed, its involvement in the search for the device. SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfeld told SF Weekly on Friday that "three or four" officers accompanied two Apple security officials to a home in the Bernal Heights neighborhood of the city. Though a separate spokesperson had originally been unable to find a record of the investigation, Dangerfeld confirmed the visit to 22-year-old Sergio Calderón's house after speaking with Apple and the captain of the Ingleside police station. The police officers "did not go inside the house," instead standing outside while Apple's employees searched Calderón's house, car and computer. "Apple came to us saying that they were looking for a lost item, and some plainclothes officers responded out to the house with them," Dangerfield said. "My understanding is that they stood outside...They just assisted Apple to the address." For his part, Calderón claims that he was led to believe that all of the visitors were police officers, as none of them identified themselves as working for Apple. "When they came to my house, they said they were SFPD," he said. "I thought they were SFPD. That's why I let them in." Calderón also alleged he was threatened by the police during the visit. "One of the officers is like, 'Is everyone in this house an American citizen?' They said we were all going to get into trouble," he said. But, Dangerfeld said that there did not appear to be any evidence that Apple's security team had falsely represented themselves as police officers. "I don't have any indication of that. I'm not going to go there," he said, adding that he plans to speak with Calderón about the incident. Details of the missing iPhone prototype first emerged earlier this week . Apple reportedly scrambled to recover the device once it discovered it was missing, using GPS to track the prototype from the Cava22 bar (pictured below) in the Mission to Bernal Heights. The incident contains an eery resemblance to last year's drama over an iPhone 4 prototype, which was left in a bar in Redwood City and eventually sold to a publication. Police have charged two individuals with misappropriation of lost property and possession of stolen property. However, Gawker Media, which reportedly paid $5000 to obtain the device, will not face charges.

Samsung (005930) isn’t even waiting for Apple (AAPL) to launch the iPhone 5 before taking aim at the new smartphone in a new run of attack ads. The first such advertisement appeared in newspapers on Sunday, comparing a sampling of iPhone 5 specs to a significantly larger list of Galaxy S III features. Under the heading “It doesn’t take a genius,” Samsung’s aim is to communicate that its flagship Android smartphone outclasses the iPhone 5 in a number of key areas including display size and quality, RAM, available storage and battery life. Apple’s iPhone 5 launches this coming Friday at 8:00 a.m. local time and the Samsung Galaxy S III went on sale in the U.S. in early July. Samsung’s full ad can be seen below.

Well, well, would you looky here? Seems like that super-exclusive iPhone leak that Gizmodo and Engadget were involved in has repeated itself in Vietnam.Engadget reported earlier this morning about the leak, and noticed that the phone is slightly different from the one seen during Gizgate, in that the screws on the bottom of the phone are no longer present.Aside from that, there are few other differences. The model is still pre-production — you can see little XXX placeholders on the body — so it may still change before launch, but the front-facing camera looks to be a pretty sure thing.Pro tip: the source link has some awesome commentary on the leak, courtesy of Google Translate. It also has more photos.

The launch of Apple’s latest smartphone has come and gone, sending millions of users home with the latest in mobile tech from Apple. Everything about the iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, and smaller, right down to the SIM card.For the second time since the original iPhone, Apple has opted for a smaller SIM to go in their phone. Micro-SIM cards are now the standard for many carriers, just in time for Apple to adopt the smaller nano-SIM for their devices. This means that every iPhone 5 user, even the ones that are moving from the iPhone 4S, need to move to a new SIM card and throw their old ones away. On an individual scale this is no big deal, but what does such a small change mean on a global scale?Within the first day of pre-orders, Apple had sold more than two million iPhone 5 handsets. This doesn’t include any of the hordes of people that waited outside of an Apple Store on the release day for the phone (which took that figure up to 5 million). This launch was the biggest one Apple has ever had, and the largest pre-order event any smartphone has ever had. More than five million people, most of whom already had a smartphone, now need a new SIM card.Despite the nano-SIM being much smaller than previous cards, the plastic tray that every user is given is the exact same size. This credit card sized piece of plastic has a small rectangle notched out where you punch through and pop out your nano-SIM. The previous SIM and the plastic holder for the new SIM are then tossed in the garbage.The previous SIM and the casing to the new SIM together will weigh about 5.6 grams. If you look at the five million users that managed to secure an iPhone 5 already, that is roughly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated just by forcing every user to replace their SIM card. Nearly 62,000 pounds of plastic waste generated in a single weekend, and the knowledge that if any of those users move away from the iPhone 5 to another device any time soon, that user will need to change SIM cards all over again.Apple maintains a page on their own website that describes all of the environmental practices, including the things they have done to improve their packaging and manufacturing process along the way.

Someone on AT&T's product marketing team must be trigger happy as the company once again mistakenly publishes a notice about free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users.AT&T iPhone users will not be getting free Wi-Fi access after all.For the second time in less than six months, AT&T mistakenly published a notice on its Web site indicating that Apple iPhone users would get free access to the wireless operator's more than 17,000 Wi-Fi hot spots around the country.News of free access to AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots was reported on several blogs Friday morning after it was discovered that a notice had been posted on AT&T's Web site. The notice, which was still live at 8:30 a.m. PDT but then was removed by 9:30 a.m., said:"AT&T knows Wi-Fi is hot, and free Wi-Fi even hotter, which is why we are proud to offer iPhone customers free access to the nation's largest Wi-Fi hot-spot network with more than 17,000 hot spots, including Starbucks. Now users can relax and access music, e-mail, and Web browsing services with their favorite blend in hand from the comfort of their favorite location."But Wes Warnock, an AT&T spokesman, told CNET News that the notice was published in error."We have not made any announcement regarding free Wi-Fi and iPhone," he said in an e-mail. "The Web page was posted in error and is being removed."The same thing happened in May when AT&T first launched free Wi-Fi access to its Laptop Connect customers, who subscribe to the company's 3G data service for laptops. Then, like now, a notice had been published briefly on AT&T's Web site indicating free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users. It was promptly removed. And at the time, a company representative told The New York Times that the notice had been published in error.I asked Warnock why AT&T had inadvertently published this information not once, but twice, and he had no comment. An AT&T spokesman had told me when the Laptop Connect program launched that smartphones, including the iPhone, would be added to the list of free of Wi-Fi access later in the year. But when I asked Warnock to verify this information, he again declined to comment.It's frustrating enough as it is sifting through the barrage of iPhone rumors and misinformation on the Web. But to have misinformation disseminated by AT&T's official Web site is even more disconcerting. I'd love to hear what readers have to say on this matter. I can't imagine it's winning AT&T any points among customers or potential customers in terms of customer service.

An Apple logo is seen at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California June 11, 2012.The ruling came from Judge Richard Posner in Chicago federal court. He dismissed the litigation between Apple and Motorola Mobility with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled.The ruling is a blow for Apple, which had hoped a decisive ruling against Motorola would help it gain an upper hand in the smartphone market against Android."Apple is complaining that Motorola's phones as a whole ripped off the iPhone as a whole," Posner wrote. "But Motorola's desire to sell products that compete with the iPhone is a separate harm -— and a perfectly legal one -— from any harm caused by patent infringement."Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment on the ruling. Motorola Mobility spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said the company was pleased that Posner dismissed Apple's case.Both parties have the option to appeal Posner's ruling.Motorola sued Apple in October 2010, a move that was widely seen as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent Apple lawsuit. Apple filed its own claims against Motorola the same month.Posner issued a series of pre-trial rulings that eliminated nearly all of Motorola's patent claims against Apple from the prospective trial, while maintaining more of Apple's claims against Motorola. That meant Apple had more to gain in the trial, which had been set to start last week.However, Posner canceled the trial earlier this month.Apple had sought an injunction barring the sale of Motorola products using Apple's patented technology. But in Friday's ruling, Posner wrote that neither party is entitled to an injunction.Since Motorola could design around the minor technological features covered by Apple's patents, an injunction would be an inappropriate windfall for Apple, Posner wrote.Posner also said that Apple had not clearly demonstrated that Motorola phones caused a loss of consumer goodwill significant enough for an injunction."To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture," Posner wrote.In a bright spot for the iPhone maker, Posner also ruled that Motorola could not seek an injunction based on the one patent in the case that it was still asserting against Apple.Motorola had pledged to license that patent - which covers an aspect of wireless communication - on fair and reasonable terms to other companies in exchange for having the technology adopted as an industry standard."How could it be permitted to enjoin Apple from using an invention that it contends Apple must use if it wants to make a cell phone," Posner wrote.At a hearing earlier this week, Apple had argued that it would be satisfied with an injunction forcing Motorola to remove Apple's patented features within three months. But Posner found that proposal unworkable, in part because of the hardship in administering such an order."Because of the potential costs to Motorola and the federal judiciary I could not responsibly order injunctive relief in favor of Apple," he wrote in his ruling.The case is Apple Inc. and NeXT Software Inc. V. Motorola Inc. and Motorola Mobility Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, no. 11-08540.(Reporting by Dan Levine in Oakland, California and Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Gary Hill and Jeremy Laurence)

The highly anticipated iPhone 5 may already be facing competition in China -- and it hasn't even been released to the public yet.Recently founded GooPhone unveiled its phone in late August, according to GizChina, and it looks an awful lot like the leaked images of the iPhone 5 that have been circulating around the Web.The GooPhone I5 runs on an Android platform, and may have a 3.5-inch display instead of the 4-inch display rumored to be a feature of the iPhone 5. Otherwise, the two smartphones seem pretty identical.Raw Story reports the GooPhone will include a quad-core 1.4Ghz processor, 8 mega-pixel camera, high-def screen and desktop theme mimicking the iPhone’s iconic aesthetic. The clone also features a honeybee logo on its back panel and boasts a markedly cheaper price: $300 dollars, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.If this cloned phone is the real deal, Apple may have bigger problems than a Chinese price war.According to Gizmodo, GooPhone, the smartphone business of Shenzhen Shenma Lianzhong e-Commerce, is planning on suing Apple if it tries to release its iPhone 5, citing patent violations.Plausible?Perhaps in China, writes Robin Feldman, Professor of Law at UC Hastings and author of the book "Rethinking Patent Rights."“It would be unfortunate if a country’s patent system were designed to allow this type of behavior," Feldman told Wired.“If this behavior had occurred in the United States, Apple would have an action for misappropriation of trade secrets.”In a report released Thursday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, the trade organization warns of the dangers of "trademark squatting."This not the first time GooPhone has attempted to beat mainstream manufacturers to the punch. According to Wired, the Hong-Kong based company has produced knockoffs of the Samsung Galaxy S3, the HTC ONE S and the iPhone 4. In the case of the Galaxy S3, the advertisements used by GooPhone appear to be press shots of the original product.Copied products in Asia are edging into a very lucrative market. China has recently overtaken the U.S. in overall smartphone sales, according to the latest research from the International Data Corporation. In 2012, China will account for 26.5 percent of all smartphone shipments, up from 18.3 percent in 2011 and nearly nine percentage points higher than U.S. smartphones shipments.The other major issue presented by the GooPhone I5 and its ilk are the lawsuits that will surely follow.Apple is currently embroiled in several disputes in China, over the iPad trademark, Siri technology and the Snow Leopard operating system.

Samsung is suing Apple to stop sales of the iPhone 4S in Australia, just days after the device went on sale around the world.Both companies are now shelling out millions in legal fees to fight more than 20 patent infringement cases in 10 countries. Samsung recently vowed to shift its strategy from "passive" to being "more aggressive" in targeting Apple for "free riding" on its patents.Samsung filed a suit seeking a ban on sales of the iPhone 4S in the Federal Court's New South Wales Registry today, and separately lodged an appeal against last week's decision by the court to temporarily ban sales of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia.Suits against the iPhone 4S had already been launched in Italy and France but today Samsung filed preliminary injunction motions in Tokyo and Australia. A similar case in the Netherlands was dismissed on Friday.It is unclear why Samsung did not file its suit before the device went on sale. Telstra alone has sold tens of thousands of iPhone 4 units in the opening three days - "our highest-selling iPhone launch to date" - according to Telstra's director of mobile, Andrew Volard.Senior patent lawyer Mark Summerfield, from Watermark in Melbourne, said he believed the delay in filing the suit would make it much harder for Samsung to make a case for pulling the iPhone 4S from shelves. He said Samsung may have been waiting for the Federal Court to hand down its preliminary injunction decision for the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which occurred last Thursday."I don't think the chances are very high that it will actually be pulled off the shelves," Summerfield said, adding he believed any resolution would most likely be around the payment of royalties.Independent intellectual property expert Florian Mueller said he did not believe Samsung would be successful in its bid to block the iPhone 4S as the patents it was relying on were "essential to the 3G telecommunications standard".Samsung recently surpassed Apple in global smartphone sales for the third quarter."Samsung's preliminary injunction request in Australia cites three patent infringements related to wireless telecommunications standards, specifically Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) and HSPA," Samsung said in a statement."The injunction request in Japan cites infringements on one High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) standard-related patent and three user interface patents, which seriously violate Samsung's intellectual property."In light of these violations, Samsung believes the sale of such Apple devices should be injuncted. Apple has continued to violate our patent rights and free ride on our technology. We will steadfastly protect our intellectual property."Earlier today it was revealed that despite the injunction on the Galaxy Tab 10.1, many Australians were still ordering the device from online stores.Samsung has suffered setbacks in court in recent days. In addition to the temporary ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 sales in Australia, in the US a judge said Samsung infringed Apple's iPad patents while in the Netherlands a court dismissed Samsung's request to block sales of the iPhone and iPad in that country.Peter Black, an intellectual property law lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, said it was important to note the difference between an interim injunction and a final injunction. Last week's ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia was an interim injunction until the court can make a final decision on the patent infringement case, which is due next year."It is easier to obtain an interim injunction than a final injunction," he said. This was because an interim injunction only required that a court be satisfied that the applicant has a prima facie case, meaning that it is more probable than not that it will succeed at trial.He questioned whether the patent system in Australia was actually promoting innovation in software and mobile technologies, or whether the patent system and these endless lawsuits were "in fact stifling competition and innovation, with the customer being the ultimate loser".In seeking to block the sale of the iPhone 4S in Australia, Samsung is relying on the following patents: This reporter is on Twitter: @ashermoses

The new iPhone 4 uses Apple's FaceTime video calling application to allow users to see each while on the phone. The resolution and streaming seems to be top notch, and using Face Time doesn't count as billable minutes. But STILL, somehow, there are some drawbacks.Face Time uses Wi-Fi so you have to be connected to a network in order to use it.Also Face Time only works from one iPhone 4 to another. Users that want video calling with non-iPhone 4 users will be forced to either find other applications or buy all their friends new iPhones.(Negative)BONUS: Even if you COULD get onto this easily and anywhere you want, if you weren't near a charger your conversation probably wouldn't last very long anyway, as apparently the battery on the iPhone 4, even though it's supposedly more powerful by about 40%, really isn't that much better than the one on the 3GS.FaceTime IS great technology, though, and really where phones have been moving towards for the last few years. There's nothing like actually SEEING the people you're speaking for a whole 13 minutes before your battery gives out in the middle of the day.

This is quickly becoming somewhat of a routine event after Apple’s latest iPhone goes on sale: A number of early adopters are having issues with the screens on their new phones. When the iPhone 4 first launched two years ago, quite a few users got devices that had odd yellow spots in some areas, for example. This time around, the issues are a bit more mysterious. Some iPhone 5s, for example, show an odd bubble effect when their users press the screen too hard. Others report that their screens are flickering and are blurry in some areas.It’s not clear how widespread these issues are, but a number of videos that demonstrate these problems have now popped up on YouTube (via Arnold Kim).Here is an example of the odd bubble effect:This user recorded how his phone’s screen flickers for no apparent reason:And here is another example of the bubble effect:On the MacRumors forum, some users also complain about some backlight bleeding issues and on Apple’s own forum, at least one user complained about the fact that the lower part of his screen is blurry and another reported that his phone shows “a wavy line at the bottom and the top of the screen that is slightly discolored.”We will keep tracking this, but let us know if you are having similar issues with your new iPhone 5.

Google has denied the latest rumors that the search giant will bring free turn-by-turn GPS navigation on the Apple iPhone, although the features could come in the future to other (unspecified) mobile platforms.Reports surfaced on Thursday quoting a Google executive speaking about plans to bring free turn-by-turn navigation to other mobile platforms, including the iPhone, during a London press conference launching Maps Navigation for Android phones in the U.K.."We did not say we would bring it to iPhone, we said to date we've had it on Android and that in the future it may come to other platforms but did not confIn Android 2.0, Google introduced Maps Navigation, which includes 3D maps, turn-by-turn voice guidance, and automatic rerouting -- all at no cost for the user. Available initially only in the U.S., the software does not store the maps on your phone, but uses the Internet connection to display routes.However, Google clarified on Thursday a few unknowns about its free navigation software for Android. Maps Navigation pre-caches an entire route, and it needs a data connection only when it calculates the directions. So, while driving to your destination, if you lose the connection temporarily, the route progress will still be displayed as long as you stay on the initial route.Free turn-by-turn navigation for mobile phones is getting increasingly popular with customers, to the detriment of traditional GPS device makerslike TomTomor Garmin. Next to Google's Maps Navigation, now available in both U.S. and U.K., Nokia introduced in January its own free GPS software for several of its devices, and by now has been downloaded more than 10 million times.

I woke up this morning overcome with anticipation, just like the 599,999 other people who pre-ordered the iPhone 4. I pre-ordered my phone through Best Buy, and it proved to be a simple and easy process. Obvious "foreshadowing" alert.Unlike Apple, Best Buy didn't have any lines wrapping around their store, having staggered their iPhone pickups to lessen the load on their employees. I had my phone for about two hours prior to everyone else in the office—two extra hours of blissful "Haha's!," until everyone else finally picked their own up. I fell in love with this phone immediately. The hardware is unparalleled, it is beautifully designed and the glass back really does look stunning (when it's not shattered), and iOS4 runs like a dream with the new processor.I volunteered to test the phone all day, doing reception tests, processor tests, and just about anything else to put phone into numbers on paper. Not only did I volunteer because I had the fortune of picking my phone up before everyone else, but also because by doing these tests I got to play with my new toy all day (as opposed to playing with my new toy all day and being reprimanded for doing no work because I was playing with my new phone all day.)The final test I performed was to see how well the reception held up while traveling by car. I took a cab from the Giz office in Soho up to Times Square, testing the call quality and comparing it to the 3GS. I got out in Times Square, and everyone was flabbergasted that the AT&T network didn't drop either call for over a half an hour.Everything was great in my little world—I was in Times Square with my shiny new iPhone 4. And then the inevitable happened—or what, I imagine, we'll come to think of as the inevitable. I tried to do the little trick where you hold the iPhone 4 just with your left hand and all your bars drop away until you have no service. Note to readers: Don't do this in a crowded intersection during rush hour. I felt my phone slip from my awkwardly positioned fingers—it hung for a moment at the end of my ear bud cord, like a bungee jumper moments before his cord snaps—and then I painfully watched as it tumbled over the curb in a sudden whirl of annihilation. The back glass panel shattered, and so did my heart. OK, that may be a little melodramatic…but I am really upset.It wasn't even that epic of a fall. It hit the curb on its side, didn't really bounce and then sort of flopped over onto its back, facing up. The side that made the initial impact didn't have a scratch on it—funny how that works with steel, right? But with the combination of the force of the phone hitting the ground from about three feet up and the fact that it crashed onto an uneven surface (street curb), it never had a chance. From the terrible shrill it made, I knew it was broken before I even picked it up. It's nothing spectacular dropping and breaking this phone. If anything, a compelling display of destruction would have been a redeeming quality.I shattered my phone hours after buying it, in the line of duty no less. If only Apple decided to make the back of the phone steel. Or rubber. Or leather. Or not fucking glass, the most shatterable material known to man. But hey, I'm trying to think optimistically here; at least it wasn't the front screen that cracked, and the look gives it character... I guess.

Oh, you knew this was going to happen. Samsung is not taking the release of the iPhone 5 lying down. A new ad declares Apple's phone isn't genius.I don't think they've kissed and made up yet.When one party embarrasses another so badly -- and in public -- you don't expect the hurt one to just take it, do you?And so Samsung is greeting the arrival of the iPhone 5 with an ad that will run tomorrow in certain national and local newspapers (how modern). It is not a flattering ad. It suggests that the iPhone 5 isn't even good enough to be, well, a copy of the Galaxy S3.Clearly, it's been hastily put together, but its headline -- "It doesn't take a genius" -- rather prepares you for what follows.Yes, it's a list of all the fine, rational reasons why the Galaxy S3 is vintage port compared to the iPhone 5's wine-in-a-box.Oh, the Galaxy S3 is full of things the iPhone doesn't have: Palm Swipe Capture, Shake to Update, oh, and NFC -- to name but three.And though there's no doubt that the S3 is a fine phone -- especially for those with hands handed down by gorillas -- there is one small element that Samsung might be overlooking.People don't buy the iPhone for all the features. They buy it for all those quirky, irrational, emotional, maddening reasons that make people's eyes glaze over and their minds work like a blancmange clock.Samsung's biggest problem isn't that its phone doesn't have some fine rational attributes. It's that the brand hasn't captured hearts.There are no lists nor self-help books that can tell you how to do that. That does, sometimes, take a little genius.

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

AT&T is making an attempt to quietly settle with the iPhone user who was recently awarded $850 in a lawsuit over AT&T's data-throttling practices, but the user in question doesn't want any part of it. Instead, he's committed to fighting AT&T and hopes other subscribers follow his example by taking AT&T to court over the throttling of supposed "unlimited" data plans, and has taken his cause to a website called PublikDemand to get others involved.Matthew Spaccarelli won an $850 judgement against AT&T in a California small-claims court in late February when the court found that it wasn't fair for AT&T to slow down data speeds under his iPhone's unlimited data plan. Spaccarelli had argued that he was being throttled after using 1.5GB to 2GB of data in one billing cycle—well within the 3GB tiered plan AT&T currently offers to customers for the same price ($30 per month) as the now-defunct unlimited plan.When AT&T phased out the unlimited plan, however, the carrier allowed existing subscribers to be grandfathered in and continue using it. But Spaccarelli wasn't just downloading 1.5 to 2GB of data on his iPhone—he was using his phone to share the data access with his iPad without paying the extra fee required by AT&T for tethering/hotspot service. This was a violation of AT&T's terms of service, causing the carrier to switch his plan to a limited one. Spaccarelli complained, however, and had it changed back to an unlimited plan.Now, according to the Associated Press, AT&T has sent a letter to Spaccarelli demanding that he participate in settlement talks or his phone service may be shut down. Spaccarelli posted the documents online—something AT&T's letter specifically asks him not to do—in hopes that his case emboldens others like him to follow suit.  "Looks like #att is threatening to cut off my service if I don't sign a confidentiality agreement to talk about settling. I thought I won!!" Spaccarelli posted to Twitter on Tuesday. In another tweet, he directed users to PublikDemand "to get help with small claims court against AT&T."Correction: AT&T reached out to us for clarification, saying that the letter says if he chose to engage in settlement talks, there would be a standard mutual NDA. Spaccarelli's service would only be terminated if he agreed to the settlement but violated the signed agreement.

The iPhone 4 may be available to the general public, but the police investigation into the leaked device that Gizmodo purchased last spring is still going strong. Now there’s been a new development: the EFF reports that the San Mateo District Attorney has withdrawn the warrant it used to search Gizmodo editor Jason Chen’s house last April, when it confiscated multiple computers, hard drives, and other electronics.Update: The Wall Street Journal reports that Gawker has reached an agreement with investigators. Chen’s materials will be returned, and Gawker/Chen will be voluntarily handing over materials deemed “relevant to the case” by a court appointee.The seizure of these possessions was quite controversial — the EFF said it was illegal and should have been protected by California’s Shield Law. When I called the District Attorney about the case in April, I was told that the investigation was on hold as these issues were considered, and that Chen’s property was sitting in a warehouse untouched. It’s apparently been sitting there for months. At the time, I noted how bizarre the series of events were:When I asked if it was typical for the DA to evaluate the relevance of these shield laws after removing evidence, Wagstaffe did concede that it was unusual. Which makes the situation extremely od d— it should have been readily apparent that Gawker would defend its actions using this shield law defense, why put the brakes on after the fact?However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Chen is in the clear. The EFF says that police could “attempt to subpoena the same material without running afoul of section 1524(g) and still proceed with their case.”

Samsung has recently been at the courts against Apple in the US. Unfortunately, as we all know, Apple has had one major win against Samsung – resulting in a $1.05 billion fine for the South Korean tech giant.So, when Apple went on to announce (and soon release) the iPhone 5, Samsung wasn’t going to take this lying down. Samsung have made a quite hilarious poster which displays the similarities and differences of the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S III.It’s probably worth mentioning too that we don’t know the exact differences between the A6 and Exynos 4 chips found inside – but we do know that the Galaxy S III’s Exynos is quite a powerful chip set. Most of the differences come in the form of design and software additions, but it’s good to see that the iPhone 5 is on-par (or slightly worse off) then a device that was launched 3 months ago. Feast your eyes on this:

Google's brand-new Android developer advocate, Tim Bray, wasn't afraid to start his first day on the company's payroll by taking some shots at a rival. "A sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers" were the words he used to describe Apple's iPhone platform. Bray was most recently employed at Sun Microsystems and is a longtime open source advocate.Sun Microsystems' loss was Google's gain on Monday, as former Sun guru Tim Bray announced that he's joined Google's Android push in the role of Developer Advocate."Google and I have been a plausible match for a long time," Bray wrote in a blog post announcing the decision. "Web-centric, check. Search, check. Open-source, check. The list goes on."Still, "the reason I'm here is mostly Android," he added, calling the platform "about as unambiguously a good thing as the tangled wrinkly human texture of the Net can sustain just now."Bray resigned in late February from his position as director of Web technologies at Sun and declined an offer from Oracle in the meantime, he said. He will work remotely for Google from his current Vancouver, B.C., location.A longtime open source advocate, Bray's background includes cofounding the Open Text Corporation as well as launching Canadian business analytics firm Antarctica Systems.He also worked on XML for the World Wide Web Consortium.Bray has written numerous software applications, including Unix file system benchmarking tool Bonnie, XML processor Lark and APE -- the Atom Protocol Exerciser.In his new role at Google, Bray didn't waste time before firing a few shots at Apple.The iPhone platform is "a sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers," Bray wrote. "The people who create the apps serve at the landlord's pleasure and fear his anger. I hate it."The iPhone's hardware and software may be great, but "freedom's not just another word for anything, nor is it an optional ingredient," he explained."Apple apparently thinks you can have the benefits of the Internet while at the same time controlling what programs can be run and what parts of the stack can be accessed and what developers can say to each other," he added. "I think they're wrong and see this job as a chance to help prove it."Bray also admitted he still has much to learn about the platform: "Are you an Android developer? Or might you become one? Or have you given up on Android? If you're any of these, you're a person I need to learn from," he said."Bray's addition to Google generally and to Android specifically is a win for both," RedMonk analyst Stephen O'Grady told LinuxInsider. "Tim's intimately familiar with the Java ecosystem and, better, what it's done right and what it's done wrong. For that alone, his hiring would be worth it."Even more important, however, is Bray's open-mindedness, O'Grady said."He has never been a Java bigot; he was a staunch advocate for dynamic languages and the REST architectural style during his tenure at Sun," O'Grady explained. "Whether that experience will manifest itself directly within the Android project is unclear, but he'll certainly look to keep the ecosystem as open as possible."In short, "Google just gained themselves a widely respected and pragmatic developer advocate," he concluded.Indeed, "it is a shrewd move to bring Tim Bray in as a figurehead for Android development," 451 group analyst Jay Lyman agreed. "As he's already demonstrated with some of his comments about the competition, he's not afraid to speak his mind nor to challenge others, whether he is competing or collaborating with them."Lyman recently wrote a like-minded blog post about Apple and the opportunity it's created by keeping its platform closed.While such assets have a potential to "contribute to further fragmentation for Android," they should serve him well in his new role, Lyman predicted."His technical and software development accomplishment and background combined with his outgoing nature should make him a good match for head Android wrangler," Lyman told LinuxInsider.

iUsers with unmeddled tech must wait for Apple patchThe latest jailbreak for iPhones, published on Wednesday, exploits a zero-day bug in iOS that only users of jailbroken devices will be able to fix, security experts warn.Version 3 of jailbreakme.com, which also works on iPad fondleslabs, takes advantage of a PDF-related vulnerability in iOS. Users of jailbroken devices can use PDF Patcher 2 to guard against the underlying flaw while users of regular devices will have to wait for a patch from Apple. Jailbroken devices allow the installing of apps besides those approved by the official Apple App Store."It's as serious as last time when jailbreakme.com was using a zeroday," notes Mikko Hyponnen of Finnish security firm F-Secure. "Last time nothing bad happened, as Apple patched fast."Apple does not allow anti-virus software to be listed in the official iPhone AppStore, so there's no protection via this route until a patch for the underlying vulnerability is published by Apple.The "temporary" vulnerability of unaltered iPhones and fondleslabs illustrates one security shortfall of the locked-down walled-garden approach practised by Apple. The more laissez-faire approach followed by Google with Android has seen an upswing in malicious code targeted against Droid phones, however. iPhone malware remains even rarer than the low levels of Droid Trojans in circulation but, even so, the potential for badness is still there. ®

After successful attacks on Safari and Internet Explorer 8 on Wednesday, the second day of Pwn2Own saw the iPhone 4 and then the BlackBerry Torch 9800 successfully exploited. The annual security competition allows researchers to win any systems that they successfully compromise, and also awards them cash rewards if those security flaws are still present in the latest version of the software.The iPhone was hacked by Pwn2Own veteran Charlie Miller working with Dion Blazakis. In the last three years, Miller has successfully pwned both Apple's phones and laptops at the competition, and he kept his winning streak going this year with a successful attack on the iPhone 4. The flaw used to pwn the iPhone was in its Mobile Safari Web browser; the phone was compromised simply by visiting a specially-crafted Web page, which allowed Miller to run exploit code that allowed him to access the phone's address book.Past Pwn2Own competitions have required the contestants to test against the latest version of the software under attack, even if released on the day of the competition. This year, the software was frozen last week, preventing the use of last-minute patches to avoid exploitation. Successful exploits of the week-old configuration win the hardware, and if the exploit still exists in the latest software, money is also paid out for the flaw.The iPhone was running iOS 4.2.1, as its software was frozen prior to this week's release of iOS 4.3. However, Miller was awarded both the hardware and the money: the same security flaw is found in the newest version of Apple's operating system. Demonstrating the significance of the rule changes, however, was the fact that his exploit no longer worked. iOS 4.3 introduces Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and his exploit code did not take measures to defeat this operating system protection.The next platform to be tested was BlackBerry OS running on a BlackBerry Torch 9800, and this was duly cracked by a team made up of Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and Ralf Philipp Weinmann. Iozzo and Weinmann are also Pwn2Own veterans, pwning the iPhone in 2010. The BlackBerry OS attack exploited a flaw in the operating system's new WebKit-based browser. As with the other hacks demonstrated at the competition, merely visiting a specially-crafted Web page was sufficient to compromise the device.The trio of researchers said that attack was difficult to pull off, not because of operating system protections like Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and ASLR—BlackBerryOS 6 lacks both—but because the system is essentially a black box, with no public documentation about its internals, few useful software tools, and little known about its workings. Even after finding the initial security flaw, converting this into a useful exploit was difficult. In the event, they had to chain together three separate flaws to achieve a successful compromise, using information garnered from two information disclosure issues in conjunction with a third integer overflow flaw to run their exploit code.WebKit, in contrast to BlackBerry OS, is open source and widely studied as a result of its use in both Chrome and Safari: in moving to the modern browser, RIM has arguably made its platform more approachable to hackers and researchers alike. Were it not for this obscurity, the lack of DEP, ASLR, and code signing would leave it easy to attack, with Iozzo describing it as "way behind the iPhone at the moment, from a security perspective."The attack was demonstrated on BlackBerry OS 6.0.0.246. RIM has shipped a newer firmware since, but Pinckaers has confirmed that the flaw still exists.Also due to be tested on Thursday were Firefox, and phones running Android and Windows Phone 7. However, Firefox contestant Sam Thomas withdrew as he felt his exploit wasn't stable, and the competitors on the other platforms failed to turn up. This means that those platforms, in addition to Chrome (which also had its attacker withdraw), are so far undefeated. There is a possibility that this may change on Friday, the final day of the competition.

Who is she? Chinese netizens are hunting the iPhone girl.China's "human flesh search engine" is in hot pursuit of an unnamed Chinese factory worker after photographs of her showed up unexpectedly on a new iPhone 3G purchased recently in Britain.In one of the photos, a young woman dressed in a pink striped factory uniform and wearing a matching white cap and rubber gloves, is seen smiling and flashing a "V" sign as she leans over an iPhone assembly line.The photos were discovered by an iPhone user in Britain who promptly posted his find on the MacRumors forum, setting off a global chain reaction of media interest and culminating in the quest by Chinese internet users to discover her identity.The term "human flesh search engine" refers to this type of mob reaction by China's so-called netizens (internet citizens) to pool their collective resources in order to track someone down.In China, Apple uses the giant Taiwanese company FoxConn to assemble its iPods and iPhones. The company's main factories are based in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen, the booming city next door to Hong Kong.FoxConn representatives have confirmed to several Chinese newspapers that the woman - dubbed the "iPhone girl" - is an employee of the company.The spokesman said workers had most probably been testing the phone's camera and had forgotten to delete the photos. He said those involved would not be fired for the mistake."Small mistakes are unavoidable," the news agency AFP quoted FoxConn spokesman Liu Kun as saying. "I would call this a beautiful mistake."He said the factory worker in the photos was "quite nervous" after her face appeared on websites and in newspapers.FoxConn, which employs over 270,000 people in its Shenzhen factories, has said it will not be revealing the woman's identity.But Chinese journalists and bloggers have already narrowed the search down to the quality control section on the fifth floor of one of the FoxConn factory buildings - where up to 1000 employees reportedly work.Of the six photos in the set found on the iPhone, two are of the "iPhone girl" and four are of the factory in which the phones are assembled.The images have since been plastered all over the Chinese internet and as of the time of writing, there were over 20 million searches for the term "iPhone girl" recorded on Google's Chinese search site, google.cn.In addition, the domain names iphonegirl.net and iphonegirl.cn have been snapped up by web users trying to cash in on the sudden surge of interest.In 2006, Apple conducted an investigation into the work practises of FoxConn after reports emerged of sub-standard working conditions.Apple found there were some instances of overcrowding in worker dormitories and some evidence of over-working and harsh treatment - all oversights FoxConn agreed to rectify.

A federal court decision ruled that Samsung owes Apple more than $1 billion in restitution. Samsung plans to appeal the decision, saying it never attempted to steal anything from Apple's iPhone.Next week, on September 12, Apple is expected to introduce its highly anticipated iPhone 5, but the company may find itself on the receiving end of a patent-infringement battle. Chinese tech company Goophone is launching the Goophone I5, which looks suspiciously like an iPhone in the company's video on YouTube.In recent months, tech blogs all over the world have released leaked photos and videos of what is rumored to be Apple's iPhone 5. The pictures show what appears to be a longer, thinner, but altogether similar version of previous models of the best-selling smartphone in the world. The Goophone I5 will run a version of the Android operating system that mimics the look of Apple's IOS. Goophone claims to have already patented its phone in China and vows to sue for patent infringement should Apple try to release the iPhone 5 in China as well.One commenter on Goophone's YouTube account wrote, "the clone wants to sue the original...THIS IS THE FUTURE!" Of course, since the new iPhone 5 does not technically exist for the public yet, we'll just have to wait and see.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs hated the Android smartphone operating system so much that he vowed he would spend his last dying breath and every penny Apple had in the bank trying to destroy it. Android, created by Google, entered the market after Apple but soon gained greater market share. A lot of Apple fans dismiss Android as a ripoff of Apple’s ideas, and a crappy one at that.But oddly enough, Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Jobs in 1976, says he’s a big fan of Android phones. Woz says he still thinks Apple’s iPhone is the best overall smartphone, but he says there are ways in which Android has leapt ahead of Apple.Android phones aren’t as simple to use as the iPhone, but they’re not that much more complicated, and “if you’re willing to do the work to understand it a little bit, well I hate to say it, but there’s more available in some ways,” Woz says.There’s a theory that Android could do to iOS (Apple’s mobile operating system) what Microsoft Windows did to the Macintosh in the 1990s. Microsoft triumphed because it licensed its software to many different hardware makers and ultimately had much greater market share than Apple, which would only sell its operating system on its own hardware.In the mobile space, Apple is using the same playbook, tying its software tightly to its own hardware. And with Android, Apple is facing the same kind of foe that it once faced in Windows. “I can see the similarity,” Woz says.Worse yet, this time, he says, Apple is up against a stronger competitor, since in his mind Windows was never a very good program, while Android actually is. “There’s not as big a difference [between iOS and Android] as there was between Mac and Windows,” he says.The other difference involves applications. It took a long time before applications looked as good on Windows as they did on the Mac. But with Android, that’s not the case. In fact, in some ways Android might have an edge.“I used to ask Siri, ‘What are the five biggest lakes in California?’ and it would come back with the answer. Now it just misses. It gives me real estate listings. I used to ask, ‘What are the prime numbers greater than 87?’ and it would answer. Now instead of getting prime numbers, I get listings for prime rib, or prime real estate,” Woz says.Worse, a lot of the time Siri says it can’t make a connection to the back-end servers that power the system. “With the iPhone 4 I could press a button and call my wife. Now on the 4S I can only do that when Siri can connect over the Internet. But many times it can’t connect. I’ve never had Android come back and say, ‘I can’t connect over the Internet.’”The Android system also delivers better results, he says. “I have a lower success rate with Siri than I do with the voice built into the Android, and that bothers me,” Woz says. “I’ll be saying, over and over again in my car, ‘Call the Lark Creek Steak House,’ and I can’t get it done. Then I pick up my Android, say the same thing, and it’s done. Plus I get navigation. Android is way ahead on that.”Another gripe involves battery life. “With the iPhone, something happened with the new OS or the new phone, and it just started running through the battery so fast,” he says. “I’ve had a lot of issues with things I have to turn off just to save the battery life.”But Woz says he still recommends the iPhone as the best choice for most users. “The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it’s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don’t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person who is scared of complexity, well, here’s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do,” he says.

Better known for its automobiles, Nissan has shifted gears to the realm of electronics accessories with a new scratchproof iPhone case. More accurately, the cover is susceptible to scratches, but it can automatically "heal" them courtesy of a special paint the Japanese automaker developed in 2005.Dubbed Scratch Shield, the polyrotaxane-based paint has been used on the company's Murano, 370Z, X-Trail and Infiniti vehicles. When gashed, the chemical structure reacts by changing back to its original shape, thus mending the damage. Here's a quick demo from 2008 showing the solution in action:The clip shows a minor abrasion healing over a brief period (the video is only a minute long, but the description sounds as if it's elapsed over half an hour -- impressive regardless). Nissan's press release says Scratch Shield can heal small nicks in as little as an hour, while deeper cuts can take up to a week.Compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S, the Scratch Shield case is constructed from ABS plastic and was developed in conjunction with the University of Tokyo and Advanced Softmaterials. In addition to its self-repairing properties, the gel-like paint offers a grippy surface instead of a slick glossy coating.The product currently exists in prototype form and is being tested by select journalists and customers. There's no word on pricing, but if there appears to be enough demand, Nissan will ship the finished product later this year. It's also partnering with other companies interested in using Scratch Shield, such as NTT DoCoMo."We're really excited about the possibilities provided by this technology. In Japan, we've already linked up with world-leading mobile operator NTT DoCoMo to allow them to use the Scratch Shield technology on its Style Series N-03B mobile phones, and we think this technology has real scope beyond the automotive world."

Nokia has just announced that it has sued Apple in Federal District Court in t"The patents in question relate to technologies for enhanced speech and data transmission, using positioning data in applications and innovations in antenna configurations that improve performance and save space, allowing smaller and more compact devices," according to a statement from the company.Although the wording is of course somewhat vague, the suit appears to hit the heart of what has made applications on the iPad and iPhone what they are. Positioning data in applications has become a central feature -- most of the major ones carry some type of location-aware technology.Nokia's suit surely comes as a surprise to the tech community, as it had not publicly made any indication that it believed its intellectual property rights had been violated. That said, it's not the first suitbetween the two companies: a suit last year involved GSM, UMTS, and Wi-Fi standards. A request for comment has been sent to Apple, however no response has been received as of press time. Also, Apple has sued HTCfor patent infringement. (See also "7 Patent Lawsuits That Affect Your Tech.")More details to come as we receive them.

Popular blog, iFixit, which says it takes apart tech gadgets in order to examine and fix them, says the latest version of Apple's iPhone 4 comes with tamper-resistant screws. The non-standard torx screw is a pentalobe IFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a blog post. He said Apple has used the pentalobular shaped screw for versions of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. The screws are so rare, he said he couldn't find a single supplier that made it.Wiens says the screw, which he says is roughly a millimeter across in size, is an effort by Apple to make the iPhone 4 impossible dissemble and keep its repair in their hands. Apple has traditionally has liked to maintain complete control over its products.The iPhone 4 is an easy device to work on. Because it's an easy device, that's why they are locking it out, Wiens said. He compared device hardware to a car, and his blog to a third-party auto repair shop.  If you buy a car, you can do what you want with it. It's the same thing with your phone. It's not Apple's phone, it's your phone.To solve the problem, iFixit says it's offering a $10 iPhone 4 Liberation Kit. The kit comes with a pentalobe screwdriver, replacement Phillips screws and a Phillips screwdriver. Wiens does not recommend repeated use of the pentalobe screwdriver, saying it's a hack to get the screws out and then replace them with standard screws. He says the screwdrivers were custom made.iFix is not the only one to have noticed the problem.Another pentalobe screwdriver is being offered by Silverhill Tools on Amazon, for seven dollars.iFixit says the iPhone 4 originally shipped with easy to disassemble Phillips #00 screws. However, the company is now shipping production of new U.S. units with the pentalobe screws. He also says when people take their iPhone in for service, Apple employees will switch the Phillips screw with the pentalobe screw.This is a design to decrease the life of these devices, which increases Apple's revenue cause you have to buy a replacement, Wiens said.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Recording, communicating during protests, political events could be restrictedApple was granted a patent last week that will enable it to wirelessly disable the camera on iphones in certain locations, sparking fears that such techniques could be used to prevent citizens from communicating with each other or taking video during protests or events such as political conventions and gatherings.The camera phone has revolutionized the flow of information in the digital age. Any time a major event takes place, news networks and video websites are immediately inundated with footage and photographs from the scene.That could all change in the future however, with a flick of a switch, according to U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, published on Tuesday, titled, “Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device.”.Apparatus and methods for changing one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device, such as upon the occurrence of a certain event. In one embodiment, the event comprises detecting that the wireless device is within range of one or more other devices. In another variant, the event comprises the wireless device associating with a certain access point. In this manner, various aspects of device functionality may be enabled or restricted (device “policies”). This policy enforcement capability is useful for a variety of reasons, including for example to disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater), for preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter “sleep mode” when entering a sensitive area.In other words, an encoded signal could be transmitted to all wireless devices, commanding them to disable recording functions.Obviously, the way this will be applied will depend on what is determined to be a “sensitive area” by the relevant authorities.To put it bluntly, the powers that be could control what you can and cannot document on your wireless devices according to their own whims.Given that the major technology companies are set to make wireless connectivity a major feature of the latest cameras, this development does not bode well for photographers and citizen journalists who are already experiencing a major crackdown on their first and fourth amendment rights.“If this type of technology became widely adopted and baked into cameras, photography could be prevented by simply setting a “geofence” around a particular location, whether it’s a movie theater, celebrity hangout spot, protest site, or the top secret rooms at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California.”Steve Watson is the London based writer and editor for Alex Jones’ Infowars.com, and Prisonplanet.com.

They say everyone's a critic these days, but here's a group whose critique matters: European carriers. Reuters has been asking questions at four major European telecom operators and reports that they're all dissatisfied with the company's current range of Lumia handsets. Describing the Windows Phone devices as overpriced due to their lack of real innovation, glitchy due to early battery life issues, and inadequately supported by Nokia's own marketing, the carriers seem to be in consensus about the new phones' failure to put up real competition to iOS and Android. Put in starker terms, they don't believe that Nokia's Lumia phones are "good enough" to compete. An executive in charge of mobile phones at one of the big Euro carriers is cited as saying, "no one comes into the store and asks for a Windows Phone," placing at least some of the blame for the tepid start to Nokia's reboot on Microsoft's shoulders."If the Lumia with the same hardware came with Android in it and not Windows, it would be much easier to sell."Credit rating agency Moody's has also been piling on, following Nokia's recent warning about lower-than-expected Q1 earnings, downgrading the Finnish company to a Baa3 rating and its outlook to "negative." Still, in Moody's more detailed assessment, Nokia is expected to be "accepted in the market in 2012," with Windows Phone becoming the third leading mobile platform behind iOS and Android.

You can make calls, read books, and listen to music on this flexible computer from Canada. But do you really want to keep bending it to make it work?How many times have you wanted to smash your phone when talking to annoying people? Thanks to research at Queen's University in Canada, you'll soon be able to crush that handset mercilessly. Well, almost.The e-paper prototype PaperPhone has a 3.75-inch thin-film display and developers call it the world's first flexible smartphone (remember Nokia's patent application for one?). It can do everything a smartphone can, such as make calls, display books, and play music."This is the future. Everything is going to look and feel like this within five years," Queen's Human Media Lab Director Roel Vertegaal was quoted as saying in a release.As seen in the vid below, the prototype is based on e-ink technology and is more like a bendable plastic sheet about the thickness of a conference badge. It can be operated by bending the corners to turn a page, squeezing to make a call, and even written on with a pen.The lab has also been working on video game screens that are bent as a control input.Larger versions of the displays could eliminate paper and printers from offices, according to Vertegaal. E-ink displays require no power until the screen is refreshed, but for the time being the PaperPhone display is connected to an external power source.Vertegaal, who collaborated with researchers Byron Lahey and Win Burleson of the Motivational Environments Research Group at Arizona State University, is set to discuss the prototype at the Computer Human Interaction 2011 conference next week in Vancouver.So how flexible is it, really? Can it be crumpled up?"We haven't actually tried that--creasing it," Vertegaal told PC Mag. "It's a $7,000 prototype, so we're pretty careful with it. If you were to put a crease in it, you would break it. But there are engineering solutions for that."

An app that features a less than entirely honest Hollywood wheeler-dealer has been removed from Apple's App Store after a complaint from a super agent.I am sure honest Hollywood agents do exist. It's just that they don't seem to employ the finest PR firms to proselytize their honesty.This might explain why Oisin Hanrahan, the Irish creator of an iPhone app called SuperAgent, decided that the main character in his game might be a few scruples short of Mother Teresa.SuperAgent seems to have been well received, a reception that might have led to its being noticed by, well, Hollywood super agents.According to the Independent, one super agent may have enjoyed a particular interest in this app. His name is Ari Emanuel. He is the agent for so many important acting citizens such as Robert De Niro and Sacha Baron Cohen as well as directors such as Spike Lee. He is even thought to be the person upon whom the character of Ari Gold is based in the delightfully fluffy "Entourage" on HBO.What is important for today's story, however, is that he has reportedly set his more toothsome legal dogs upon Oisin Hanrahan and his company, Factory Six. You see, the slightly less than honest agent in the SuperAgent game is called Ari.While I leave you to gather your breath for a moment, let me just whisper that it is not the mere mention of Emanuel's first name that appears to have ruffled his hairline.The Independent kindly offers details of the cease-and-desist letter that has caused Apple to remove SuperAgent from the App Store."The game uses the name 'Ari' for the main character, which clearly is a reference to Mr Emanuel, the co-chief executive officer of WME, one of the world's premier talent agencies," begins the forceful cease-and-desist letter.It continues as forcefully it began: "[It] clearly intends to capitalize on using Mr Emanuel's and WME's names for the game and possibly mislead the public into thinking that Mr Emanuel and/or WME endorse the game - effectively trading off the goodwill, reputation and fame established by our clients."Hanrahan deftly told the Independent that because of the "Entourage" series, "Ari" is a name that symbolizes Hollywood in general, not one person in particular. He added: "We're a very small firm, of just three people, and since Apple pulled it we have had no income."I feel sure that many of you will sympathize with Hanrahan's plight. His arguments appear plausible. His game, just as the "Entourage" show, seems but an amusing diversion from the pains of everyday existence.But perhaps others might consider that while saying truth to power is an often alluring concept, one should always think carefully before saying jokes to power. Power is a sensitive soul, one that isn't always comfortable with japes. Somehow, for some powerful souls, taking a joke is like Samson admitting he'd always wondered what it would like to be bald.

I realize that freedom of speech doesn't extend to your interactions with private parties, but it's still a tenant I think is important. Removing apps because people disagree with their content sets a bad precedent, even though I'm disgusted by this one.Actions like this mean you are not in control of your own devices. This is why I don't own an iPhone. I'm not interested in having what I can and can't use my phone for change at the whims of Steve Jobs. As an Android user, I'm glad Google sticks to its policy of only removing apps in cases of copyright infringement or malicious code.Consider the case when the ACLU defended the KKK's right to non-libel free speech. They got a lot of flak for doing so, but they defended themselves by saying that freedom of speech isn't really free if we selectively remove it from those with whom we disagree. They weren't defending their right to do anything downright malicious either. I think the catalyzing even was that there was some sort of community event that openly invited any interested organizations to come, but they blocked the KKK from attending.I think the philosophy is the same here, despite free speech laws not applying. This same sort of policy could prevent apps from being published that your average redditor would love, but more conservative types would find offensive.EDIT: I encourage any would-be downvoters to first read this article from AfterElton, a pro-gay blog: http://www.afterelton.com/other/2011/03/disappointed-apple-pulls-ex-gay-app

Nissan isn?t the first name most associate with the cutting edge of gadget case technology, but their self-healing Scratch Shield iPhone case has the potential to be a revolutionary product in an already oversaturated market. The technology behind the ?self-repairing? case technology isn?t new, it?s been in use on several Nissan and Infiniti car models since 2005. The collaborative effort between the University of Tokyo and Advanced Soft Materials INC consists of an ?outer ?paint? made from polyrotaxane, which means that when damage occurs to the coating in the form of a fine scratch, the chemical structure is able to react to change back to its original shape and fill the gap ? ?healing? the blemish? according to Nissan. Nissan soft-launched the case over the weekend at an automotive event held in Dubai. Nissan handed a number of cases out to customers and journalists for beta testing and announced that if the demand was strong enough they would consider mass producing the cases for a release to the general public. Hopefully the beta testing creates a strong buzz, but that all depends on how well the self-healing feature of case works in real world use.The pockets of gadget owners can be unforgiving dungeons capable of scratching the toughest reinforced screens, and cases. However, if the underlying technology of Nissan?s cases has been used on cars for the last five years, I?m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the material's ability to withstand consumers' pockets.

As part of its case against Samsung, Apple has shown snippets of an internal Samsung document comparing the original Galaxy S phone with the iPhone.On Tuesday, Apple managed to get the whole 132-page document admitted into evidence. And it’s a doozy.The 2010 report, translated from Korean, goes feature by feature, evaluating how Samsung’s phone stacks up against the iPhone.Authored by Samsung’s product engineering team, the document evaluates everything from the home screen to the browser to the built-in apps on both devices. In each case, it comes up with a recommendation on what Samsung should do going forward, and in most cases, its answer is simple: Make it work more like the iPhone.In short, the evaluation report makes the case that the Galaxy (identified here as the “S1?) would be better if it behaved more like the iPhone and featured a similar user interface. And it appears to play directly into Apple’s charge that Samsung “slavishly copied” the iPhone.Samsung has been trying to make the case that the arrival of powerful capacitive touchscreens pushed the whole industry toward something like the iPhone. This document helps show how one can have a similarly sized slab of glass and still come up short — as Samsung itself concludes it did, initially.Of course, to win its case, Apple will have to prove not just that Samsung made its phones more iPhone-like, but that it either infringed on the specific design and utility patents at issue, or that it infringes on specific design elements of the iPhone and iPad — what’s known in legal terms as “trade dress.”In court on Tuesday, Apple called a number of experts to testify that the similarity of Samsung’s products to Apple’s is more than coincidence and constitutes infringement.Samsung is arguing both that its products don’t infringe, and that Apple’s designs and functions weren’t patent-worthy in the first place.Anyway, have a look for yourself and you’ll see why Samsung wasn’t too keen on this getting in front of the jury. Here’s a direct link to the document if the embed below isn’t working properly.Reached for comment, a Samsung representative told AllThingsD that this document isn’t nearly as damning as it might appear: “Samsung benchmarks many peer companies,” the rep said. “In fact, these are typical competitive analyses routinely undertaken by many companies in many industries – including Apple. Samsung stands by its culture of continuous improvement and innovation. We are very proud of the product innovations driven by our more than 50,000 designers and engineers around the world who have made Samsung’s products the products of choice.”

Then, without any warning or error message, the phone quit.Everything was gone — all her contacts, photos and even the phone's ability to make calls.It was only after she got home to Silicon Valley that she found out that her phone had been killed by her employer, a publishing company.Someone in the IT department had sent out what's called a "remote wipe," a kind of auto-destruct command that's delivered by e-mail. The wipe was done by mistake, and Stanton wouldn't have been surprised to see this kind of remote control on a company phone.But this iPhone was hers."It was my account, in my name [and] I'd paid all the bills," Stanton says. "It didn't make any sense to me that somehow work could get through AT&T, who I thought controlled my phone, and could completely disable the phone and the account."It's no surprise to people who know IT. Since 2003, a growing list of smart phones have come loaded with software from Microsoft that makes remote wipes — and many other remote-control commands — possible.The phone doesn't need to download any new software. All that's necessary is for the phone's user to configure it to receive e-mail from a Microsoft Exchange Server — the kind most big companies use.Once that's been set up, an IT department has the capability to wipe the phone and turn off functions like Bluetooth, the Web browser and even the phone's camera."The reason why you see such a long list of various policies and controls is because different organizations want those controls," says Adam Glick, senior technical product manager for Microsoft Exchange.He points to the peace of mind the system offers to people whose phones have been stolen, and who can rest assured that all the personal information contained inside can be erased from afar.Glick says employers sometimes need remote control of other functions, like the camera, to prevent leaks. "If you're having an important meeting about the future finances of the organization and people put that up on a slide, and someone might take out their camera phone and take a picture. And then they might go and, say, post that to the Internet," Glick says.But when companies exert that kind of control over someone's personal phone, things can get messy. Anthony Davis runs IT for a manufacturing company in Seattle, and he says he makes a point of letting people know that when they opt to get company e-mail on their personal phones, they're signing up for more than just e-mail."We actually have a one-page waiver that says, you know, if you're going to connect your personal phone to the corporate e-mail system, that we do have the capabilities if the phone is lost to remote wipe it — and we will — and then have the employee agree [to] and sign that form," Davis says.But companies often aren't that transparent about the power e-mail gives them over personal phones. And it's not just phones.IT administrators can send similar commands to iPads and other personal devices that get work e-mail. Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute, says he's not sure what a court would say about a company that wipes an employee's phone without permission.But he says he'd like to find out: "I'm salivating right now at the prospect of this lawsuit."Maltby says there's now a breakdown of the old paradigm that your company controls work devices and you control yours and "never the twain shall meet.""Now, you have this gray world in which everything overlaps, and everything that's personal is business and vice versa, and now it's a mess," he says.Putting work e-mail on a personal device may be convenient, but for Stanton it's no longer worth the risk.After restoring her iPhone — or, as she calls it, her "precious iPhone" — she says she'll never put work e-mail on it again.

Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been effusive about the iPhone’s merits ever since the carrier won the right to sell the popular Apple device. On Wednesday, Hesse added another compliment to the list. The iPhone is so data-efficient, he said, it will help Sprint keep its mobile data plans unlimited.That point, which Hesse made in an interview with Forbes following Sprint’s third-quarter earnings, could influence other wireless carriers as well as investors and consumers. Sprint, after all, is the only “big four” U.S. carrier that continues to offer an unlimited data plan with its smartphones. Industry observers often speculate when Sprint will have to adopt tiered pricing like AT&T and Verizon Wireless.Sprint is still not saying when it may make that switch, but credits the iPhone for helping it push the date out further. “One of the beauties of carrying the iPhone is it extends the period of time and increases the likelihood of us maintaining unlimited data longer because it uses our network so efficiently,” said Hesse.There are two main reasons why the iPhone rides lightly on networks, according to Hesse. The first is that the device is good at hunting for Wi-Fi connections and notifying users when Wi-Fi is available. That helps carriers like Sprint offload data traffic from their networks.The iPhone’s other strength stems from Apple’s tight control over iPhone applications. Since Apple makes iPhone apps meet network efficiency thresholds, iPhone apps tend to “ping” networks less often than other mobile operating systems do. Cutting down on app “noise” lets carriers operate their networks in a more productive and ultimately more profitable manner. “It’s almost like a Prius,” said Hesse, comparing the iPhone to Toyota’s fuel-efficient car.Sprint, of course, would like to keep its data plans unlimited as long as possible. The policy is one of the key advantages the No. 3 carrier has over its larger rivals. It is also Sprint’s principal selling point for the iPhone, which can also be purchased at AT&T and Verizon Wireless. “Our main [marketing] message is around unlimited,” noted Hesse. “It is what makes us distinct.”Earlier this month, Sprint ended unlimited data access for users of its mobile broadband and hotspot services. The move sparked chatter that Sprint would cap data for smartphones, too. Hesse said Sprint was forced to amend its mobile broadband policy because of network congestion but that smartphones have not reached that point yet. “Data cards are much heavier users of our network than smartphones,” he said. “It’s still quite profitable for us to keep unlimited [data] on smartphones.”Unlike AT&T and Verizon Wireless, Sprint did not reveal how many iPhones it sold during its launch in the final two weeks of the third quarter. Hesse told Forbes Sprint would not disclose iPhone sales figures until the company had “a full quarter of sales under its belt.” Instead, he spoke more generally, saying Sprint was “very encouraged” by early iPhone sales and impressed by the number of people who switched carriers to get Sprint’s iPhone specifically.Early indicators are important because Sprint needs to sell millions of iPhones to earn back a $15.5 billion commitment it made to Apple in exchange for access to the device. Since Sprint pays Apple around $600 per phone and their contract spans four years, the annual target is about 6 million iPhones.Despite its current momentum, the iPhone isn’t likely to edge out Sprint’s strong base of Android users for awhile. Asked about an analyst estimate that projected the iPhone would soon make up 50% of Sprint’s total smartphone sales, Hesse said the forecast was “a bit high.”

Nokia announced Friday that its chief executive will step down and will be replaced by a veteran from Microsoft, as the Finnish handset maker continues to look to create a smartphone that can compete with Apple's iPhone.Nokia announced in a press release Friday that Stephen Elop, who is currently head of Microsoft's Business Division, will become its new CEO on Sept. 21. Elop will replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, the current president and CEO, who has served as the company's head sine 2006. In that time, Kallasvuo and Nokia failed to develop a smartphone that could challenge Apple's iPhone, and have seen their market share slip , even though they remain the largest handset maker in the world. But while Nokia retains the lion's share of overall worldwide handset sales, it is dwarfed by Apple in terms of profit. In May, Kallasuvuo even publicly admitted that his company has failed to make a splash in the U.S. smartphone market, while Apple has taken the industry by storm with the iPhone and its digital storefront for third-party applications, the App Store. The company's best smartphones have struggled to compete in the high-end market with the likes of the iPhone and handsets based on Google's Android mobile operating system. "The time is right to accelerate the company's renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success," said Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors. "The Nokia board believes that Stephen has the right industry experience and leadership skills to realize the full potential of Nokia. His strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company." Though Kallasvuo will officially resign as president and CEO on Sept. 20, he will continue to chair the Board of Nokia Siemens Networks in a non-executive capacity. His severance package will net him 18 months of gross base salary and target incentive, totaling about 4.6 million euros. He will also be compensated for the 100,000 restricted shares of Nokia stock he was granted in 2007, which fully vest on Oct. 1, 2010. "The whole board of directors joins me in thanking Olli-Pekka for his thirty years at Nokia, during which he has been deeply involved in developing the company and its operations," Ollila said. "His dedication and contribution throughout the years has been exceptional. The board wishes him every success in his future pursuits." In addition to competing in the smartphone market, both Apple and Nokia are entrenched in a number of lawsuits related to patents. The first shot in the legal battle was fired by Nokia last October, when it accused Apple's iPhone of violating patents related to GSM and wireless LAN technology. It is believed that Nokia's losses in the market prompted the company to sue over the alleged use of 10 patented wireless standards in the iPhone. Apple responded to Nokia with its own lawsuit , accusing the Finnish company of infringing on 13 iPhone-related patents. The battle of the two smartphone giants is expected to drag out for years, with both companies looking for a court hearing to be held in 2012. The U.S. International Trade Commission -- the group with which the complaints were filed -- has agreed to look into both Nokia's and Apple's complaints against the other.

Now that AT&T has full control of wireless hotspots like Starbucks and Barnes and Nobles, it looks like they're doling out freebies to their favorite customers: iPhone users. Apparently, if you've got one of Apple's devices, you can hop on the WiFi networks for exactly zero dollars provided you enter your phone number at a login screen. Great for iPhone owners, but a raw deal for everyone else, right? Not so fast, apparently a dumb hack gets you the service on the house too -- just switch your browser's user agent to Mobile Safari, and presto! Free internet. We can't imagine this is a hole that won't get plugged real fast, so get it while the gettin's good.[Via TUAW Read - AT&T Providing Free Wi-Fi Access to iPhone Users Read - Hotspot hack

Seeing Han Solo emerge as a frozen block of carbonite was probably the hardest thing for me to come to terms with when I saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time -- I was young and Han is the man. That image will forever be burned into my skull and now another fellow frozen in carbonite has a place up there too. His name is Steve Jobs.That’s right, someone decided to take the Apple’s head honcho and freeze him in carbonite! No not really, it’s actually an iPhone case made of flexible plastic -- not carbonite -- and it doesn’t come with a real Steve Jobs. However, it is probably one of the coolest and most creative iPhone cases I have ever seen! The $35 price tag matches up pretty well other cases out there but, those other cases don’t come with your very own frozen prisoner so there really is no comparison. There were actually a few models; one for iPhone 4, 3G and 3GS and there were skins if you didn't want a hard case.Unfortunately, it looks like Apple wasn’t very happy about the whole deal and they have sent the creators a cease and desist, which is a total bummer but we definitely saw it coming. The cases have actually been on sale since March and with the all the attention something like this will gain it was only a matter of time before they had to stop. Sorry for getting your hopes up, but it was just too cool not to write about. We’ll let you know if anything official spurs from this as a Han Solo in carbonite case would have the same level awesomeness.Related Posts: Review: HBO's Game Of Thrones Episode 2: The Kingsroad The Force Is Strong With America's Best Dance Crew's 'Street Kingdom'Discuss this story in our Movies/TV forums!

The New YorkTimes is out with the second installment of its iEconomy series, which explores high-tech manufacturing in an era of globalization. Not surprisingly, Apple, America’s top technology company, is a central focus of the series. The first piece came out last weekend and described why so many consumer electronics — including Apple’s iPhone and iPad — are produced in Asia: it’s vastly cheaper than building them in the U.S. Although outsourcing and the consequent demise of the U.S. manufacturing sector is a perennially hot political issue, the economics of globalization suggest that U.S. jobs lost to cheaper overseas competition won’t be coming back.Thursday’s article focuses on working conditions at factories run by Apple’s Asian contractors, including Foxconn, which produces an estimated 40% of the world’s consumer electronics. It paints a grim picture and raises questions about the effectiveness of Apple’s supplier code of conduct, which sets standards for labor issue and safety protections. Apple says that when it discovers violations, it requires improvements. But the article suggests there are limits to Apple’s influence over the sprawling factories run by its contractors. And the company has even less impact on company plants that supply its contractors.(MORE: $100 Billion Question: What Should Apple Do with Its Cash?)So will we see some kind of movement to boycott Apple products, akin to the campaign several years ago to pressure Nike to improve working conditions in its factories? Seems unlikely at the moment. “You can either manufacture in comfortable, worker-friendly factories, or you can reinvent the product every year, and make it better and faster and cheaper, which requires factories that seem harsh by American standards,” an anonymous current Apple executive told the Times. “And right now, customers care more about a new iPhone than working conditions in China.”Among the highlights (or lowlights) of the article:Employees work excessive overtime, in some cases seven days a week, and live in crowded dorms. Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk. Underage workers have helped build Apple’s products, and the company’s suppliers have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records, according to company reports and advocacy groups that, within China, are often considered reliable, independent monitors.(MORE: Apple Reports Record Profits on Massive iPhone and iPad Sales)Several high-profile disasters have occurred at factories run by Apple contractors:Two years ago, 137 workers at an Apple supplier in eastern China were injured after they were ordered to use a poisonous chemical to clean iPhone screens. Within seven months last year, two explosions at iPad factories, including in Chengdu, killed four people and injured 77. Before those blasts, Apple had been alerted to hazardous conditions inside the Chengdu plant, according to a Chinese group that published that warning.One former Foxconn manager offered a scathing assessment of Apple priorities:“Apple never cared about anything other than increasing product quality and decreasing production cost,” said Li Mingqi, who until April worked in management at Foxconn Technology, one of Apple’s most important manufacturing partners. Mr. Li, who is suing Foxconn over his dismissal, helped manage the Chengdu factory where the explosion occurred. “Workers’ welfare has nothing to do with their interests,” he said.“We’ve known about labor abuses in some factories for four years, and they’re still going on,” said one former Apple executive who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. “Why? Because the system works for us. Suppliers would change everything tomorrow if Apple told them they didn’t have another choice.” “If half of iPhones were malfunctioning, do you think Apple would let it go on for four years?” the executive asked.Apple declined to comment for the story. It will be interesting to see if this series spurs consumers to put any pressure on Apple to do more to improve conditions in its supplier factories.

I was stunned last night watching the evening news. Ögmundur Jónasson, the Minister of the Interior, screaming at Obama in front of the American embassy.Ögmundur was screaming loud and clear but Obama could hardly hear him. He is in Myanmar trying to speed up the democratic process where the military junta has had an iron grip on its people for more than thirty years.Ögmundur was right, it is terrible that 80 people lost their lives (according to updated figures, 110 Palestinians) in the Gaza Strip in just five days.But Ögmundur was wrong to support Hamas, the governing political party in Gaza.Yes, it is terrible that so many people have lost their lives but he did not mention the 40,000 people who have died in the last 18 months next door in Syria. Or the regime in Iran, the main supporters of weapons and money to Hamas.Hamas have been provoking Israel for a long time, shooting missiles all the way to Tel-Aviv. Just yesterday, up to 500 missiles were reportedly launched.Why... their support has been losing ground in Gaza. They know if they would allow free elections, they would lose. People want peace. So the easiest way to stay in power is not to allow free elections and to shoot Iranian made missiles towards Israel. They are trying to win the support of the people in Gaza again by showing they are the strong guys standing up against Israel.At a terrible cost to the local population.But if Ögmundur is sincere he should look at Syria. The situations there gets worse by the day.And there is a real danger of genocide when Bashar al-Assad’s government loses its hopeless battle.Millions could be killed in ethnic cleansing when the war is over with the Alawis, Christians and Druze making up almost one quarter of the population.In the back seat, the Government of Iran.

Following a report from earlier this month that claimed Apple’s (AAPL) next-generation iPhone will launch in the first half of 2013, new claims have emerged from the Far East that further support a summertime launch for Apple’s next iPhone. Digitimes cites unnamed market observers in stating that a number of Apple’s component suppliers are looking forward to strong first-quarter performance ahead of two big product launches slated to take place by mid-2013.The first, Apple’s next iPad, would be pretty surprising considering the November 2012 launch of Apple’s fourth-generation iPad model. The second, which would be just as surprising considering Apple’s recent shift to an annual fall launch timeframe, is a new iPhone.Digitimes provides no details surrounding the fifth-generation iPad or seventh-generation iPhone, but earlier reports claimed Apple’s manufacturing partners have already begun trial production of the next iPhone in an effort to avoid the yield issues that have plagued Apple’s previous iPhone launches.

Android devices have outsold that of Apple iOS4 handsets for the first time on record in the U.S., according to a Nielson survey. Worldwide, Android is a force too — up 886 percent from a year ago. Nokia is still the king, but for how long?Sales of Google Android phones in the U.S. are rising so quickly, the devices have outsold Apple handsets for the first time on record. New smartphone subscribers choosing Google phones accounted for 27 percent of U.S. smartphone sales, the Nielsen Company will announce this morning, nudging past the 23 percent share held by Apple. But Android isn’t just a U.S. phenomenon: Canalys today estimates that Android handset sales grew 886 percent worldwide from the year ago quarter.It’s easier to show stellar growth in the beginning of  a product cycle, but Android is nearly two years old. One could make the valid argument that Android really began to mature over the past year with Android 2.1, so from that standpoint, Google’s platform is still an infant when compared to iOS4, BlackBerry and other mobile operating systems. But the uptake of Android among handset-makers is another factor in such growth. Motorola’s Mobile Device division has swung from losses to profits on the back of Android, for example. And HTC — once primarily a Windows Mobile phone maker — embraced Android even as Microsoft’s mobile platform is undergoing a major facelift. The result? HTC revenues were up 66 percent in June from a year ago.As hot a seller as Google Android phones are right now, its user base isn’t the most satisfied with their device. When surveying current Android device owners, Nielson found that 71 percent would buy an Android phone again. That sounds like a high loyalty rating, but it falls noticeably short when asking iPhone owners about their next handset — 89 percent are happy with iOS4 and plan to buy a future Apple handset.Both the Android and iOS4 platforms still trail the 33 percent U.S. share held by Research in Motion’s BlackBerry devices, but for many, BlackBerry needs an overhaul. One half of the current BlackBerry owners surveyed don’t want another RIM device when it comes time to upgrade, but instead are looking at replacements running either Google’s or Apple’s mobile platform. Even with the top market share spot in the U.S., RIM share has been trending down because the current devices are seen as inferior when it comes to browsing or offering apps. That should change tomorrow as RIM is holding a press event where it is widely expected the company will debut its new BlackBerry 6 operating system and potentially new devices, such as a tablet.Given that the U.S. currently has the largest smartphone user base — Canalys estimates 14.7 million smartphones were purchased in the U.S. last quarter — it’s easy to overlook the current king of smartphone sales globally: Nokia. In the second quarter of 2010, the Finnish phone-maker sold 23.8 million handsets. Nokia saw a 41 percent growth rate over the prior year’s second quarter sales, which sounds positive, but when compared to Android’s 886 percent gain, Nokia’s growth pales in comparison. The overall smartphone market is growing, which is lifting sales of nearly all. But some — like Android — are clearly growing far faster than others.Why RIMs Future (Unfortunately) Hinges on BlackBerry OS 6

You may find it hard to believe, but it’s possible to capture 3D scans with your iPhone using just the screen and the camera. The solution comes in the form of an app called Trimensional.The way in which it works is very simple, but the results are quite effective as the video above and images below show.In order to work you need to turn the brightness right up on your iPhone display, then stand in complete darkness. Hold the phone screen up to your face (around 20cm away) with the Trimensional app loaded, and tell it to starts scanning.The end result is a 3D scan of your face with the quality depending on how dark you managed to get the environment you are standing in.Here’s the full feature list of the first version of the app:For $0.99 on the App Store it gives you a new way to capture images of yourself, friends, or random objects which you can then share with others over e-mail, or manipulate them directly on your phone.The Trimensional website states it works best with iPhone 4 or the latest generation (4th) iPod touch. So if you have a previous generation phone or iPod check the iTunes comments first to see if anyone got it working.One update we’d like to see to the app is the ability to export the 3D model in a standard format 3D art packages can handle.Read more at the Trimensional website

Materials in the low-end model of Apple Inc.'s /quotes/zigman/68270/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.85% new iPhone 5 cost $199, according to a physical teardown by market-research provider IHS Inc. /quotes/zigman/368690/quotes/nls/ihs IHS -0.75% .Meanwhile, the 16-gigabyte iPhone 5 cost $207 to manufacture, the firm said.Earlier this month, the firm's virtual teardown estimated the combined cost of the components for the iPhone 5--what is known as a bill of materials--at $197, or only $9 more than for the iPhone 4S.The iPhone 5 is Apple's first smartphone to work on high-speed fourth-generation cellular networks, using the Long-Term Evolution, or LTE, technological standard. The consumer price of the base model iPhone 5 is the same as for the 4S.IHS said the bill for parts in the 32-gigabyte version increased to $209.00, pushing the total manufacturing cost to $230."The iPhone 5 exhibits a great deal of similarity to the iPhone 4S in terms of component suppliers," said Andrew Rassweiler, senior principal analyst of teardown services for IHS. "But beyond this superficial resemblance, there are some critical changes to product design and parts that enable major upgrades that improve user experience."These changes include a faster applications processor, larger display and a high-speed 4G LTE air interface, the firm said.New suppliers for the iPhone 5 include SanDisk Corp. /quotes/zigman/54370/quotes/nls/sndk SNDK -1.17% , which contributed the NAND flash memory. The firm said this is first time that SanDisk NAND has been found in an iPhone examined by IHS. The firm's iPhone 4S teardown showed the NAND supplier was Samsung Electronics Co. (SSNHY, 005930.SE).However, IHS said Samsung, SK Hynix Inc. (HXSCF, 000660.SE) and Toshiba Corp. (TOSYY, 6502.TO) could also serve as Apple's sources because the NAND component is a commodity part available from multiple suppliers.Elpida Memory Inc. replaced Samsung as the supplier of the SDRAM in the iPhone 5 analyzed by IHS. But IHS said Samsung and Hynix could also be supplying this widely available memory part.

Sprint has been something of an underdog in the U.S. wireless space for years now, and while the iPhone has absolutely changed the course of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, it has only recently started to ship on Sprint . The first change Sprint had to grab the iPhone came at the iPhone 4S event in October 2010, and while the real numbers are murky, it's estimated that Sprint invested billions over a number of years to make that deal happen. That's a lot of scratch for a carrier that is struggling to maintain a user base, and shareholders are finally speaking up about it. According to Reuters, Sprint's CEO Dan Hesse has agreed to a pay cut after "coming under fire from some shareholders disappointed with the hit the company's results took from subsidizing Apple's popular iPhones." Hesse has said that his salary will be cut in order to repay around $346,000 in incentive pay that he has already received, and he'll also give up additional amounts that was previously eligible for. Here's Hesse's statement: "These voluntary actions regarding my personal compensation, which total $3,250,830, will eliminate any benefit for me to the discretionary adjustment the compensation committee made earlier this year." Yeah, that's a lot of money, but the move will still put him at a salary level nearly in line with 2010 levels, and Sprint still has a long way to go before that $15 billion bet on the iPhone proves worthwhile.

Android Shakes Up U.S. Smartphone Market First quarter 2010 information from The NPD Group's Mobile Phone Track reveals a shift in the smartphone market, as Android OS edged out Apple's OS for the number-two position behind RIM PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Android operating system (OS) continued to shake up the U.S. mobile phone market in the first quarter (Q1) of 2010, moving past Apple to take the number-two position among smartphone operating systems, according to The NPD Group, a leading market research company. NPD's wireless market research reveals that based on unit sales to consumers last quarter the Android operating system moved into second position at 28 percent behind RIM's OS (36 percent) and ahead of Apple's OS (21 percent). "As in the past, carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role in determining smartphone market share" "As in the past, carrier distribution and promotion have played a crucial role in determining smartphone market share," said Ross Rubin, executive director of industry analysis for NPD. "In order to compete with the iPhone, Verizon Wireless has expanded its buy-one-get-one offer beyond RIM devices to now include all of their smartphones." Strong sales of the Droid, Droid Eris, and Blackberry Curve via these promotions helped keep Verizon Wireless's smartphone sales on par with AT&T in Q1. According to NPD's Mobile Phone Track, smartphone sales at AT&T comprised nearly a third of the entire smartphone market (32 percent), followed by Verizon Wireless (30 percent), T-Mobile (17 percent) and Sprint (15 percent). "Recent previews of BlackBerry 6, the recently announced acquisition of Palm by HP, and the pending release of Windows Phone 7 demonstrates the industry's willingness to make investments to address consumer demand for smartphones and other mobile devices," Rubin said. "Carriers continue to offer attractive pricing for devices, but will need to present other data-plan options to attract more customers in the future." The continued popularity of messaging phones and smartphones resulted in slightly higher prices for all mobile phones, despite an overall drop in the number of mobile phones purchased in the first quarter. The average selling price for all mobile phones in Q1 reached $88, which is a 5 percent increase from Q1 2009. Smartphone unit prices, by comparison, averaged $151 in Q1 2010, which is a 3 percent decrease over the previous year. Methodology: The NPD Group compiles and analyzes mobile device sales data based on more than 150,000 completed online consumer research surveys each month. Surveys are based on a nationally balanced and demographically-representative sample, and results are projected to represent the entire population of U.S. consumers.

AT&T, O2 feels your pain. Like AT&T, the U.K. mobile services provider has seen its network overtaxed by Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone, particularly in London, where a massive surge in data traffic has been causing network congestion since summer.In an interview with the Financial Times, O2 CEO Ronan Dunne said the company has seen an 18-fold increase in data traffic since the beginning of the year, most of it driven by super-smartphones like the iPhone. “Where we haven’t met our own high standards then there’s no question, we apologise to customers for that fact,” Dunne said. “But it would be wrong to say O2 has failed its customers en masse.”Well, that’s one way of looking at it. The thousands of smartphone users who lost data service just a few days ago might see things a bit differently, though. Anyway, O2–like AT&T in the U.S.–is doing its best to contain the public relations damage arising from such outages. Dunne says the carrier has added an additional 200 mobile base stations in London to help it meet data demand and has been working with its infrastructure suppliers on network tweaks to improve data service.Wise moves. Best to act quickly and get out ahead of issues like these, which can become PR nightmares very quickly. As AT&T recently learned, network congestion issues make great fodder for the advertising campaigns of rivals. Wouldn’t want Vodafone (VOD) running its own version of Verizon’s (VZ) nasty “There’s a Map for That” commercials, now would we?

I'm writing to share a pretty surprising discovery--the iPhone 3GS shares the same reception issues as the iPhone 4. If the 3GS is held in exactly the same manner as the iPhone 4, the number of bars will move from 5 to no reception. I noticed this for the first time today when I removed my case and decided to hold it in the "improper" way. It seems that the reception issue has always been an issue and this allegedly "new" problem has been manufactured into a crisis. I've been a very happy owner of the 3GS for over a year and have not experienced any difficulties whatsoever--admittedly, probably because it was in a protective case.If this has always been an issue, I guess the next question becomes: To what extent have issues associated with AT&T been conflated with iPhone 3GS hardware/software issues?

Whenever you hear about bugs and exploits being discovered in the iPhone’s browser, Safari, it’s usually the doings of some masterful meddler who devoted hours to unearthing any flaws they could find — not some user casually tapping around the application. Apple’s pretty good at keeping things locked down, and the iPhone’s got enough users that most of the nasty user-facing bugs have been flushed out. Well, except for this new one.It’s not an incredibly common bug, and it doesn’t seem likely that it would hit most users – but for the iPhone users this newly discovered bug does affect, it could mean huge operator fees.The flaw, as discovered by Estonian Apple Site AppleSpot: If the user visits a site which uses Motion-JPEG (most commonly used for security cams and live feeds) in Safari, Safari will continue to gobble up bandwidth even after Safari is closed. Safari is one of the few apps that Apple allows to process in the background, and Motion-JPEG streams appear to continue streaming, even if the stream is in another tab or in the “closed” application. Apple gives no indication that Safari will continue to stream – and considering that most applications on the platform aren’t granted such privileges, it’s unlikely that a lay user would understand the consequences.As mentioned, this bug certainly isn’t one that springs up all that regularly; for it to affect you, you need to not only visit one of these Motion-JPEG streams in Safari, but also be on some sort of pay-per-megabyte plan. While it’s no sweat off the backs of anyone on an unlimited package (as is the case with a vast majority of US iPhone users), it could work out to MASSIVE wallet damage for anyone traveling internationally or who are signed up on carriers that only offer metered data.The original discoverers of the bug claim to have been able to rack up over 740 megabytes in silently streamed data during one hour of testing. If the same thing had happened to someone without a data package, they say that one hour of unintentional data usage would have worked out to roughly 30,000 Estonian kroons in fees – or just shy of $3,000 dollars. Ouch.

All we can say to Adrian Chen is: thanks for taking a bullet for the rest of us.Let's hope this won't become a regular demand before sources agree to speak with writers, but it did make for quite the sight as the tech world returned from the long Labor Day weekend: Gawker's Adrian Chen published a picture of himself today resplendent in a a pink tutu with a shoe on his head after the shadowy group declared in a note left on the hacker document-sharing site Pastebin the following:to journalists: no more interviews to anyone till Adrian Chen get featured in the front page of Gawker, a whole day, with a huge picture of him dressing a ballet tutu and shoe on the head, no photoshop. yeah, man. like Keith Alexander. go, go, go. (and there you ll get your desired pageviews number too) Until that happens, this whole statement will be the only thing getting out directly from us. So no tutu, no sources.The demand came as an online hacker group associated with Anonymous claimed to have posted 1 million Apple Unique Device Identifiers after breaching FBI security. So far, Chen reports, he hasn't heard back from Anonymous.

Microsoft's Office for iPad, iPhone, and Android is a reality. Although Office Mobile has been rumored and reportedly spotted in the wild, Microsoft has remained persistently quiet about its plans for the product. The Verge has learned through several sources close to Microsoft's plans that the company will release Office versions for Android and iOS in early 2013.Office Mobile will debut in the form of free apps that allow Android and iOS users to view Microsoft Office documents on the move. Like the existing SkyDrive and OneNote apps, Office Mobile will require a Microsoft account. On first launch, a Microsoft account will provide access to the basic viewing functionality in the apps. Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents will all be supported, and edit functionality can be enabled with an Office 365 subscription.Microsoft will allow iOS users to purchase an Office 365 subscription within the app, or let organizations distribute codes to enable Office Mobile editing for users. The apps will allow for basic editing, but we're told this won't go very far in attempting to replace regular full use of a desktop Office version.A recent Microsoft press release from the company's Czech Republic subsidiary revealed that Office Mobile apps for Android and iOS would be made available from March 2013. We understand that Office Mobile for iOS will arrive first in late February or early March, with an Android version due in May.We reached out to Microsoft for comment on this story and a company spokesperson says "Office will work across Windows Phone, iOS and Android."

At this point, it's clear that the $99 iPhone 3G rumor was just that: rumor. We have a letter that we believe to be authentic from a source within Walmart that says the iPhone will launch in the house that Sam built at 9am December 28th. At launch, only the 8GB ($197) and 16GB ($297) iPhone 3Gs will be available with a required signature on a 2-year AT&T contract. An internal pilot program kicks off today at 488 stores across the nation. The iPhone 3G and a sack of garden manure all under the same roof... heaven.

UPDATE: I have run out of promo codes, but really appreciate all the positive comments and support. If you have feedback, please feel free to email me at jacobu@gmail.com. I can only do some much QA testing on my own, and it's not until something gets into the hands of the masses that it can truly be torn apart :-D. I'll do my best to reply to all your messages and fix anything that needs fixing. I will release a bug fix version within a few days (+approval time, ~2-3 days), and will likely give out more free copies then. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.So for the last 2 months, I've been cranking away on an app called Aetherspark. It's a file browser, storage, and transfer system. It lets you mount your iPad as a disk from any OS (via WebDAV), transfer files to it, and browse them on the device. You can also upload and browse files on your device with a web browser. It even lets you send files between devices (even without wifi). Yes, it's a bit like AirSharing, but the interface is significantly different, and it has file transfer capabilities. It's also cheaper.Here are some demo videos Here's the app store linkI have 50 promo codes (most I can get per version) that I want to give out for a free download, so if you want one, please send me a private message and I'll give you one (if I haven't run out).I'm not only looking to get the word out about it, I'm also looking for feedback (both suggestions and problems you have with it).A slight caveat, the promo codes only work in the U.S. iTunes store. Nothing I can do about this unfortunately. :-(

Wow! After bleeding customers for a long time finally seem to be adding them.I wonder if this blip has to do with Sprint still offering unlimited data? AT&T/Verizon, take note. ugh, don't think so. They might have added 1.8 iphones but remove the ones who were stupid enough to dump their plan/phone and crossover to the apple side. What they don't REALLY show is the number of current customers who switched. Then take away the ones, like me, who have terminated 2 of his 6 lines of service and moved to someone else (the other 4 are soon to follow). I'm sure that 1.8 mil would be more like 200k lines added. Sprint has fallen into the same marketing hype that the other 2 have. They don't offer REAL unlimited. Download a few gigs of streams and you'll see just how unlimited they are.iPhone sales helped Sprint boost its number of subscribers by 1.6 million in the quarter to 55 million. The total is highest in Sprint?s history, the company said.Sprint?s net new customer growth included 161,000 under 2-year contracts, 507,000 buying service month to month and 954,000 buying service on Sprint?s network through affiliated companies and wholesale vendors.Revenues rose to $8.72 billion in the quarter, up more than 5 percent from a year ago. So it seems iPhone prevented people leaving for the most part, not add a lot of new post-pay subscribers. Their first goal was to stop the bleeding with iPhone, which they have done. Now they need to get the new network rolled out, keep it unlimited and then they may be able to steal more customers from others.Uh... Karl's own summary clearly states 40% of those iPhone customers were new to Sprint's network.Sprint should have never put their eggs in one basket. They could have deployed the Wimax network on their own like they started to but decided to spin off and put their money into another company.now they're trying to rebound by spending their cash reserves on the iPhone and are still trying to build another network. without $$$ and a failing credit score; one or both is going to have to give.And Sprint will only stay around if they can get the $$ they need and I don't see that coming from the cable partners on the Clear side. You realize Sprint will rake in massive profits from all those iPhone users every month, right?The wireless market is extremely uncompetitive. The margins are huge. Sprint will be fine.They should have focused on building a good network, and wholesale and prepaid, where they are competitive. They are doing a $5B network upgrade and extending CDMA/LTE to 800Mhz to give more distance/penetration. What more could you ask for? Thats something that should have been done long ago. Its too almost too late to even worry about CDMA when everything is moving to VoLTE next year... LTE hasn't even been approved on the SMR band either so LTE isn't being rolled out on those frequencies any time soon.Using 800 as a crutch to not have to build more towers isn't going to magically expand their network either, they still need to do a lot more than they plan on doing if they want to stay competitive. Right now they really don't offer a significant value over the *other* carriers, especially when it comes to 4G data.

With portable navigation systems hanging from millions of windshields and the price point of the popular devices diving down to the $99 mark, automakers’ expensive in-dash nav systems are going the way of the car phone. But with mobile-phone based navigation gaining ground — and the new 3-G iPhone expected to debut on Monday with full GPS capability — portable navs could soon face a similar fate.Phone-based GPS navigation has been steadily gaining ground on portables. Earlier this week, Networks in Motion, the leading provider of navigation services to the top four U.S. cellular carriers, announced that the day before Mother’s Day, May 10, saw the largest spike ever in the use of navigation on mobile phones, with nearly 5 million requests.That’s a lot of drivers finding their way to mom’s house. And looking at a small screen while driving.Portable navigation has experienced phenomenal growth over the past several years, while automakers’ expensive in-dash systems have been shown to increase the depreciation of a vehicle. But the use of GPS-enabled mobile phones isexpected to quadruple by 2011, and if GPS is introduced on the new iPhone, as expected, it could accelerate the shift away from portable nav systems. And as Popular Mechanics reported, leave GPS suppliers "scared %#*@-less." Portable nav heavyweight Garmin already introduced an iPhone-like GPS phone earlier this year, and last week minor player Mio unveiled two similar GPS phones. Now, all eyes will be on Steve Jobs on Monday when the Apple Godhead is expected to unveil the iPhone 2.0 with built-in GPS at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.The market is ripe for it. Networks in Motion, which claims to have a 57 percent share of U.S. revenue from navigation services offered on mobile phones, says that in early in 2007 it had less than a million paid users. Now it has more than 3 million, and in May it reached the milestone of more than 100 million monthly navigation requests.But the biggest challenge will be how to deal with driver distraction issues in moving from the small screen of portable navs to the even smaller screen of mobile phones.Let’s see if Apple will show the way.

This was my attempt to find out how good the camera on the new iPhone4 really is. All the pictures and video clips are straight out of the camera and are not retouched. The video was put together on the phone using the iMovie app.Overall, I'm prepared to ditch my point-and-shoot (not my DSLR of course) since this is a great camera for daytime photography. (The low light and flash performance are nothing to write home about though, but the great video quality, ease of use and the availability of the iMovie app more than make up for the deficiencies).

Once the best of friends, Google and Apple have been warring for months now. First there was Apple's rejection of Google Voice from the App Store, which was soon followed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt stepping down from Apple's board of directors. And then let's not forget about Google positioning its Android OS to challenge the iPhone, Steve Jobs calling Google's "Don't be Evil" mantra bs, and of course, Apple indirectly going after Android by suing HTC for patent infringement.All in all, while Apple and Google still work closely on some initiatives, a new wrinkle in their relationship appears to manifest itself every couple of weeks. And now we have yet another example on our hands.The word "Google" is so ingrained as part of our everyday lexicon that it's now referenced as a verb more so than anything else - i.e "Did you Google it?" In fact, Google is so synonymous with 'Search' that in the current version of mobile Safari, where Google is the default search engine, users press a "Google" button after they've typed in their web query.  But those days appear long gone.In the new iPhone OS 4, the "Google" button has been replaced by a more generic "Search" button. Does this mean that Apple is indeed considering a deal with Microsoft whereby Bing would become the default search engine on the iPhone? Or maybe it's simply an indication that Apple doesn't want to give Google free branding promotion on the iPhone, even if it happens to be the default search engine.I, for one, hope Apple's hyper-competiveness regarding the iPhone and Android doesn't cloud their judgement to the extent that Bing becomes the default search engine on the iPhone. While Microsoft has certainly made some strides with their search engine offering, it simply can't compete with Google. At least not yet, anyways. The iPhone is all about quality, and it seems a bit backwards to push Google search aside when it's clearly the highest quality search engine available. While Google search would still be available as an option in a Bing/iPhone world, why make users wade into the system preferences to begin with?

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) office, part of the Department of Homeland Security, recently revealed that it will be adopting iOS devices from a variety of service providers for its 17,676 users. It’s a win for Apple in terms of landing a sizeable government client, but also a significant vote of confidence for the overall security of iOS as a mobile platform, given the nature of the agency in question.Here’s how a justification filing posted to the official Federal Business Opportunities government website describes the usage of these iPhones:Part of the justification for the switch (which moves ICE off of BlackBerry devices from the beleaguered RIM, by the way), includes making sure that the product of choice has plenty of market share and “interest by third-party vendors to spur innovation and utility.” It also requires strict OS modification detection standards to allow for the proper identification of potential security threats, and application signatures for custom apps installed by the agency itself.This also opens the door for iPad use, given the language used in the document. Apple’s been gaining ground among government agencies. Last February for instance, the U.S. General Services Administration began issuing iPhones, as well as Android devices, to some government workers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also announced a decision to use iPhone and iPad earlier this year, dropping support for BlackBerry devices after May 12, and the ATF announced a similar move shortly thereafter.Apple has steadily been improving its mobile platform security features with every iOS release, and it appears that those changes are helping the company continue to attract interest from large organizations with data sensitivity concerns. In fact, one of the core security features introduced in iOS 6, Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization, provides significant advantages for those concerned about potential malware infection. Intego’s Mac security blog explains:This means it will take a whole lot more skill and effort to come up with a jailbreak that works for iOS 6 (whether you consider that a good or a bad thing), and it also means it’ll be harder for malware authors to sneak onto non-jailbroken machines.Apple winning away government and enterprise share from incumbent RIM is a great way the company can build up a solid base immune to any changing fortunes between iOS and Android on the consumer side. It’ll be interesting to see how this trend is affected by the introduction of a lower-cost, smaller iOS tablet, if that is indeed something we see at tomorrow’s event.

Denied the opportunity to make the argument in court that the design of the original iPhone was derived from Sony concepts, Samsung has decided to make it in the court of public opinion. Moments ago, the company released to the media two batches of evidence excluded from the trial currently occuring in San Jose, Calif., along with the following statement:The Judge’s exclusion of evidence on independent creation meant that even though Apple was allowed to inaccurately argue to the jury that the F700 was an iPhone copy, Samsung was not allowed to tell the jury the full story and show the pre-iPhone design for that and other phones that were in development at Samsung in 2006, before the iPhone. The excluded evidence would have established beyond doubt that Samsung did not copy the iPhone design. Fundamental fairness requires that the jury decide the case based on all the evidence.A brazen statement, particularly the last line which seems to express hope that members of the jury will see the excluded evidence. But evidently Samsung’s legal team is not at all happy with the way the trial has progressed so far.Ahead of opening arguments on Monday, Samsung lawyer John Quinn asked the court to hear further arguments and allow evidence showing that Samsung designs for what became the P700 predate the iPhone. Judge Lucy Koh denied the request, saying that she had already heard three motions to reconsider the point and noting once again that the evidence had been excluded for good reason: it was introduced far too late in the discovery process.Quinn persisted, saying he was begging the court to hear more discussion, something he said he hadn’t done in his 30-plus years of law.“You’ve made your record for appeal,” Koh said. “Don’t make me sanction you, please.”Update: Apple’s legal team was quick to take issue with Samsung’s release of evidence excluded from the trial, saying the action was contemptible. Judge Koh was none too pleased with the move herself, calling for an immediate meeting with Quinn.“Tell Mr. Quinn I’d like to see him today,” Koh said. “I want to know who drafted the press release, who authorized it from the legal team.”

The Wall Street Journal reports (subscription required) that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has opened an inquiry into Apple's rejection of an official Google Voice application for the iPhone as well as the removal of numerous third-party applications offering Google Voice functionality. In particular, the FCC is interested in AT&T's role in the decision-making process.In letters sent late Friday to the three companies, the FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related "third-party applications" from its store. The letter also seeks information on how AT&T was consulted in the decision, if at all.Apple and AT&T declined to comment on the inquiry, while Google representatives have not yet responded to requests for comments. The inquiry, which is apparently part of broader investigations by the FCC and the Department of Justice of possible anti-competitive practices in the wireless industry primarily targeting AT&T and Verizon, was reportedly initiated by the FCC on its own and not prompted by any specific complaint to the agency. Earlier today, Bloomberg reported that the FCC is also taking a close look at rural wireless markets that have no or limited coverage from the major wireless providers to determine how handset exclusivity agreements with those providers are unfairly hindering competition from the smaller carriers that service the rural markets.

For some time now, rumors of the GPhone (or Google phone) have been circulating around the web.  While it didn't make a whole lot of sense that Google was going to get into the hardware business, especially the highly competitive handset business, it seemed reasonable that Google had an interest in the handheld market for obvious reasons, not the least of which is the huge potential in search.  Though, as we came to find out, it wasn't so much the hardware but the "platform" that Google was interested in.  Tomorrow (9/23) will bring a lot more clarity to Google's play in the handset business, according to Time , as the first ever Google Andriod operating system-based handset is set for retail availability with T-Mobile customers.  The T-Mobile Dream is go for launch.The sweetest part of the Dream is the Android Market — Google's answer to the Apple App Store. Whereas many Apple apps cost money (typically anywhere from $.99 to $9.99), at launch all Android Market apps will be free. That includes BreadCrumbz, a picture-based navigation program that doesn't just give you a drawing of your route, but also includes real-world photos to keep you on track. Another interesting app, TuneWiki, is a tricked-out music player that encourages mobile karaoke, by synchronizing written lyrics onscreen to the song's YouTube video.Let's see, open source, major player support in key enabling technologies like search and navigation, freeware utilities to the public --  Apple, you can be afraid now, very afraid.This video of the Android concept was published a little less than a year ago and it's still pretty impressive.  Now if they could just find a real service carrier, we'd be in business.

Among professional app developers, App Annie is often cited as one of the most reliable sources of market statistics. App Annie’s most recent info dump is a fascinating snapshot of the state of the industry on the eve of the next-generation iPhone launch.The autumn numbers following the sixth-generation iPhone launch are going to be extremely interesting to see. The global app market hangs in balance. Apple and Google growth rates in the U.S. are very close, Google holds the edge in Europe and LatAm, and Apple is on a tear in Asia.

It's all kicking off: Apple has called an emergency press conference to address the controversy surrounding the iPhone 4 and its incredible shrinking phone signal.iPhone 4 has been plagued with controversy since it first arrived in customers' hands, and owners quickly discovered those very hands broke their new £500 phone. It may be the dog and bone everyone and their gran has heard of, tweeted about, and featured in a hilarious webcomic, but it divides opinion like few other tech products -- and has even led to a share price nosedive.Apple's official stance is that the reception issues are the result of a long-standing software glitch that displays the wrong number of signal bars. So far, Apple has refused to acknowledge the alleged hardware problems caused by wrapping the phone's two antennas around the outside of the phone.Fortunately, someone has seen the funny side: Microsoft COO Kevin Turner joked at the MS Worldwide Partner Conference that "the iPhone 4 might be their Vista". The wag! Wasn't so blinkin' funny in 2005, Kev.If you aresuffering an iPhone 4 signal catastrophe, Crave is here to help: we show you how to fix your iBlower with our patented CNET UK iPhone 4 super-reception stick. We've also rounded up a selection of our favourite iPhone 4 cases.So what will Apple announce? Look no further than Crave, as we'll be closely following the press conference. It all kicks off tomorrow, Friday 16 July 2010, at 5pm BST, as if we've got nothing better to do on a Friday night.Will Steve Jobs announce a recall? Will Gray Powell's head be served up on an iPad? Will there be free bumpers for everyone? Or will El Steve be slowly wheeled across the stage in a wheelbarrow full of money, impassively flicking the Vs?Tell us your predictions in the comments, or on our official Facebook page.

the dreaded words 'No Service' plague my iPhone's (beautiful) screen.i decide to take the SIM card out and place it into my eight-year-old Nokia 6100. i turn it on. and now i see 'O2 - UK' and a full 7 bars! i place a call. i hear it ringing. my friend answers. we have our chat. all is well. i hang up and, apart from the handset getting slightly warm, i'm happy.i don't know about you but I want my phone to be able to place calls first and foremost. everything else is secondary.so is my phone faulty or has technology really gone backwards at Apple? how would I convince them to give me a new phone or a refund? your thoughts would be appreciated.EDIT: I have tried switching 3G both on and off. I leave things like Push, Wifi, Bluetooth, Notifications, etc all off. I find it has bad reception generally whenever I go indoors and, even when I leave a building or come out of the underground, it takes a while for it to find a signal.

BEIJING (AP) — Foxconn Technology Group denied on Saturday that production was affected at a Chinese factory that makes Apple’s iPhones, although both state media and an overseas labor watch group said some workers halted production lines on Friday, apparently over higher quality control standards.China Labor Watch, based in New York, reported that 3,000 to 4,000 workers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou in central China went on strike Friday over increased quality control demands and having to work during an extended national holiday.The state news agency Xinhua, quoting a spokesman for the management committee of the Xinzheng Comprehensive Bonded Area where the plant is, said some production lines were halted Friday when workers persuaded quality inspectors to skip work to show dissatisfaction over higher quality standards.In a statement on Saturday, Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, said production at the Zhengzhou plant continued without interruption. It denied any strike or work stoppage.Foxconn said there were two isolated, small-scale disputes between production line workers and quality assurance personnel on Monday and Tuesday.Xinhua said some workers were unhappy when Apple strengthened quality inspections of the iPhone 5 after consumer complaints regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone. In the Xinhua report, the spokesman was unable to provide a specific number of workers involved.

About 3-6 months before the iPhone debuted I received a Nokia N800 web tablet as part of the company's blogger relations program. I loved the device. It was one of the most powerful gadgets per pound and square inch I had ever used. I marveled at it.Nokia N800It wasn't the easiest device in the world to use but it had an internal camera which rotated allowing you to use the tablet to videoconference or take photos of your surroundings. It also supported Flash which the iPhone still doesn't.Other journalists and bloggers were blown away by the gadget as well.Then later an N810 device was released which supported WiMAX and had a keyboard built-in.But recently there have been reports which discuss the fact that Nokia is discontinuing the device. One article is from Evan Koblentz who used to work in TMC labs but now WirelessWeek, while another is from Michelle Robert who currently works for TMC. There is also excellent analysis from Greg Galitzine a senior TMCnet editor.Nokia N810 While I read the news I inquired with Nokia about the status of the device and received the following statement from Molly Schonthal at the company:The Nokia N810 WiMAX Edition has reached the expected end of its lifecycle. We will continue to follow the WiMAX network development and new product development decisions will be considered based on the evolution of the business.Any company that sells products doesn't discontinue them if they are profitable. The interesting takeaway here is that if Nokia is still selling the N800 - which it seems to be doing, the incremental cost of making the N810 has to be insignificant. This is the case as long as they are selling some of these units.We have to surmise that virtually none of these devices were selling. This leads us to wonder about WiMAX. Nokia is smart enough to continue investing in a market if it sees the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Did the economy coupled with LTE kill this pot of gold?You may be aware my company TMC has partnered with Carl Ford and the team over at CrossFire Media to put on a 4G event called 4G Wireless Evolution (4GWE) in less than a month in Miami. At this conference we will be discussing the ramifications of the world's largest mobile phone company pulling out of WiMAX. How significant is this development to carriers looking to deploy WiMAX?Does this news mean there needs to be an increased focus on LTE by the entire wireless market? What about the WiMAX equipment providers? Will they make it through a financial storm if the devices aren't there to support them?Remember that Richard Lowe who heads up Nortel's Carrier Networks pretty much blames the lack of devices for lost sales in the wireless space. If there are few WiMAX devices, why would consumers even consider the technology for mobile solutions when they are getting comfortable with 3G-enabled (soon 4G) devices which give them tremendous computing power in the palms of their hands?This two sentence statement by Nokia is worth a trillion dollars of investment in frequencies and equipment. This really changes everything. And it is worth further discussion and analysis.I truly hope you will be at the 4GWE show with us Feb 2-4, 2009 in Miami before you spend another dime on your future wireless networks. Likewise for investors and equipment manufacturers. In this economic environment you need a clear read on where things are going and 4GWE is the one event which will help answer your questions.

Recently reunited German electro-punk spazzes Atari Teenage Riot are still causing controversy. ATR's iPhone app has been delayed by the German iTunes store due to a dispute over its content. The free app is set to feature every ATR album, song, and video, as well as photos, news updates, and more. But it also included something called "Riotsounds Produce Riots", an audio player that features sounds that ATR used at a May Day protest in 1999, at which the band members were arrested.According to a press release, those sounds include "very low sub basses, square waves, noise sounds which trigger hysteria and panic within the audience." So your iPhone could make a whole lot of people very uncomfortable, if hooked up to big speakers-- which ATR encourages, via press release.But Apple has held up the app's release while they investigate whether it's legal to release an app with all those noises on it. The band had hoped to get the app out in time for this year's May 1 protests, but that didn't happen.Responding to inquiries about the app's status, ATR mastermind Alec Empire writes, "Today's status is that the ATR iPhone will be released within the next ten days. The Riotsounds player might be added later with an update. It's a legal loophole. So not sure yet what the outcome will be. But the free app which includes all ATR songs and videos plus a lot of extras will still be pretty awesome, even if the Riotsounds player is not included in this version. ATR plans regular updates for the app including free bonus tracks, unreleased songs, outtakes and more."On May 24, the group will release the reunion single "Reactivate" on their own Digital Hardcore label.

The Federal Communications Commission is examining a recent decision by Apple to reject an iPhone application developed by Google. On Friday, the commission sent letters to executives at Apple, Google and AT&T, which is the exclusive carrier for the iPhone in the United States, saying it was “interested in a more complete understanding of this situation.”In opening the investigation, the F.C.C. cited an article in The New York Times this week describing Google’s frustration in winning approval from Apple to distribute its iPhone applications through Apple’s App Store. Apple recently rejected Google’s effort to bring a service called Google Voice to the iPhone, and the company also rescinded its earlier approval of several applications created by third-party developers that worked with Google Voice.In its letter to Apple, the F.C.C. asked the company to explain why it rejected the application and removed the related applications from its App Store. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment, saying the company does not typically discuss regulatory issues.Google Voice, which is already available on BlackBerrys, provides users with free domestic calls, inexpensive international calls, free text messaging, call routing and other services. In a statement, Google said that its application had been rejected but that the company would “continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users, for example by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.” The company also said it would supply the information requested by the F.C.C..As part of its investigation, the F.C.C. focused on whether the decision to reject the Google Voice app was made by Apple alone or in consultation with AT&T. Industry analysts and others say AT&T has been increasingly concerned about the possible loss of revenue that could result from the Google Voice service. In its letter, the commission asked what role, if any, the company played in rejecting the Google Voice application, including whether there were any contractual understandings between the two companies that would have affected Apple’s decision.In a statement, AT&T said the company “does not manage or approve applications for the App Store.” AT&T also said it would respond to the F.C.C.’s letter, but a company spokesman, Fletcher Cook, declined to comment further.Google, which powers the world’s most popular search engine, has long had ties to Apple, and the two companies have a history of both competing and cooperating. Google’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, sits on Apple’s board of directors.

First came the rumors. Then came the leaked images. And now, 3 all-knowing (conveniently unnamed) analysts have predicted that Verizon’s long awaited foray into Android will happen some time next week with the announcement of Motorola’s Sholes/Tao smartphone. The timing seems feasible, especially considering that Motorola is holding a MOTODEV Android-related press event next Tuesday, October 6 (WinMo 6.5 who?).But, this is far from certain, folks. In fact, we have it on good word that Verizon retail employees have yet to train on Android, making a near term launch that much less likely. However, that does not rule out an announcement only like the recent Motorola CLIQ event.Either way, the speculation is definitely heating up. Just this morning the friendly folks over at AndroidGuys have posted information suggesting the Tao (or whatever it will end up being called) will be released on December 1, just in time for the all-mighty holiday shopping bonanza. But the fun doesn’t stop there.According to the super secret document that found its way to AndroidAndMe, the Tao will purportedly be the “world’s thinnest” slider QWERTY phone at 13.7mm thick. Yes, please! Other juicy tidbits include: a 3.7? 16:9 touch screen display, 16GB built-in storage, 5MP camera with dual LED flash, full HTML browser with Flash support, and supposedly the next generation of Android, the big 2.0.Here are the rest of the leaked specs:

Apple's next iPhone is once again rumored to sport a metal back using tech Apple's had a license to since 2010, but has not used much.After a brief hiatus, the long-standing rumor that Apple will employ more metal in the iPhone, has made a return -- and even taken a new twist.Citing unnamed industry sources, Korean news site ETnews says Apple will use Liquidmetal technology for the next iPhone, which the outlet boldly claims will be unveiled at Apple's annual worldwide developers conference.That conference, which has yet to be announced, typically takes place in June. Up until the last year, it has also been ground zero for the unveiling of new iPhones, including Apple's first-generation model.As for the question of whether Apple would even use such a material, it's been more of when, rather than if. Apple acquired an exclusive commercial license to Liquidmetal in late 2010. The technology, which Apple has used only for the SIM ejector tool it includes with some iPhone and iPad models, is billed as a metallic glass.In its documentation, Liquidmetal Technologies says that the individual pieces that come out of its process offer more strength, elasticity, and hardness than aluminum and titanium alloys, as well as stainless steel.ETnews adds that Apple will not be alone in using a new material for its flagship handset. Citing the same sources, it says Apple rival Samsung plans to use ceramics for its Galaxy S3 smartphone, which is expected to be unveiled next month.This is the latest in a series of rumors suggesting that Apple will use more metal in its smartphone. Last December, Boy Genius Report said that Apple would be using aluminum as the backing of the phone, just like it's done on all three generations of its iPad. Before that, DigiTimes claimed the back of the device would "be changed to a metal chassis instead of reinforced glass." Both rumors were preceded by a 9to5Mac report in March, saying Apple was making a move to metal instead of glass.

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

Here’s a list of 10 people who got the Apple iPad review units before anyone else.Apple’s marketing strategy for a new product (like the iPad) works something like this:Phase 1- Steve Jobs will announce the product in an “invite-only” event weeks before the product is actually due for shipping.Phase 2- Apple will send review units to a very select group of people (let’s call them the Inner Circle). These reviewers get to test the product (secretly) for days and, on a pre-decided date, they can push their reviews online.Phase 3 – Consumers can now buy the product. That’s the day when you see long queues of people camping outside the Apple retail stores.We’re still in Phase II of the iPad launch – the first reviews are in and everyone seems to be pretty impressed with the Apple Tablet Slate.Also see: How to Deliver a Presentation Like Steve JobsIf you compare the launch of iPad with a previous Apple product (say iPhone), you’ll notice one major change – Apple seems to have expanded their “inner circle” and, for the first time, they’ve sent review units to at least one person who is a popular blogger but not part of the mainstream media.The list now has 10 names including (clockwise):AOL’s Engadget and Gawker’s Gizmodo are the biggest gadget sites in the world and they probably draw more eyeballs that most mainstream websites put together but they’re not part of the Jobs’ circle yet.Update: Some more people have received review units from Apple though only after the first reviews were in. These include Natali Del Conte of CNET (CBS News) and Michael Gartenberg of ComputerWorld.

The white iPhone 4 looks as though it will never appear on the market due to all the delays. But one enterprising teenager called Fei Lam came up with a very lucrative idea. He decided to import the white iPhone 4 casing parts to the U.S. himself direct from Foxconn. He then offered a conversion service to anyone wanting their black iPhone made white.And guess what? Lots of people did and Lam has apparently generated around $130,000 in revenue so far. He sells front and back panels or full conversion kits for $279 through the website WhiteiPhone4Now with the tag line, “You don’t have to wait until Spring of 2011.”The only problem now is some mysterious private investigator is bugging Lam stating he is selling stolen goods. Lam believes it is Apple attempting to block what he is doing, or some trademark firm trying to make a quick buck by copying the action Apple is taking against eBay sellers.What’s unclear here is how Lam managed to get the parts from Foxconn who are under contract to Apple. Is it a case that Foxconn has stock piles of these cases and just wants to get rid of them, or is Lam’s supplier not really an official contact at the manufacturing firm?One thing that is clear, though. If you want an iPhone 4 in white this seems to be the only way to get one at the moment.There’s something fishy here. If Foxconn is selling the white cases to Lam, then why is Apple not shipping white iPhones already? It could be the batches are so small that doesn’t makes sense to Apple, but Lam buying a few hundred or so at a time sounds feasible.Also, has anyone ever met anyone using one of these kits, or heard talk of them on forums? Do they actually exist or is Lam’s website just a front? I have to ask because I’ve never heard of it before yet he’s managed to generate so much revenue.If Apple knows this is happening then they’d stop the shipments from Foxconn immediately. If they know and this continues then clearly the cases aren’t coming through legitimate channels from the Chinese company.

The iPhone 4?s screen may be the best mobile display yet, but its resolution does not exceed the human retina, as Steve Jobs claims.The math just doesn’t add up, said Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, who explained that the iPhone 4?s purported “retina display” was a misleading marketing term.“It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far,” Soneira said.During his keynote speech, Jobs said the iPhone 4?s display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. He claimed that this resolution exceeds the limit of the human retina, which Jobs said was 300 pixels per inch for a display about a foot away.“It turns out there’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch, that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes, is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels,” Jobs said.Soneira, who possesses a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton and has been studying displays for 20 years, said it was inaccurate to measure the resolution of the eye in terms of pixels, because the eye actually has an angular resolution of 50 cycles per degree. Therefore, if we were to compare the resolution limit of the eye with pixels on a screen, we must convert angular resolution to linear resolution. After conversions are made, a more accurate “retina display” would have a pixel resolution of 477 pixels per inch at 12 inches, Soneira calculated.He noted, however, that he was confident Apple will have the best phone display on the market. Like the iPad’s LCD display, the iPhone 4?s screen features In-Plane Switching technology, in which crystal molecules are oriented so their motion is parallel to the panel rather than perpendicular. For viewers, the result is a very wide viewing angle — up to 180 degrees — with brilliant color. Soneira added that we might not realistically need anything better than 326 ppi.For comparison, glossy magazines are typically printed at 300 dots per inch.Soneira said he wanted to highlight that “retina display” is a symptom of a larger problem of market puffery in the display industry. Basically, many manufacturers exaggerate claims about their display specifications — everything from resolution to viewing angle, and from brightness to contrast — and they have to do it because everyone is doing it.“The marketing puffery is now in control,” Soneira said. “Everything that’s being said now is just this superamplified imaginary nonsense, and the only way to get people’s attention now is making more outlandish statements.”For example, Soneira discarded Sharp’s Quattron TVs that claimed to display four primary colors (as opposed to the traditional three) as utter nonsense. He explained in an earlier Maximum PC guest article that all television and movie content is produced and color balanced in the traditional RGB color arrangement. Sharp Quattron’s fourth primary color is yellow, and there is nothing for it to do because yellow is already reproduced with mixtures of the red and green primaries, he said.“[Market puffery] hurts companies that make good products, like Apple, because they can’t really put the specs out because everybody is lying,” Soneira said. “If you and I have the world’s greatest display, and we launched it and put down the real scientific numbers, we’d go bankrupt because our numbers would look like the worst display being made.”

Not interested in waiting until the 23rd for Verizon's big announcement? Don't worry, we've got you covered right now! The Motorola Droid X has probably been one of the worst kept smartphone secrets in recent memory, but after spending two hours with the phone we sort of see why. In short, it's pretty awesome. Call it a superphone or a mega-smartphone, but the 4.3-inch handset is absolutely Verizon / Motorola's answer to the HTC EVO 4G , and makes the Droid Incredible look like a bench warmer. What do we mean? We'll let you see for yourself just after the break in a breakdown of exactly what this phone is all about -- and in a video or three of it in action. Oh, and on your way down, make sure to feast your eyes on the gallery, too. So here are our main takeaways: Pretty promising, isn't it? We should know more when we get an announcement toward the end of the month, but in the mean time, we're really excited about what Moto's got going on here. There have been conflicting reports on the Droid X's screen size. We're going with 4.3-inches for now. Sam Sheffer contributed to this article.

Under the radar of this week’s WWDC news is a small but very significant change to the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement. The change is in the oft-controversial section 3.3.2. Here is the last sentence of the old copy:Here is the new copy:Unless otherwise approved by Apple in writing, no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with Apple’s prior written consent, an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application.?I’ve said before that Apple’s aversion to interpreted code and external runtimes is the potential for someone else to take the platform over. That’s not the whole story, though. Games in particular tend to use engines and libraries that leverage interpreted languages such as Lua. Many of these applications pose no threat, neither implicitly nor explicitly.While explicit approval from Apple is still required, these new terms seem to acknowledge that there’s a difference between an app that happens to have non-compiled code, and a meta-platform. It’s a step that should allow for many new possibilities.

Nokia is investigating reports of problems with its touchscreen 5800 phone in the US, just days after the mobile was launched.The device has been removed from sale at two flagship stores in the US.The problem is with connections to US 3G networks, BBC News has learned.A spokeswoman for Nokia told BBC News: "A small number of devices are not connecting with 3G networks and we are looking through that right now."She said the phone continued to be sold in "certain network areas".At the New York and Chicago flagship stores only the European version of the Nokia 5800 is on sale.Sales agents at the New York store are telling customers the phone has a "little issue" and they are "not being sold at all while the problems are looked into".Nokia launched the 5800 Xpress Music phone in the US last Friday and the device has been described as the firm's response to the iPhone.The European version of the 5800, which cannot access 3G networks in the US, is still being sold and is unaffected by the problem, BBC News understands.In a statement Nokia said the issue was "a very isolated problem concerning only the North American market and is not specific to any other region or country".It added: "Nokia is investigating the issue. Existing customers of the 5800 XpressMusic who experience 3G signal issue with the device are advised to contact Nokia Customer Care."

With Apple's top marketing executive on the stand and under oath, Samsung's lawyers attempt to pry out information about Apple's next iPhone.SAN JOSE, Calif. -- There's been no shortage of once-confidential Apple information spilling out recently, ahead of the Apple v. Samsung patent trial here. But with the proceedings in full swing, today could have brought the biggest revelation of all.During the cross-examination of Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller, Samsung's attorney tried to get the executive to talk about a product that hasn't been announced yet.In an attempt to get Schiller talking about design, Samsung attorney William Price asked Schiller whether Apple's next iPhone model would look anything like existing versions, or if changes were in store.Apple's legal team jumped up to object the question immediately, telling U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh that an answer would be divulging confidential information. After a brief pause, Koh overruled, saying she would let Price ask the question.Schiller, looking nervous, sought confirmation from Price of what had just been asked of him. Then he said, "I prefer not to tell confidential information about future products."Apple is expected to roll out a new version of the iPhone next month, per numerous rumors. That event is rumored to take place on September 12, by which time this trial will presumably be wrapped up.You can check out CNET's complete coverage of the trial here. And our roundup of iPhone 5 rumors is here.

The annual Pwn2Own contest at CanSecWest is underway, and on the first day Web browsers fell to attack. Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.6.2 on 64-bit Windows 7 and Safari on OS X all were forced to run exploit code. To add insult to injury, an iPhone was cracked and the SMS database lifted from it.The IE exploit is the most interesting because it bypasses both DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), albeit in a very cumbersome way, The researcher, Peter Vreugdenhil, explains exactly what he did in a paper on his web site.Pwn2Own rules require the exploit code to read a particular file on the system in order to register that the exploit has run. But could Vreugdenhil's exploit have written to the disk? It's not clear. Web pages in IE7 on Vista and IE8 on Vista and Windows 7 both run in "Protected Mode," a special crippled user context in which the browser only has write access to the temporary Internet files directories. While exploit code could do some malicious things under Protected Mode restrictions, it could not, for example, set itself up to run at boot or login.The Firefox exploit was performed by Nils (no last name given) of U.K.-based MWR InfoSecurity. Nils is contractually prevented from disclosing the exact details of the exploit for now. He indicated that the hard part of it, as with IE8, was bypassing ASLR and DEP. But Nils also implied that Firefox did a bad job of opting in to ASLR, so perhaps that's a clue to what he did.Over on the Apple front, Charlie Miller exploited a critical Safari vulnerability on a MacBook. Details on this hack are also under wraps until Apple gets a chance to address it.And finally, Vincenzo Iozzo and Ralf Philipp Weinmann were successful in hijacking an iPhone through a malicious web page. Among other things, they were able to read the entire SMS database, including text messages that had already been deleted, and upload them to a server they controlled.Thanks to Threatpost for the links.

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

UPDATE: Now It’s Personal: Apple ditches private investigator, personally taking on teen who sold white iPhone 4 kits > Read the breaking news here !A 17-year-old geek from Queens has turned the fervor for the unreleased white iPhone 4 into a six-figure business — enough to send himself to college, so long as he can stay out of trouble with the law.The unbelievable demand among Apple enthusiasts for the long-delayed white version of the iPhone 4 has been compared to the hunt for that legendary white whale, Moby Dick.So when Fei Lam, a high school senior and gadget nerd, got a tip about buying up some white iPhone 4 parts, he saw the opportunity to finally make his passion for electronics pay off.According to Lam, who speaks fluent Chinese, about six months ago he was able to make a connection with Apple’s infamous overseas supplier. “I knew a guy from a few years back that had somewhat of a relationship with folks in Foxconn,” Lam told The Observer by email.Lam created a site, whiteiphonefournow.com, to sell conversion kits that turn regular iPhone 4?s into their elusive white version.NEED A FUNNY SLIDE SHOW? CLICK HERE FOR : IF STEVE JOBS’ NECK COULD SEND HIM A TEXT MESSAGE, WHAT WOULD IT SAY?During the first month or so, Lam only sold one or two parts a day, and because he was getting the pieces himself, repacking and shipping them, he actually lost money.But he quickly figured out how to have the parts ship direct and his venture was noticed by major sites like TechCrunch, CNET and CNN, helping him to sell more than $130,000 worth of parts since this past August.“I’m very thankful, cause for months I was struggling for an idea that would bootstrap my first startup and help pay for college,” says Lam, who hopes to attend NYU and study computer science or business.Yesterday however, Lam received an ominous letter. “I got an email from a private investigator accusing me of selling stolen goods, which I’m 100 percent sure is not the case. They are some kind of anti-counterfeit/trademark firm, which sounds ridiculous, similar to what Apple is bringing up to remove White iPhone 4 Listings on eBay. I don’t know how this legal stuff works.”The consequences for selling stolen good online can be steep. In September a women in Kansas was convicted of selling stolen goods on eBay. She faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Lam intends to contact a lawyer and has no plans to take his site down or change his business. “There are a couple of other sellers online and somehow I’m the ‘focus’ of it all. I think this guy is just trying to scare me into stop selling on behalf of Apple.”He can take heart in the fact that Steve Jobs, along with his partner Steve Wozniak, helped to fund their first business selling “Blue Boxes” that let users make illegal long distance telephone calls.The Observer has reached out to Apple for comment.Read the thrilling part 2 of the Fei Lam story here: Apple ditches their P.I., now it’s personal!If Steve Jobs Neck Could Send Him A Text Message, What Would it Say?Can Joe Einhorn Build A Database of Every Object in the World?

Apparently, Apple has recently decided to start trying to enforce its official "Guidelines for Third Party Promotions," meaning that they're telling people they can no longer offer contests and promotions where the prize is a "free iPad" or something of that nature. Specifically, the "guidelines" state:That all sounds lovingly dictatorial on the part of Apple, but I'm left scratching my head how the company thinks these guidelines are even remotely enforceable. If someone has legitimately bought one of these devices, I can't see under what legal basis Apple can claim that a giveaway promotion violates the law. Perhaps there's a weak trademark claim, but I can't see it holding up in most cases (there could be a few exceptions). But, really, what is Apple thinking here? People use its products in giveaways and contests because the product is . Why fight that?

Hey iPhone users: how many times a day do you take your beloved device out of your pocket just to check the time, change the tune, check email or see who's calling? What if we wore some kind of notification device on our wrists -- let's call them watches -- that could connect to your iPhone to do all of the above and more? And what if it didn't cost an arm and a leg?[More from Mashable: Snapstagram Wants to Print Your Instagram Photos [VIDEO]]Smart watches aren't exactly a new notion. In the past year we've seen and reviewed several: the InPulse, the WiMM One and the oddly-named I'm Watch. But they were all powered by Android, or connected to Android smartphones only.iPhone owners were out of luck -- until Wednesday, when a new smart watch by the guy behind InPulse (Eric Migicovsky, above) hit funding site Kickstarter. Dubbed the Pebble, it's the first smart watch that can form a meaningful, long-lasting relationship with your iOS device, as well as Android.[More from Mashable: 10 Waterproof Smartphone Cases to Prevent Disaster]And it's nothing if not popular. The Kickstarter campaign asked for $100,000 in funding; it got that in the first two hours. By day's end, the device had more than $500,000 in pledges.What's so smart about the Pebble? Well, for starters, it doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Other smart watches offer color screens as if they're trying to be a mini-smartphone. The Pebble lets your iPhone do all the heavy lifting. Its simple e-paper display -- much like the original Kindle -- is viewable even in direct sunlight, which is pretty necessary for a watch.It is also releasing its software kit to developers, so they can create their own iPhone app-linking apps. Out of the box, you'll be able to see incoming emails and calls, track your run and your bike ride via your phone's GPS, as well as use your watch as a remote for the music app on your phone.That feature alone seems worth the asking price -- which, by the way, will be $149.Check out the video below for more, and let us know in the comments: would you wear this?This story originally published on Mashable here.

As Verizon iPhone speculation heats up ahead of tomorrow's Verizon Wireless press conference, it appears that even rival AT&T can't keep its mouth shut.Yesterday, AT&T's vice president of communications, Larry Solomon, told Business Insider that "the iPhone is built for speed, but that's not what you get with a CDMA phone. I'm not sure iPhone users are ready for life in the slow lane."Several publications have taken Solomon's comment as proof positive that Verizon will announce the Apple iPhone tie-up tomorrow.Verizon hasn't commented on the trash talk, but this morning Verizon's policy blog editor John Czwartacki retweeted an article entitled "Rant: AT&T should shut up about Verizon iPhone."Does Solomon's claim have merit? If the Verizon iPhone confirms carriage on its legacy 3G network rather than its nascent 4G LTE network as most believe, then the answer is yes.Big Red may deliver more consistency and capacity than AT&T, especially in San Francisco and New York, but in PCMag's search for the Fastest Mobile Networks 2010 we found that AT&T performed faster than Verizon nationwide. It delivered average download speeds of 1.79Mbits/sec compared to Verizon's 1.01Mbits/sec.Instead of fighting speed, Verizon appears to be attacking the AT&T iPhone's Achilles' heel: capacity. Over the weekend the Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Verizon was "confident enough in its network" to offer unlimited data plans with the iPhone.

A ninth employee has jumped to his death at Taiwanese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, China's state media reports.Xinhua said 21-year-old Nan Gang leapt from a four-storey factory in China's Shenzhen in the early hours.Shortly after, it emerged that the death of a worker at a Foxconn plant in China's Hebei province earlier this year was also a suicide.A total of 11 Foxconn employees in China have tried to kill themselves this year - two have survived.The incidents have raised concerns about worker treatment at the site.The Associated Press quoted spokesman Arthur Huang as saying the company carried out social responsibility programmes to ensure workers' welfare.Earlier this week, Foxconn said it was enlisting counsellors and Buddhist monks to provide emotional support for its workers.Ten of the employees worked at Foxconn's campuses in Shenzhen, but on Friday it was revealed that a man who died at a factory in the northern Hebei province had also jumped from a building.The worker, identified by Xinhua as 19-year old Rong Bo, died in the city of Langtang early this year.A similar investigation into the death of 16-year old Wang Lingyan - who was found dead in a dormitory at the same site - concluded she died from cardiac arrest, government spokeswoman Wang Qiunu told Xinhua.Foxconn is part of Hon Hai Precision, the world's largest maker of consumer electronics, and employs 800,000 workers worldwide, mostly in China.The company has said it is taking the deaths seriously, even though a local government investigation did not blame working conditions.The spate of deaths comes after a Foxconn employee in charge of shipping Apple's iPhone prototype units killed himself last year after one of the units went missing.Apple said it had investigated accusations of bad employment practices by Foxconn stemming from a June 2006 complaint, and found the claims to be largely unfounded.However, it concluded that some employees were working more than Foxconn's mandated maximum during peak production times, and as many as a quarter of them were not taking at least one day off a week.US-based China Labour Watch has criticised Foxconn's "military-style administration and harsh working conditions" and called on the company to "initiate a thoroughgoing analysis of life on its production lines".Foxconn says it has hired 100 counsellors and invited monks to help workers at a new Employee Care Centre and trained its medical staff to provide emotional support.It has also introduced a reward system for employees who spot colleagues with emotional problems, and a hotline for workers.

When it comes to smartphones, Apple's iPhone may be top of mind, but mobile devices with Google Android guts pose the biggest threat to Jobs and Co.According to a new market research study from Google-owned AdMob, the iPhone held about a 50 percent share of the global operating system (OS) market for smartphone devices browsing the internet in February 2010. While that statistic may not be surprising, AdMob found that Google Android is creeping up from behind, capturing about 24 percent of the market share. Nokia-owned Symbian placed third with 18 percent of the market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (RIM) and Microsoft Windows Mobile are left in the dust with a paltry 4 percent and 2 percent of market share, respectively, despite its solid smartphone sales.In the U.S., AdMob found that in February 2010 the Apple iPhone operating system held a 44 percent market share, down from 55 percent in November 2009; while Android's share rose in the U.S. from 27 percent in November to 42 percent in the most recent AdMob report.While Apple maintained a 50 percent market share globally, Google Android devices like the Motorola Droid, the Motorola CLIQ, and a slew of HTC handhelds like the Dream, the Hero and the Magic helped push Google Android to No. 2, according to the study results."Android was the fastest growing operating system in the AdMob network year-over-year," the study explained. "Android's share of smartphone requests increased from 2 percent in February 2009 to 24 percent in February 2010."The study, according to AdMob, illustrates that Apple iPhone and Google Android users take advantage of the mobile Internet more than users of competing devices.AdMob services mobile ads for more than 15,000 mobile Web sites and applications globally and stores and analyzes the data from every ad request, impression and click within its network and issues monthly reports based on that data to evaluate the mobile device and mobile Internet ecosystem.Other findings in AdMob's most recent study show that smartphones accounted for about 48 percent of AdMob's worldwide traffic in February 2010, which was up from 35 percent in February 2009. The increase in smartphone traffic pushed traffic from feature phones down. Feature phone use declined from 58 percent a year ago to 35 percent in February 2010.

CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — Tucked into the U.S. Supreme Court’s agenda this fall is a little-known case that could upend your ability to resell everything from your grandmother’s antique furniture to your iPhone 4.At issue in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons is the first-sale doctrine in copyright law, which allows you to buy and then sell things like electronics, books, artwork and furniture, as well as CDs and DVDs, without getting permission from the copyright holder of those products.Under the doctrine, which the Supreme Court has recognized since 1908, you can resell your stuff without worry because the copyright holder only had control over the first sale.Put simply, though Apple Inc. /quotes/zigman/68270/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL -0.85%  has the copyright on the iPhone and Mark Owen has it on the book “No Easy Day,” you can still sell your copies to whomever you please whenever you want without retribution.That’s being challenged now for products that are made abroad, and if the Supreme Court upholds an appellate court ruling, it would mean that the copyright holders of anything you own that has been made in China, Japan or Europe, for example, would have to give you permission to sell it.“It means that it’s harder for consumers to buy used products and harder for them to sell them,” said Jonathan Band, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the American Library Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries and the Association for Research Libraries. “This has huge consumer impact on all consumer groups.”Another likely result is that it would hit you financially because the copyright holder would now want a piece of that sale.It could be your personal electronic devices or the family jewels that have been passed down from your great-grandparents who immigrated from Spain. It could be a book that was written by an American writer but printed and bound overseas, or an Italian painter’s artwork.There are implications for a variety of wide-ranging U.S. entities, including libraries, musicians, museums and even resale juggernauts eBay Inc. /quotes/zigman/76117/quotes/nls/ebay EBAY +0.71%  and Craigslist. U.S. libraries, for example, carry some 200 million books from foreign publishers.“It would be absurd to say anything manufactured abroad can’t be bought or sold here,” said Marvin Ammori, a First Amendment lawyer and Schwartz Fellow at the New American Foundation who specializes in technology issues.The case stems from Supap Kirtsaeng’s college experience. A native of Thailand, Kirtsaeng came to America in 1997 to study at Cornell University. When he discovered that his textbooks, produced by Wiley, were substantially cheaper to buy in Thailand than they were in Ithaca, N.Y., he rallied his Thai relatives to buy the books and ship them to him in the United States.He then sold them on eBay, making upward of $1.2 million, according to court documents.Wiley, which admitted that it charged less for books sold abroad than it did in the United States, sued him for copyright infringement. Kirtsaeng countered with the first-sale doctrine.

Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch cancels his C4 programming conference in the wake of an Apple change he sees as stifling programming innovation.New restrictions that Apple added to its iPhone software developer kit have led an independent programmer to cancel a conference devoted to Mac programming and computer science.Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch announced Wednesday he canceled the C4 conference after four years organizing it because of new wording in a section of the iPhone OS 4.0 software developer kit."With resistance to Section 3.3.1 so scattershot and meek, it's become clear that I haven't made the impact I wanted with C4. It's also clear my interests and the Apple programming community's interests are farther apart than I had hoped," Rentzsch said.Central to the matter is the battle between Apple and Adobe Systems concerning Flash, an Adobe programming foundation widely used on the Web but banished from the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Apple further restricted even native applications originally written in Flash with new wording in section 3.3.1 of the iPhone OS 4.0 SDK, leading Adobe to cancel a Flash-for-iPhone programming tool as well. CEO Steve Jobs explained in a rare open letter in April, but his words didn't satisfy Rentzsch."By itself Section 3.3.1 wasn't enough to cause me to quit C4. I've weathered Apple lying to me and their never-ending series of autocratic App Store shenanigans. But unlike previous issues such as the senseless iPhone SDK NDA [nondisclosure agreement], the majority of the community isn't riled by 3.3.1. On this issue, Apple apologists have the loudest voice. They offer soothing, distracting yet fundamentally irrelevant counterpoints to Apple's naked power-grab."Rentzsch said he was motivated to produce C4 because he wanted to marry Mac programmers' "maniacal focus on user experience" with better low-level programming tools."I believed the best way to move software forward was to inform Apple programmers about better ways to build software--to infect the best top-downer minds with fertile discontent," he said. "My hope was that developers would care primarily about user experience yet also be passionate about utilizing lingual and tooling advances."Apple has thwarted that hope, though, with the new SDK license terms. Those read: "Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g., Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited).""Section 3.3.1 has broken my spirit," Rentzsch said. "Apple is crazy-innovative in terms of hardware and software design, but I can count the total number of software engineering advances they've made on one hand. Section 3.3.1 makes developers wholly reliant on Apple for software engineering innovation."Apple, which didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, has offered an explanation for the change to the programming tools license."We know from painful experience that letting a third-party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in substandard apps, and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third-party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features," Jobs said in his open letter. "We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers."

Peter Thiel is a grump, but a special kind of grump. He is a dystopian utopian (if such a person can exist). The investor who wrote the first check for Facebook both believes in the power of technology to transform our lives, and is perennially disappointed by it.A lengthy profile in the November 28, 2011 edition of the New Yorker (summary here) states: “his main lament is that America—the country that invented the modern assembly line, the skyscraper, the airplane, and the personal computer—has lost its belief in the future.”It is an argument he’s made before. Last September, at Disrupt SF he made the case that innovation is dead across most of the economy (you can watch the video of the session below). He is co-authoring a book on the subject with Max Levchin and Gary Kasparov, called The Blueprint.But what about something like the iPhone?  ”I don’t consider this to be a technological breakthrough,” he tells the New Yorker. Technology simply isn’t creating enough jobs or moving the needle in areas like transportation, health, or energy.From the article, here is his assessment on the impact of the Internet, Apple, and Twitter:“The Internet—I think it’s a net plus, but not a big one,” he said. “Apple is an innovative company, but I think it’s mostly a design innovator.” Twitter has a lot of users, but it doesn’t employ that many Americans: “Five hundred people will have job security for the next decade, but how much value does it create for the entire economy ? It may not be enough to dramatically improve living standards in the U.S. over the next decade or two decades.”Thiel is a natural contrarian who is never satisfied with the status quo, which is a good thing in a venture capitalist and startup mentor.  But I think he dismisses the global impact of technologies like the iPhone and social networks a bit too easily.Having a fully functioning computer in your pocket opens up entirely new experiences—and markets.  Was it predictable?  Yes.  But that doesn’t make it any less transformative.  Social media, combined with mobile technologies, are powering protests and revolutions around the world and changing the way people consume information.But will these technologies improve living standards? The fact that the companies creating the technologies are capital efficient shouldn’t be a mark against them. What about the economic value created by the people who use the technologies. Putting a computer in the hands of business people away from the office, or a farmer in the field could yield significant improvements in productivity. It all depends on what kind of value you place on staying connected.

Yes, but what has France to say?Samsung is demanding the source code of the iPhone 4S firmware, while Apple wants copies of Samsung's contract with Qualcomm and both companies are looking to France in their Australian case.France is important, as that's where the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is based and where Samsung agreed to license critical 3G patents on a Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) basis. But, as Australian business title iTnews reports, Samsung reckons Apple is breaching three of its patents, while Apple reckons the Qualcomm chips it uses come with patent rights, so wants to see the contract Samsung has with Qualcomm.Samsung is seeking an injunction on the iPhone 4S in Australia, though the only patents it can apply are fundamental to the W-CDMA (3G) standard and thus fall into the ETSI-mandated FRAND policy. Apple reckons it is free to use those patents having bought chips from Qualcomm, and Qualcomm has a licence from Samsung which Apple has seen, but only in a form so redacted as to be useless to its case.Apple has previously argued that its licence to the Lodsys (mobile payments) patents should also cover users of its services (mobile developers taking payments through iTunes), so Cupertino obviously believes patent rights should be transferable, but that will depend on the contract Samsung has with Qualcomm, which is why Apple wants to see it.Samsung, meanwhile, wants to see the iPhone 4S firmware so it can establish that Apple really is breaching its patents, something Apple still denies.Samsung has tried to get injunctions against the 4S in America, France and Italy, where cases continue, with only the Dutch courts ruling in Apple's favour. Samsung is also pursuing a separate case though the Australian courts, involving the same three patents, and four others, in the increasingly impenetrable battle between the two companies.In this instance the judge reckons all these demands for documents mean the case isn't going to fit into the four-day schedule, and will start considering which of the various document requests should be sustained when the case continues on Friday. ®

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is developing a smartphone that would vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s iPhone and handheld devices that run Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Android operating system, two people with knowledge of the matter said.Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038), the Chinese mobile- phone maker, is working with Amazon on the device, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Amazon is seeking to complement the smartphone strategy by acquiring patents that cover wireless technology and would help it defend against allegations of infringement, other people with knowledge of the matter said.A smartphone would give Amazon a wider range of low-priced hardware devices that bolster its strategy of making money from digital books, songs and movies. It would help Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos -- who made a foray into tablets with the Kindle Fire -- carve out a slice of the market for advanced wireless handsets. Manufacturers led by Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple shipped 398.4 million smartphones and other mobile devices in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC.Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in November that Amazon is planning to release a smartphone.Seattle-based Amazon considered buying wireless patents from InterDigital Inc. before the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania- based company said in June that it will sell the assets to Intel Corp. for $375 million, two people said. Amazon is taking pitches and setting up briefings with other sellers, the people said.Amazon slipped less than 1 percent to $225.05 at the close in New York. Foxconn gained 3.7 percent in Hong Kong.Amazon beefed up its patent prowess recently by hiring Matt Gordon, formerly senior director of acquisitions at Intellectual Ventures Management LLC, the company that was founded by former Microsoft Corp. Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold and owns more than 35,000 intellectual property assets. Gordon will be general manager for patent acquisitions and investments at Amazon, according to his profile on LinkedIn.Adding patents would help Amazon protect itself against lawsuits alleging illegal use of technology. Amazon has been involved in five patent-related cases this year, and 20 cases last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Demand for mobile patents has increased, as shown recently by Google’s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and its thousands of patents, which closed this year.To contact the reporters on this story: Tim Culpan in Taipei at tculpan1@bloomberg.net; Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.net; Ashlee Vance in San Francisco at avance3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net

If you’re someone who always ends up having to shell out extra money for your monthlycell phone bill because 1,000 anytime minutes just isn’t enough, there’s a solution for you (and, don’t worry, it does not involve talking less). VoIP (voice over internet protocol) phone systems no longer only pertains to the world voip business phone systems, and its advantages have now become available for the iPhone. If you’re familiar with VoIP phones, then you already know how cost-effective they can be for those who have to make frequent long-distance phone calls. Such savings can now be applied to cell phone use, and it is estimated by one company that offers VoIP for iPhones that people may be able to save up to 80% by using a VoIP application on their cell phone (Mobile Dev & Design).The iPhone has taken the capabilities of small business phone systems to a whole new level. Using the technology of a VoIP phone system (using Internet protocol to send and receive calls), users can now place long-distance or even international calls without having to worry about the charges. Internet phone systems, such as VoIP, are a much cheaper alternative to sending calls on your iPhone the traditional way – using your minutes.VoIP phone system companies now offer applications you can download to your iPhone which will give it the capabilities of ip phone systems. There are many applications available, however, some are more favored over others. Here are our favorites:has been given high ratings by such publications as The Times, The New York Times,and Stuffmagazine. This application is favored, in particular, because it allows users to search their iPhone’s contact list. In addition, calls are very clear, and can be made and received without delay.allows you to stay in touch with contacts on multiple networks, such as Skype, AIM, and MSN. iCall can be completely integrated with your iPhone, and works with a Wi-Fi connection. If you are using Wi-Fi and receive a call, you can easily switch over to your iCall application and save your minutes. Papaya and PennyTel are also VoIP applications for your iPhone.You also have the option of using web-based VoIP applications (which is kind of like using a hosted VoIP system in your office). Instead of downloading the application to your iPhone, you can simply log-in to your account online. JAJAH is one of the top web-applications, and looks like your iPhone’s dialing pad. Talkety, Raketu, and iPhoneGnome are also web-based.RingFree was one of the first VoIP services for your iPhone, and allows you to make calls using any VoIP service provider you choose. This application also allows you to make calls through an office phone system or virtual pbx.Now that you can use VoIP technology with your iPhone, ‘unlimited’ minutes has a whole new meaning. VoIP business phone systems have the capabilities to be even more mobile. The iPhone has taken softphone technology to the next level, allowing calls to be placed all over the world without having to pay the high cost. This is great for business travelers who need to be able to stay in-touch with co-workers or loved ones.Now you have more money for important things, like downloading the latest hit song to be your ringtone.

Apple will be the only initial vendor to offer adapters and cables for its new 9-pin iPhone dock connector, with the new adapter costing around $10 and USB cables for $19, according to a new report.Citing sources familiar with the company's plans, iLounge reported on Wednesday that the new "Dock Connector Adapter" from Apple will cost about $10, while three-packs will be available for $29. There won't be any third-party adapters available for the new iPhone, at least at launch. Apple will also be selling its own USB cables for charging and syncing the new iPhone for $19 each. Apple is said to have stopped approving third-party proposals for connector-equipped accessories in recent months. Sources in the third-party accessory business have reportedly expressed concern that Apple could block out cable makers much as it has done with the MagSafe connector on its notebooks. "One source notes that Apple will reap a windfall by limiting competition in this manner, generating revenues of $100 million for every 10 million Dock Connector Adapters it sells for $10," author Jeremy Horwitz wrote. "According to the source, Apple estimates that it will sell the first 10 million Adapters by the end of 2012." Last month, AppleInsider was first to report last week that Apple's new mini dock connector for its next iPhone is expected to feature a 9-pin, orientation-independent design ? 8 gold pins that have been seen, plus the metal shell of the connector also serving as a functional contact. Taking cues from its patented MagSafe adapters, the new plug is expected to work in two orientations. The new mini dock connector will also take up about 60 percent less real estate than its predecessor, the legacy 30-pin dock connector that has been a staple of Apple's handheld devices since it debuted in the third-generation iPod classic nearly 10 years ago. The new, smaller dock connector is expected to be one of the new features on Apple's next-generation iPhone. The company has scheduled a keynote presentation for next week where it will presumably unveil its new handset.

We all worry about personal safety. Chances are you have some form of self-defense on hand, just in case something happens. However, in the heat of the moment, are you really going to have it in hand and ready for use?The Yellow Jacket was created by a man who was attacked in his home. While he had firearms and a Tazer nearby, none of these items were within his grasp, which is what made him think about weaponizing his phone. Yellow Jacket is an iPhone case that comes equipped with a 650K volt stun gun, and is also capable of giving your phone an additional 20 hours of battery life. Not only can this save you from an attacker, but will also make sure your phone doesn’t die near the end of the day when you may actually need it. If you jump on this project now, it will only cost you $85, otherwise you’ll be looking at about $100.

Don't expect to see this in stores anytime soon, but evidently technology from two mobile phone rivals can be made to cooperate.There are matches made in heaven, and on the other side of the spectrum, there is David Wang's accomplishment: booting Google's Android operating system on Apple's iPhoneWang, the "planetbeing" member of the a group called the iPhone Dev Team devoted to hacking iPhones, on Wednesday posted a video demonstrating Android on an iPhone.The demo shows the boot process--complete with the Tux Linux mascot--and Wang using Android for browsing, receiving a text message, answering a phone call, and playing music. The phone is set up with a dual-boot configuration and indeed the video begins with the device running iPhone OS."It's not really production-quality yet," Wang said on the video. "I'd say it's alpha quality. But pretty much everything works."The Android-on-iPhone hack is a notable technical accomplishment, but it's not likely to transform the industry or alter what mainstream users do. It does indicate, though, that the hacking ethos is alive and well despite Apple's attempts to keep its mobile phone locked down.Wang has been working since at least 2008 to boot Linux on the iPhone, according to his blog. The demonstration uses a first-generation iPhone, but newer models should be supported at some point."It should be pretty simple to port forward to the iPhone 3G. The 3GS will take more work," Wang said on the blog. "Hopefully with all this groundwork laid out, we can make Android a real alternative or supplement for iPhone users. Maybe we can finally get Flash. ;)"As you might expect, there are problems with Android on the iPhone. "It's slightly buggy because I didn't bother to implement all the Android-specific driver extensions," he said in the video demonstration. And it's slow, since Wang is using Android in debug mode.He can type using a virtual keyboard, but the iPhone's one-button interface doesn't mesh well with Android, which runs on phones typically with five or more buttons."There's a little bit of a button shortage on the iPhone," Wang said.

The first day of the annual Pwn2Own contest in which security researchers can win cash and hardware if they successfully compromise machines using zero-day exploits is finished. Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7, Firefox 3 on Windows 7, Safari 4 on Mac OS X 10.6, and iPhone OS 3 were all compromised during the competition. Google's Chrome was the only browser left standing—and in fact, was completely untested. None of the researchers at the competition even tried to attack Chrome.So far, little is known about the successful exploits. Until vendors have been informed of the flaws and those flaws have been patched, details will not be made public.The iPhone was not successfully hacked in 2009's competition, but was predicted to fall this year, and those predictions have come true. A zero-day Safari flaw was used to gain access to text messages stored on the device by Vincenzo Iozzo from German security firm Zynamics and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg. Notable in the exploit was that it bypassed both iPhone's Data Execution Protection as well as its requirements that all code be signed.A little more is known about the IE8 exploit, including an (abridged) video of the browser being taken down. The successful researcher, Peter Vreugdenhil, has published a rough outline of the techniques used to bypass IE8's DEP and ASLR protections.The Safari hack came from Charlie Miller; this makes three years in a row now that Miller has pwned—and hence owned—a Mac at pwn2own. Thus far, nothing further about either this exploit or the Firefox one appears to have been published.Neither the iPhone exploit nor the IE8 exploit managed to escape the OS-supplied sandboxes that protect these platforms. Without escaping the sandboxes, the impact that flaws can have is reduced, preventing, for example, writing to hard disk (and hence, preventing installation of malware). Nonetheless, read-only access is still valuable for data theft.It is this sandboxing that might explain why Google's Chrome was untouched; no researcher even attempted to attack it. It is certainly not the case that Chrome has no security flaws—a couple of days before the Pwn2Own draw was made to decide who got to attack which machine and in what order, Google published an update to Chrome that fixed a range of security flaws, some of which were deemed to be high-risk. Google's sandboxing shouldn't be impenetrable, but it is sufficient to make the standard harmless exploit payload—starting up Windows calculator—harder to do.

Apple is engulfed in at least four different federal lawsuits over reception problems with its new iPhone, as customers and their attorneys race to build class-action cases against the company. Angry customers, meanwhile, are reportedly swarming lawyers.Sacramento, California-based Kershaw, Cutter & Ratinoff LLC, known for its class-action against Facebook and Zynga and for announcing an iPhone investigation last week, filed suit against Apple in federal court in the Northern District of California on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the firm converted that individual case into a class-action. We've posted the filing here.John R. Parker, Jr., an attorney at KCR, said the law firm had been contacted by well over 1,000 iPhone customers. The firm's investigation received widespread coverage in the tech press and in the Northern California media.KCR isn't the only firm going after Apple. As our colleague Jesus Diaz at Gizmodo reported, another firm filed a case in U.S. District Court in Maryland on Wednesday. Another case was filed in Texas Tuesday. And an Encino-based law firm filed its own case Wednesday in the federal Northern District of California.It seems likely the cases will ultimately be combined. But it's also clear that, even if it's not fighting a five-front legal war, Apple is up against a fierce and determined alliance of aggrieved customers and the attorneys representing them. iPhone buyers feel understandably misled that, amid a long keynote introduction, and within a very detailed website, and inside a carefully-crafted ad campaign, and during the hours people were waiting in line — that during all that hype, Apple never found a moment to disclose a major quirk in its product.Apple can either pay in the marketplace to placate its generally adoring customers, or pay through the nose in court, whether through judgments or lawyers' fees. It's probably only a matter of time before the image-savvy company realizes that the former is much better from a public relations standpoint than the latter.KCR's class-action suit, filed in federal court in Northern California on behalf of iPhone customers, is below.

People identifying themselves as representing Apple last week visited and sought permission to search the Silicon Valley address of the college-age man who came into possession of a next-generation iPhone prototype, according to a person involved with the find.“Someone came to [the finder's] house and knocked on his door,” the source told Wired.com, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is under investigation by the police. A roommate answered, but wouldn’t let them in.Apple’s vaunted wall of secrecy was smashed wide open when one of its developers lost a next-generation iPhone prototype sometime in March at a bar in Redwood City, California. Another bar patron took the phone home and, having failed to find the owner, gave tech news site Gizmodo exclusive access to the device in exchange for $5,000. Gizmodo eventually returned the phone to Apple, but not before it published numerous photos and details.San Mateo County police are now investigating, and they seized computers from Gizmodo writer Jason Chen’s home last week under a search warrant that Gizmodo is challenging as unlawful. Police have also identified and interviewed the man who took the phone from the bar, the reportedTuesday.News of Apple’s lost iPhone prototype hit the web like a bombshell, but it was apparently an open secret for weeks amongst the finder’s roommates and neighbors, where the device was shown around mostly as a curiosity. According to the source, who has direct knowledge of the Gizmodo transaction, the group of friends suspected this might be Apple’s new phone, but no one knew for sure.“There was no effort to keep it secret,” the source said. “There were a bunch of people who knew.”The finder attempted to notify Apple and find the owner of the device but failed, even going so far as to search alphabetically through Facebook, the source said. Thoughts then turned to contacting the press about the device to confirm its authenticity and help locate the owner, but early attempts to drum up interest went unanswered. After a few days with no response, the finder expanded the search.“The idea wasn’t to find out who was going to pay the most, it was, Who’s going to confirm this?” the source said.The finder at one point attempted to restore the phone by connecting it to a roommate’s Apple computer, but was unsuccessful.News accounts depicting the $5,000 payment as a “sale” are incorrect, this person said. Rather, the agreement with Gizmodo was for exclusivity only. “It was made very explicit that Gizmodo was to help the finder return the phone to its rightful owner or give it back,” this person said. “Gizmodo said they could help restore the phone.”Wired.com received an e-mail March 28 offering access to the device, but did not follow up on the exchange after the tipster made a thinly veiled request for money.

There’s a really old joke that goes, “Doctor, my arm hurts when I move it this way,” and the doctor replies, “So don’t move it that way.” It’s stupidly funny because it’s such a simple solution, but it doesn’t really fix the problem. In the case of Steve Jobs, however, if he were the doctor he wouldn’t just tell you not to move your arm that way, he’d tell you that your arm really doesn’t hurt at all.When users started complaining about the iPhone 4?s reception problems, some decided to take it straight to Apple’s CEO. “My iPhone doesn’t work properly when I hold it this way,” some user cried. In typical Jobs fashion, his terse response was, “Just avoid holding it in that way.”Oh, but it didn’t stop there. After receiving another e-mail complaint, the megalomanical Jobs asserted us that there is no iPhone 4 reception issue at all and asked us to “stay tuned.”So here we have a widespread problem that Apple has acknowledged with an excuse that all phones do the same thing to a degree, and its response, along with its CEO, is that it’s not that big of a deal. Then we’re hit with another follow up that assures us there is no issue at all. I’m confused!If I bought a new Macbook Pro and the “E” key didn’t work, would I accept a response from Steve Jobs that said, “Just don’t us that lttr. Not that big of a dal.” Hell no! So what makes him think, aside from his ego and the idea that he creates some of the world’s most magical products, that iPhone users would accept his unusual and insulting solution to the smartphone’s antenna and reception problems. Oh wait, there are no reception problems.Steve, I like your products. I think they’re some of the best gadgets on the market, if not the best, today. But please make up your mind on the issue/non-issue we have with the iPhone 4 and fix it fast.

Hate going into AT&T stores and interacting with real humans? Worry not, as unlocking your AT&T iPhone is turning out to be a simpler process than expected for some users. The process can still be performed in-store by AT&T personnel, but it can also be done at home with the help of AT&T chat, Apple, and iTunes.We reported on Friday that AT&T would begin unlocking iPhones for qualified customers beginning Sunday, April 8. That was yesterday, and readers have begun reporting back with their experiences. As it turns out, all you really need is an active Internet connection and your iPhone's IMEI number to get started (you can get it from your iPhone under Settings > General > About). After logging into AT&T's website with your account credentials, you can then bring up AT&T's Wireless Support Chat where you can request your device be unlocked.As long as you meet the criteria—your phone isn't associated with an active-term commitment, you're out of contract, and your account is in good standing—AT&T will likely approve the request. But then it comes down to Apple, which has to push your unlock code to your e-mail address before you can proceed (this happens within 72 hours, but many users have said it took an hour or less). Once you receive the code, you must perform a backup and restore of the device through iTunes while tethered to a computer.As with most processes that are user-facing, the unlock process doesn't always work smoothly. AT&T's own documentation on the process points to this Apple support document on troubleshooting unlock issues, though there are a number of forum threads dedicated to discussing the nuances of performing the unlock procedure as well. Do you have any extra tips to offer for those who have yet to go through the process?Update: We have begun hearing that AT&T is making users call to initiate the unlock process instead of using the website chat feature. Still less effort than going into a retail outlet, but human interaction is somewhat required.
