Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has underlined his love for Android handsets, stating his gripes with the iPhone and why in many ways he prefers Google's OS.He even claimed voice commands worked better on Android, as does the GPS system, the Daily Beast reports.“My primary phone is the iPhone, I love the beauty of it. But I wish it did all the things my Android does, I really do,” said Woz.“If you’re willing to do the work to understand it a little bit, well I hate to say it, but there’s more available in some ways.”Woz feels the battle between Apple and Android is reminiscent of the rivalry between Windows and Macintosh during the 1990s, when Microsoft dominated the market after licensing its software to third-party manufacturers. The theory goes that Android is doing the same to Apple, slowly taking over through sheer volume.Unfortunately for the Cupertino giant, Woz reckons it is up against a stronger competitor this time.“There’s not as big a difference [between iOS and Android] as there was between Mac and Windows,” he said before highlighting Apple's strict app approval process as a hindrance that may give the edge to Android.While Apple has worked hard to promote Siri, its voice-recognition-based assistant for iPhone 4S, Woz stressed his disappointment with it.“I have a lower success rate with Siri than I do with the voice built into the Android," he blurted before stating his view that Android is "way ahead on navigation" and slating the iPhone's battery life.Woz does still recommend the iPhone as the best choice for most, though, redeeming his gripes in the eyes of fanboys.“The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it’s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don’t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person, who is scared of complexity, well, here’s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do.”Ooh, that was a close one, Woz. ®

One-Third of iPhone Users Mistakenly Think They Have 4G new survey from Retrevo Maybe the "4" in the iPhone 4 name gives iPhone owners (34%) the false impression that they already own a 4G phone but the fact is Apple doesn't offer a 4G phone at the moment. Coincidentally, a suspiciously large percentage of Android and BlackBerry owners may be suffering from the same delusion. BlackBerry owners (24%) are almost as confused as iPhone owners since RIM doesn't currently offer a 4G phone. At least some Android owners could be answering correctly as Android 4G phones like the HTC Evo 4G or Samsung Infuse 4G have been available for some time. If nothing else this large number of "misinformed" phone owners serves to emphasize the fact that consumers are quite confused about 4G. technically make the iPhone a 4G deviceOne-Third of iPhone Users Mistakenly Think They Have 4G According to a new survey from Retrevo , 34% of iPhone users are under the mistaken impression that they already have "4G" cellular technology on their devices, highlighting the confusion that has resulted from shifting definitions of just what constitutes "4G" speeds.Confusing the issue is the fact that the marketing term "4G" is now being used to apply to not only the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology being rolled out by Verizon and other carriers but also HSPA+ networks such as those run by AT&T and T-Mobile. In addition, carriers running HSPA+ and LTE network won't necessarily all be offering the same speeds for a given standard, resulting in a spectrum of data speeds for consumers to compare. Apple is not expected to offer LTE support in the next-generation iPhone, but has been said to be supporting HSPA+, which would technically make the iPhone a 4G device on GSM carriers that support the HSPA+ standard. But consumers appear willing to embrace the next iPhone even if it doesn't have 4G capabilities, with 40% of current iPhone owners stating they will be buying the next iPhone even without 4G and an additional 21% stating that they would consider purchasing it. Significant percentages of current Android and BlackBerry owners are also registering interest in the next iPhone, with or without 4G.

Last month, I wrote about two different Reddit applications for the iPhone, neither one actually made by the social voting site. While both were pretty good, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian clearly thought an official one could do a bit better — so they made one.Due to hit the App Store shortly, iReddit has all the features you’d expect from a Reddit iPhone app: voting, commenting and the ability to switch to different sub-Reddits. It also has some features the other Reddit apps didn’t have, such as the ability to easily switch between “Hot,” “New,” “Top,” and “Controversial” stories in any category — these classifications are a staple of the main Reddit site. This app also features story thumbail pictures (an option that can be toggled off as well).iReddit also has a unique flair that makes some iPhone apps stand out. For example, while the app is pretty fast, it loads all the stories’ actual websites through the app’s web browser, and it can take a bit of time for some of those page to load. So Ohanian chose to use that load time to me a quirky Reddit alient page load overlay (see the video below).But better is iReddits “shake for a new story” feature. Ohanian notes that the inspiration from this came form another great iPhone app, UrbanSpoon. That app works by giving your restaurant recommendations when you shake the iPhone thanks to the device’s accelerometer. iReddit has an option to use an iPhone shake to load what’s called “Serendipity” mode. A Star Wars lightsaber-like sound lets you know you’re entering it, and a big red “Serendipity” banner across the top lets you know that you’re in the mode.While in Serendipity mode, you will keep getting fed random stories to view/vote on every time you hit the “Hit me”  button or shake the iPhone. Clicking “No More!!!” will take you back to regular mode. Much like UrbanSpoon, I could see this Serendipity mode becoming addicting. It’s a bit like a completely random StumbleUpon (a website discovery tool), but again, using the iPhone’s accelerometer.Such a feature seems perfect for a social voting site, where users are often looking for new and interesting stories. The biggest of these sites, Digg, still does not have a native iPhone app.iReddit is fast, solid and yet quirky enough to stand above the other third-party Reddit apps. My only complaint is a minor one: that you can’t see the Reddit vote counts without clicking on a story. I’ve also had some issues loading the site’s custom Reddits, but the developers are aware of the issue and are looking into it.iReddit should be available soon in the App Store for $1.99 — cheaper than Satellite, the better of the twounofficial Reddit apps, which is $4.99, but more expensive than the one previously known as “reddit” but now called “open source reddit,” which is free. But I’m told that a free version of iReddit which is ad-supported will be made available in the next month or two as well.

Apple's homegrown processors in their iOS devices are pretty awesome, able to outperform—and in some cases, blow away—other mobile chipsets. Jim Keller, one of the men largely responsible for that feat, is leaving. Where is he going? AMD. Ouch.According to 9to5mac, Keller was an employee at PA Semi when the company was acquired by Apple, and while at Apple, was listed as "A4/A5 Designer & K8 Lead Architect." Of course, what makes this all the more intriguing is that Keller was hired by and will work under Mark Papermaster, a former iPhone employee who was dismissed after the whole Antennagate debacle came to light in 2010. Regardless your feelings about AMD, you can't deny that they now have two very talented employees. [9to5mac]

Apple (AAPL) launched the fastest-selling smartphone in history in late September and the company went on to post a record September quarter, during which it earned $8.2 billion in profit on $36 billion in sales. The company also issued impressive guidance for the holiday quarter, anticipating a record $52 billion in revenue. Since Apple’s stock hit a record high when the iPhone 5 launched, however, it has lost more than $130 billion in market value — closing at $558 on Wednesday, down nearly 21% since late September. Why is Apple’s stock tanking as the company continues to break record after record? Wall Street.As dominant as Apple is right now, Wall Street analysts continue to issue sky-high estimates that hammer the company when it can’t meet them. This is the game we play, of course, and while Apple’s stock soared when it was regularly beating estimates, it is now heading back down to Earth as analysts adjusted by raising expectations even further.When Apple only pulled in $8.2 billion in profit last quarter, it was a miss. And when the company only sold 3 million iPads during the iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad’s opening weekend, it was a miss. Now, a number of analysts are pushing the stock down further — DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach, for example, sent shares of Apple down further when he went on CNBC and said Apple’s stock is headed to $425.Even analysts that will remain bullish on Apple until the day it dissolves are inadvertently contributing to the stock’s tumble. When Apple sold a record 5 million iPhone 5 handset during the phone’s debut weekend, the company’s stock slipped because Apple bulls like Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster were calling for opening-weekend sales to reach as high as 10 million units.Will Wall Street lead to Apple’s ultimate demise? Is it even the Street’s fault or is Apple done innovating? Apple may very well be in decline, but beginning to panic in the midst what is shaping up to be the biggest quarter in history for a consumer electronics company may be somewhat premature, especially when most analysts’ fiscal 2013 estimates remain sky-high.

AT&T has apparently found a workable solution to the reported data congestion in New York City. They’ve quietly stopped selling the iPhone from their web site to customers in the New York metropolitan area.I guess that’s one way to solve the problem.Reader Stephen in Brooklyn made the discovery while shopping for a new phone today.I was on the AT&T Wireless website trying to get an iPhone. However, when I put in my zip code 11231, the site says the iPhone is unavailable. This seemed a little odd so I started punching in other famous zip codes: 90210, 60609 (spiegel catalog), 02134 (zoom, an old children’s show). For theses cities, LA, Chicago, Boston, iPhone is available. Then I looked up some other zip codes: Dallas, Miami, St. Louis, Philadelphia, San Francisco. All those cities are ok. Then I started putting in more NYC zip codes: midtown, Staten Island, the Bronx…no iPhone available. This is weird…AT&T has cut off New York City.I went to the AT&T site to verify what Stephen said. Sure enough, the iPhone was available to zip codes in San Francisco and other major cities. It was not available to purchase for people living anywhere in New York City, or any of the suburban zip codes in Westchester County or northern New Jersey that I tried. Was it a web site bug? I hopped online with a customer service chat rep to check.Daphne: Welcome to AT&T online Sales support. How may I assist you with placing your order today? Laura: Hi, I was looking at the iPhone 3Gs and the system tells me that I cannot order one in my ZIP code. My zip code is 11231. (Brooklyn, NY) Is this true? Are iPhones no longer available in New York City? Daphne: I am happy to be helping you today . Yes, this is correct the phone is not offered to you because New York is not ready for the iPhone. Daphne: You don’t have enough towers to handle the phone. Laura: Thank you for your help. So the phone is not available to people anywhere in the city? Daphne: Yes this is correct Laura.The iPhone is still available in Apple ant AT&T stores in and around New York CIty. Just not online. Why?Update 1: In a written statement, AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook told Consumerist that “We periodically modify our promotions and distribution channels.” We have requested additional details, and will add them when and if they become available.Update 2 (12/28/09): New York customers are now able to order iPhones via AT&T’s Web site. It would appear that the company has once more modified its “promotions and distribution channels.” We’ve requested a statement from AT&T, and will update this post it if and when we receive it.Is the iPhone available for sale where you live, online or in stores? Let us know in the comments, or e-mail tips@consumerist.com.RELATED: AT&T Network Struggling In iPhone-Dense Urban Areas Call Drop Rate For iPhones In NYC Is 30%, Says Apple Genius Why Do iPhone Owners Hate AT&T So Much?

Reddit, owned by Conde Nast (who also happens to own Ars Technica and Wired.com), is one of the popular social news website on the internet. So, if you are an avowed lurker at Reddit, like me, then an app for your iOS device can be helpful to budge through the popular /r sections wherever you go.iReddit is the official Reddit app for the iPhone, iPad and the iPod touch, and is fairly good at what it does. However, the frequent crashes, freezing, and no support for the app can be disappointing. Perhaps, that’s where the unofficial Reddit app comes into play.The app is “Alien blue,” which is free to download and works with the 3.x and the new iOS 4.0+ firmware. What makes this app better than the official is, of course, the easy to use interface and navigation available at the tap of a button. The main page is nifty, well organized with theme selection feature and added support for multiple user login is enough to jolt the Redditors.Alien blue app lets you select different themes by changing the appearance, allows you to tweak the settings, upvote (umm… downvote) posts and edit the comments. In short: Alien blue culminates into an impressive app that turns out to be much better than the iReddit.So, if you are intrigued by this short review, then check out the app (I am not affiliated with Alien blue) by visiting the iTunes page, or searching for “Alien blue” right from your Apple device. Yes, they do have a Pro version, but the free one does the job, actually a very good job!Edit: Thanks for the love, Reddit! And yes, for those of you who are using iPad, Alien blue isn’t free to download, but it is totally worth it ($1.99).

In August 2008, Apple approved an application in the App Store called I Am Rich. The app did nothing beyond show a picture of a red gem. So why was it notable? Because it cost $999.99. Though Apple pulled it relatively quickly, there was some concern that we'd start to see a rush of bogus applications and/or huge prices in the App Store. Luckily, that didn't happen and app prices have remained low (some would say too low). But now we have the return of a $999.99 app.But there's a big difference with this app; BarMax CA actually does something. And to the people it's aimed towards, it's likely to be very useful. And quite possibly worth the $1,000 price tag.BarMax CA is an application to help law students preparing for the bar exam. The reason the price is justified is because the company that is synonymous with this type of test prep, BarBri, typically offers it for $3,000 to $4,000. BarMax CA believes it can get away with the lower price because it's just an app, there is no in-class element. Also, there has been some questions about BarBri's pricing structure and anti-competitive behavior, which has been the subject of multiple class action lawsuits (hardly surprising when you're selling these packages to future lawyers).BarBri also offers an iPhone application, and it's free, but you need to enroll in their program to access it otherwise it's useless.So what do you get for your $1,000 BarMax CA app? A lot, actually. The app is over 1 gigabyte in size, which is the largest application I've ever seen. It includes thousands of pages of materials as well as hundreds of hours of audio lectures. It's all the information you could ever want for the two-month course. And again, it can be done all on your iPhone. That said, if you do want some more tangible paperwork for certain sections, BarMax will send you that electronically as well.The bar exam consists of three main parts: Multiple choice, essays, and a performance test. There is also an ethics exam you have to take. As you can probably tell by the name, BarMax CA is meant for the California bar exam. But by the end of 2010, the company expects to have apps available for New York, and the five other most popular states for the exam as well. There will also be a multi-state version since much of the test (the multiple choice part, for example) doesn't vary state to state. Each of these apps would cost the same $999.99 but there is also a plan to make an app with just the multiple choice part for $500.Mike Ghaffary came up with the idea when he himself was preparing for the bar exam. He could not believe BarBri charged the $4,000 to send him an iPod with audio notes on it, and that there was no real competition in the space. So he got in touch with some successful iPhone app developers in Los Angeles, as well as some fellow Harvard Law graduates to create the app. Ghaffary, who is the director of business development at TrialPay by day, is serving as an advisor now to the team.How this app sells will be interesting to say the least. Ghaffary confirmed that it is the most expensive app in the App Store, surpassing a home security app that sells for $899. Many iPhone developers have complained about a race to the bottom for app prices, but a few have tried to sell more expensive applications, such as Wolfram Alpha. But that $50 app doesn't really give you anything you can't get on its website, it just dresses the data up to look nicer on the iPhone. BarMax CA, again, is attempting to save law students thousands of dollars. It's a good experiment, if nothing else.Ghaffary notes that while Apple was extra careful in checking BarExam CA out due to the high price, they had no problems getting it approved, and Apple generally seemed pleased with the idea.Still, the thought of being able to spend $1,000 with one click on your iPhone remains a little terrifying. Find the app here.

An iPhone bug already seen when Australia switched between Daylight Savings Time and Standard Time a few weeks ago has now hit Europe. Twitter just lit up with reports of recurring iPhone alarms going off an hour later than usual. So even though the iOS clock changed correctly over the weekend, the alarm did not. Thing is, according to a ZDNet Australia report from more than three weeks ago, Apple acknowledged the bug with a promise to fix it with a software update. So why wasn't it rolled out in time to avoid this mess in Europe? Let's see if Apple fixes it before North America makes the switch on November 7th, otherwise, you've been warned.Deleting and re-adding the alarms will NOT fix the issue. We've now tested a number of scenarios under iOS 4.1 on European iPhone 4 and 3GS devices for ourselves. The bug (demoed on video after the break by Roman ) appears when using a repeating alarm for anything other than "every day." So for example, your alarm will go off an hour late if it's set for "weekdays," or "weekends," or every "Monday." The following alarms are not affected by the bug: You can test yourself by creating a repeating alarm (but not every day) to go off one minute in the future and 59 minutes in the past.: Some US readers are now waking up to alarms reportedly going off an hour early [Thanks, David O. and Matthieu Di B.]

Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota) has called upon Apple and Google to participate in a hearing with the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law in order to discuss consumer privacy. The hearing will take place May 10 at 10 a.m. EDT in Washington, where witnesses from the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, Center for Democracy and Technology and others will talk about what the latest mobile technology means for privacy and the law.“Recent advances in mobile technology have allowed Americans to stay connected like never before and put an astonishing number of resources at our fingertips,” Franken said in a statement. “But the same technology that has given us smartphones, tablets and cell phones has also allowed these devices to gather extremely sensitive information about users, including detailed records of their daily movements and location. This hearing is the first step in making certain that federal laws protecting consumers’ privacy — particularly when it comes to mobile devices — keep pace with advances in technology.”Device privacy has been an increasingly important topic to lawmakers in recent years, but discussion came to a head last week when two researchers revealed that the iPhone and 3G iPad keep a log file of every location the user has ever been, whether the iOS Location Services are turned on or not. The discovery was neither new nor hidden (and it turns out Google also does some level of location logging as well), but the announcement sparked a deeper look into how technology companies track and store our personal data.Franken was the first to fire off a letter to Apple over the news, followed by Representative Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts). Both demanded answers about why Apple collects the data, how it’s generated, whether users can disable the location logging and so on.Neither Apple nor Google have publicly acknowledged Franken’s call for a hearing just yet, and the companies did not respond to our request for comment by publication time. It’s in both of the companies’ better interest to attend, though, lest they want the DOJ, FTC, CDT and others to begin making plans for possible legislation without them.Photo: An unencrypted file stored in iPhones and iPads constantly records a user’s location data. An open source application was used to plot the location data from an iPhone belonging to a Wired.com reporter.

After nearly a decade of rumors and speculation, Apple's finally unveiled the iPad. It's a half-inch thick and weighs just 1.5 pounds, with a 9.7-inch capacitive touchscreen IPS LCD display, and it's running a custom 1GHz Apple "A4" chip developed by the P.A. Semi team, with a 10-hour battery life and a month of standby. It'll come in 16, 32, and 64GB sizes, and it's got the expected connectivity: very little. There's a 30-pin Dock connector, a speaker, a microphone, Bluetooth, 802.11n WiFi and optional 3G, as well as an accelerometer and a compass. There's also a keyboard dock , which connects underneath in the portrait orientation, support for up to 1024x768 VGA out and 480p composite out through new dock adapter cables, and a camera attachment kit that lets you import photos from your camera over USB or directly through an SD reader. The device is managed by iTunes, just like the iPhone -- you sync everything over to your Mac. As expected, it can run iPhone apps -- either pixel-for-pixel in a window, or pixel-doubled fullscreen -- but developers can also target the new screen size using the updated iPhone OS SDK, which is available today. The 3G version runs on AT&T and comes with new data plans : 250MB for $14.99 and an unlimited plan for $29.99 a month contract-free. Activations are handled on the iPad, so you can activate and cancel whenever you want. Every iPad is unlocked and comes with a GSM "micro-SIM," so you can use it abroad, but there aren't any international deals in place right now -- Steve says they'll be back "this summer" with news on that front. It starts at $499 for 16GB, 32GB for $599, and $699 64GB. Adding 3G costs a $130 per model, so the most expensive model (64GB / 3G) is $829. The WiFi-only model will ship in 60 days, and the 3G models will come in 90.

If you didn't already think your smartphone knows too much about you, here's a handy reminder. A duo of UK researchers have uncovered a potentially worrying (and oddly enough, undocumented) feature in iOS 4 : it asks your iPhone to record your location constantly, then timestamps that data and records it for posterity. The trouble with this unsolicited location tracking is that the hidden file that holds the data -- consolidated.db -- is relatively easy to uncover and read, making any desktops you've backed your phone up to and the phone itself even bigger privacy dangers than they would usually be. Some extra digging revealed this behavior has been known about for a good while (see Courbis and Alex Levinson links below), though mostly by people involved in computer forensics. Additionally, restoring a backup or migrating to a new device keeps the data logging going, which the researchers point to as evidence that what's happening isn't accidental. See a couple of visualizations of the extracted results on video after the break. [Thanks, Tom]The original text of this article was updated to reflect that this was already a known issue, albeit in limited circles. The ability to easily visualize the data is new.

Facebook's slick new camera app goes on strike if you don't give it access to your location. Here's why.Since Facebook released its new "Camera" mobile app yesterday, there's been speculation as to why the social network would buy Instagram and then release its own very similar app. There's been even more curiosity about why the new app has such an interest in where you are while using it.As users have noticed, the Camera app requires iOS' Location Services to be turned on so it can access your locally stored photos, and the app won't let you upload a shot if you simply deny it location access from the get-go.According to software developerJoshua Debner, who pinged BuzzFeed, about the behavior, the location services requirement is "an iOS limitation in order to be able to multiselect. Otherwise you would have had to pick one photo at a time..."That feature is what currently separates the Facebook Camera app from the photo uploading feature in Facebook's usual iPhone and iPad app. There you can only upload one shot at a time.iOS and Android app Gifboom uses the same API, and has its own explainer on the matter:In Facebook's case, the standalone Camera app can use that location information to let other users know where you were when you took the photo, but it isn't on by default.CNET's Bridget Carey received confirmation that you can use the app even if you're concerned by giving it access to your location. The work around: Just make sure that when you take photos with the iPhone camera, you've turned off location permissions. No GPS data is then attached to your photos. Then you can go into Facebook Camera and upload them location-free.iOS Location Services is turned on by default, but it can be disabled in the device settings, and users can choose which apps are allowed to access Location Settings. Also, while it will be little comfort to those truly paranoid about location privacy, users of the app can choose whether to share a photo's location data when posting it to Facebook.Updated at 5:24 p.m. PT to clarify how iOS handles location with additional background.

The iPhone continues to store location data even when location services are disabled, contrary to Apple’s previous claims.The Wall Street Journal did independent testing on an iPhone and found that even after turning off location services, the device was still collecting information on nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points.This discovery challenges some of Apple’s claims. As Wired.com reported last week, the company explained in a detailed letter last year that it deliberately collects geodata to store in a comprehensive location database to improve location services. In the letter, Apple noted that customers can disable location-data collection by turning off Location Services in the settings menu.“If customers toggle the switch to ‘Off,’ they may not use location-based services, and no location-based information will be collected,” Apple said in the letter (.pdf).That doesn’t appear to be the case from WSJ‘s testing, as well as multiple independent reports from customers who had the same results.The controversy surrounding Apple’s location-tracking stems from a discovery by two data scientists, who found that a file stored on iPhones and iPads (“consolidated.db”) contains a detailed history of geodata accompanied with time stamps.Apple claimed in its letter last year that the geodata is stored on the device, then anonymized and transmitted back to Apple every 12 hours, using a secure Wi-Fi connection (if one is available).Although it’s thorough, Apple’s explanation does not address why the stored geodata continues to live on the device permanently after it’s transmitted to Apple, nor does it address why geodata collection appears to persist even when Location Services is turned off.Google does similar geodata collection for its own location-services database. However, it notifies Android users clearly in a prompt when geodata collection will occur, and it also gives users a way to opt out. Also, Android devices do not permanently store geodata after transmitting it to Google.Meanwhile, a MacRumors.com reader claims he sent an e-mail to CEO Steve Jobs asking him to explain why Apple tracks geodata, threatening to switch to an Android device.“Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a Droid,” the reader wrote. “They don’t track me.”The CEO shot back a terse reply, defending his company and attacking his competitor Google, according to the reader: “Oh yes they do. We don’t track anyone. The info circulating around is false.”Apple has not commented on the authenticity of the e-mail.The purported e-mail is similar in nature to many e-mails that Jobs has sent to customers in the past: It’s concise and still manages to pull off some word play. Jobs would be accurate to claim that Apple is not tracking customers directly — but instead it is using iPhones to gather information about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi stations, occasionally combined with GPS data. In other words, Apple is tracking geodata from mobile devices, as Google is also doing.Apple has not commented on the location-tracking issue since the story broke last week.While the collected geodata doesn’t reveal specific addresses for locations you’ve visited, it can still leave a pretty rich trail of a user’s movements. Combine this data with other pieces of information on the iPhone, like your messages and photos, and you’ve got a device that knows more about you than you do yourself, says The Atlantic‘s Alexis Madrigal.Madrigal tested an iPhone forensics program called Lantern, which stitches together contacts, text messages and geodata into a neat interface that reconstructed a timeline of his life.“Immediately after trying out Lantern, I enabled the iPhone’s passcode and set it to erase all data on the phone,” Madrigal said. “This thing remembers more about where I’ve been and what I’ve said than I do, and I’m damn sure I don’t want it falling into anyone’s hands.”

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple's new iPhone doesn't seem to like being touched much, and the beautiful (if easily discoloured) screen scratches too. Dear dear.To be fair, the scratching issue only affects the more-clumsy user, and there are only a couple of reports about discolouration in the corner of the screen, but it seems that the majority of iPhone 4s do have an aversion to being touched as sticky fingers are causing huge drops in signal strength.The problem was first noted by a reader on the MacRumors forum who provided a demonstration video:Since then tech blog Gizmodo has been canvassing early-adopters and accumulated a bundle of examples showing, in almost every case, that touching the bottom of the phone leads to around three bars being dropped off the indicated signal strength (which runs up to five).Even worse, a speed test performed by one reader demonstrated the download connection dropped to less than a third (from 840Kb/sec to 263Kb/sec) when they picked up the phone, a drop which could be slightly mitigated through the use of a leather case.Which brings us to the conspiracy part of the story – unlike previous iPhones, the latest model was launched along with accessories including the "bump case", which (it appears) would provide enough separation to improve the signal significantly. A deliberate plan by Apple seems a stretch to us, but it's hard to see how such a widespread problem got missed during development.Radio modelling can get very complicated, and the plethora of radios and frequencies used by a modern mobile phone adds to that complexity. In the past companies such as Nokia were able to leverage their vast experience with radio to create phones that just worked better than the competition. More recently the commoditisation of the radio component has enabled lots more players to create acceptable kit, though it seems in this case Apple may have tripped up.A few users may be seeing discolouration in the corners of their iPhone 4 screens (as reported by CNet), and some will manage to scratch them too (also reported by CNet), but the killer application for a mobile phone remains the ability to make phone calls, and it seems possible that in all the excitement Apple has forgotten that. ®

"While he agreed that the app doesn't technically break the rules, he said that it does encroach upon the boundaries of what they can and cannot allow on their store. He also cited security concerns."Can't say we're surprised to hear that Apple rejected Greg Hughes' Wi-Fi Sync app . You know, the app that allows you to wirelessly sync your iPhone / iPod touch with iTunes without having to USB tether to your computer. Messing with Apple's synchronization technology is a pretty big no-no as demonstrated by Palm's webOS bluff . Here's the rejection as explained by Greg from an unnamed Apple rep over the phone: So while you won't find it in Apple's App Store, it's available now on Cydia for a cool $9.99. You have jailbroken your device haven't you? Don't make us get all MuscleNerd up in here.: An Apple spokeswoman contacted us to clarify that the rejection was the result of security issues and "technical issues including reading and writing outside of the app's container." So there.

In light of the recent update in the developer's agreement for the iPhone, countless discussions have appeared on the internet which follow the same beaten path of such conversations.Namely, they boil down to somebody saying someting along these lines:"It's Steve Job's company, and he has every right to do whatever he wants with it. He sets up the rules. If you don't like the rules, don't buy his products, don't bitch about it on the forums".This point is incorrect for many reasons, one of them being that if you don't like people bitching about anything, you are just as free to not read it. However, that's not the reason I am going to talk about. The reason I will talk about is this:*Doing so does not make sense from an economic point of view. *All these assumptions are false. First of all, it is rarely the case that there exists a product on the market that has all the feature any particular customer wants. For that matter, one can desire a product that, in fact, is an iPhone with feature X on it.Secondly, the argument assumes that one can just go and buy a new piece of technology at any time, even if there is a product that satisfies the requirements. Not all people have the budget to switch. Some are tied by other factors (e.g. people who actually want an iPhone might be deterred by AT&T). Some people purhcased a product before a better one appeared on the market.Thirdly, simply buying a competitor's product doesn't work if only a minority of its users are not satisfied. As long as the decrease in the influx of customers is a smaller loss than the cost of adding a feature (think Fight Club!).More importantly, a person who bought an iPhone, didn't like it and switched is not a loss for Apple if the said person is silent about it. This brings us to the fourth point: that's exactly what Apple would want you to do: they would rather lose customers than have complaining customers. This is why the phones are locked and the App store is insanely restrictive, in spite of potential loss of customers that it brings.So, as a consumer who is unhappy about X on the iPhone, what are you to do?You are to bitch about it, loudly and publicly. You are to scream in all forums about how X makes your life miserable, and how iPhone is not good without X. You are to say that you are going to switch to an Android phone next month because X on the iPhone makes it unusable for everybody. Make a "Top 5 reasons why you shouldn't own an iPhone" on your blog ("Top 10" if you own one), with X being the No. 1 reason.In short, you are to make a person about to buy an iPhone reconsider doing it because of X.So, you are to make some bad publicity for Apple. Bad publicity is always a loss for a company, and it's a loss that is noticeable to shareholders. In this day and age, even a blog post can go far. And if you scare the shareholders, even Steve Jobs will have to abide. And if Apple still keeps its course in spite of your efforts, you still win by strengthening the competition, who (if smart) might even make a product for you that is good and has X.tl;dr: if you want a feature X on a platform, bitching about X en masse is an effective way to hurt the company just enough for it to provide X for you. So, Bitching is a good negative reinforcement.

The Michigan man behind a massive iPod repair and return scam will soon be thinking about his actions in a jail cell. Twenty-three-year-old Nicholas Woodhams, also known as the "iPod Mechanic," was sentenced to 13 months in prison this week after pleading guilty to mail fraud and money laundering charges earlier this year. In addition to jail time, Woodhams was ordered to pay $648,568 in restitution to Apple as well as $8,066.85 to the US Postal Service, according to the US Attorney General's Office.Apple filed a lawsuit against Woodhams in July of 2008 for defrauding the company out of numerous iPod shuffles and other iPod repairs. The company accused Woodhams of exploiting Apple's advance replacement system for the iPod shuffle, reselling the new devices through his own website. Additionally, Woodhams exploited Apple's iPod Warranty Service Program to get repairs on iPods that were out of warranty. Less than a year later, prosecutors in Michigan filed criminal charges against Woodhams, alleging that he committed fraud and laundered money as a part of his scam.In April of this year, Woodhams must have been scared enough to try and come up with a plea bargain, admitting that he was guilty for the criminal charges. That brings us to where we are today: Woodhams was sentenced by US District Judge Robert Holmes Bell to prison time plus restitution on Tuesday of this week. In addition to all of the above, Woodhams was also forced to forfeit about $750,000 worth of ill-gotten gains, including a house in Michigan, an Audi S4, an Ariel Atom 2, a Honda motorcycle, and more than half a million dollars in cold, hard cash.For those keeping track, that's a grand total of about $1,406,634.85 (or so) that Woodhams will be forking over to everyone involved. For someone who is only 23, that's a hefty price to pay for what originated as an easy way to make a buck on the Internet.

The Samsung Galaxy S3 is outselling the iPhone 5 despite Apple's hugely hyped launch, according to new figures.Comparison site uSwitch says the S3 outsold the iPhone on deals from British phone networks in September, but the figures don't include any phones sold SIM-free. Despite the huge hype around its launch, the iPhone 5 arrives at -- appropriately enough -- number five with a bullet on the uSwitch hotlist.Although the iPhone went on sale in shops on 21 September, it was available to order online from the 14th. While that means it was on sale for less time than other phones, the first few days often see the fastest sales, like the opening weekend of a movie. As queues formed outside Apple Stores days in advance, the iPhone 5 ended up shifting 5 million phones globally in the first three days -- beating the previous model's first month of sales. So we'd expect the iPhone to have a stellar fortnight.By contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S3 has been on sale since May, so you'd expect sales to have slowed, but with five months at the top is clearly still selling like heated comestibles. The iPhone was also outsold by the Samsung Galaxy Ace and the older Galaxy S2, and the iPhone 4S, showing that many phone fans would rather bag a bargain on an older phone than splash out on the latest iPhone.The Mobile Tracker report is based on figures derived from uSwitch and its network of mobile phone comparison partners, so doesn't include those buying unlocked iPhones direct from Apple -- or indeed any other SIM-free phone.If you're considering buying a new iPhone, check out our iPhone comparison guide to save oodles of boodle.Have you bought a new phone in the last month? Did you opt for a new phone or bag a bargain? Tell me your thoughts in the comments or on our Facebook page.

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

Apple rushed to file a last minute request with the court to stop Samsung from making public a series of sensitive sales data documents related to the iPhone and iPad when it cross examines Philip Schiller, Apple?s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, later today.The judge presiding over the patent case between Apple and Samsung has worked to keep the closely watched trial, and all related evidence, as transparently open as possible, but has allowed both parties to argue in support of sealing specific, confidential evidence on a case-by-case basis. In addition to sales and marketing data, Apple's various motions to keep evidence private and confidential have also included iOS source code, which the company holds to be particularly sensitive. Apple has most recently filed two motions related to eight confidential trial exhibits of sales data, which the company's attorneys described as "a particularized, document-by-document showing of good cause and compelling reasons for sealing of Apple?s most competitively sensitive information." The motions included "declarations from several of its executives attesting to the value of this information, the efforts Apple has undertaken to maintain its secrecy, and the harm that Apple would suffer if it were publicly disclosed." Apple stated that it had originally filed a motion last week to seal four documents Samsung had said it would use during Schiller's cross examination scheduled for today, but added four more after being notified last night after 9 PM by Samsung that it planned to use another four. The documents in question include iPhone, iPad and iPod touch sales summaries, an iPad tracking study, and a series of quarterly iPhone buyer surveys conducted over the past two years. Apple also objected to Samsung's last minute surprise notification of the additional documents it planned to present today, but asked the court that "only excerpted portions of those documents be entered into evidence" if it decided to allow the late filings. The iPhone maker has proposed using excerpted versions of various sales report and other documents it holds to be confidential, putting only a few specific, relevant pages of the hundreds of pages of the documents in question into evidence in a manner than would become part of the public record. Apple argued that this "would lessen the burdens on the jury and the Court and would balance the public interest in access to court records and Apple?s interest in maintaining secrecy of its valuable trade secrets," but noted that it was "unable to reach agreement" with Samsung on the matter. In response to Apple's motion, US District Court Judge Lucy Koh ordered that two exhibits on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch sales summaries would be sealed in part with the redactions Apple requested earlier in the week, and that only the relevant pages of two studies Samsung plans to question Schiller about will be entered into evidence. The additional four documents Samsung announced it would use today "shall not be used in the examination of Mr. Schiller as they were not timely disclosed," the judge wrote in her response to the motion.

This one’s nuts. Remember how there were no police reports about the missing iPhone 5 prototype, even though CNet reported that police offices had actually searched a man’s house looking for it? The guy whose home was searched in search of that lost iPhone 5 prototype says the officials weren’t actually police officers… they were Apple employees impersonating them.The implication is that the officials, who appear to be members of Apple’s security team, were impersonating police, a crime punishable by up to a year in jail in California.In July, an iPhone 5 prototype was purportedly lost in Cava 22, a San Francisco bar. Shortly after, the home of Sergio Calderón, 22, of Bernal Heights in San Francisco, was searched by six officials claiming to be police. They had traced the missing iPhone 5 prototype to his home using GPS.But now it appears that the six officials — four men and two women, all wearing badges of some kind — weren’t SFPD, but part of Apple’s security team. A phone number given to Calderón by one of the men who identified himself as “Tony,” belongs to Anthony Colon, a former San Jose Police sergeant who is employed as a “senior investigator” at Apple (LinkedIn profile).“This is something that’s going to need to be investigated now,” SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfield said, when informed about the Bernal Heights man’s statements to SF Weekly. “If this guy is saying that the people said they were SFPD, that’s a big deal.”The story of the lost prototype was reported by CNet earlier this week, citing an unnamed source. However, SFPD has no record of the case and when we visited the bar where the phone was supposedly lost, the manager knew nothing about it.Here’s a picture of Anthony Colon and a screenshot of his LinkedIn profile, which has now been removed:

One of our very close AT&T sources just sent us in these images. Yes, it’s a fried iPhone 4. Apparently a customer brought the phone into the store to try and get help with it, although it’s pretty evident that the phone is unrepairable. It’s the first time our guy has seen this happen (us too), but the brand new iPhone 4 caught on fire while being hooked up to a computer using the Apple USB cable that accompanied the device. The customer wanted to exchange the iPhone — obviously — for a new, non-charred unit however the AT&T store in question was out of stock. An Apple Store did confirm to our AT&T connection that this did appear to be a defective USB port and not some sort of user error. Our source went onto say that the phone bezel was extremely hot (obviously), and it slightly burned the customers hand. The USB port in the phone was slightly melted and the cord was badly melted (as is apparent in the pictures). Hopefully this is the only time we see our beloved iPhones meet a fiery death. We’ve got one more picture for you after the break.

The employer of the spouse of my enemy's lawyerApple's billion dollar patent court victory should be dismissed, Samsung say, because the jury foreman in the case was biased. Samsung's call for a retrial in the fight between the two tech giants will be heard on 6th December by judge Lucy Koh in the same San Jose court where the original verdict was handed down.New information about the Jury Foreman Velvin Hogan taints the jury verdict, Samsung says. Hogan did not reveal to the court that he was bankrupted following a lawsuit against a company in which Samsung is now a shareholder. Hogan was sued by his former employer Seagate Technologies in 1993 and filed for bankruptcy. As of 2011 Samsung have owned a chunk of Seagate shares, in exchange for selling the storage company their HDD business.Sammie have asked Apple to disclose when these two facts became known to Apple.Apple has rejected all the charges in a counter-motion, describing Samsung's argument as a "convoluted theory", and throwing scorn on the idea that Hogan would try to "exact revenge" on a Seagate shareholder and the spouse of a lawyer who had acted against him 19 years ago.Samsung’s theory fails on the merits because the decades-old Seagate dispute has nothing to do with this case and would not have supported challenge for cause, and Samsung has not shown that Mr. Hogan’s responses were “dishonest” and “material,” as Supreme Court precedent requires.Apple have added that it was up to Samsung's lawyers to quiz and approve jury members before the trial.Koh said yesterday that she would hear the arguments on the 6th December. ®APPLE, INC. v.

Apple says terrorists could use iPhones to attack cell phone towersApple has tried everything to stop iPhone unlockers.  Bricking iPhones didn't work -- it just generated more headaches and bad PR.  Apple's internal protection technology turned out to be just as weak and poorly implemented as its consumer security on the iPhone -- the hackers quickly overcame the latest protections Apple threw at them.  Now with its shiny new iPhone 3G S becoming yet the latest handset to be freed, Apple has turned to none other than the U.S. government for help. The company has submit a report to the U.S. Copyright Office suggesting that iPhone unlocking be outlawed (and jailbreaking from the AT&T network, essentially as well as it would be impossible without unlocking) as Apple claims it threatens cell phone towers across America.  Apple claims that unlocking the iPhone provides easy access to the iPhone’s BBP — the “baseband processor” software, which enables a connection to cell phone towers. According to Apple, the BBP could then be exploited by "a local or international hacker could potentially initiate commands (such as a denial of service attack) that could crash the tower software, rendering the tower entirely inoperable to process calls or transmit data." States Apple, "Taking control of the BBP software would be much the equivalent of getting inside the firewall of a corporate computer — to potentially catastrophic result.  The technological protection measures were designed into the iPhone precisely to prevent these kinds of pernicious activities, and if granted, the jailbreaking exemption would open the door to them." Currently, iPhone unlocking falls under a legal gray zone.  The comments by Apple come in response to an ongoing request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to legalize the widespread practice of unlocking.  Apple wants to push it in the other direction make unlocking and jailbreaking the phone illegal. Fred von Lohmann, the EFF attorney in charge of the EFF request mocked Apple's filing openly, calling its claims "preposterous".  He says that there's an estimated 1 million unlocked iPhones operating in the U.S. and that they have posed no threat thus far.  He states, "As far as I know, nothing like that has ever happened.  This kind of theoretical threat is more FUD than truth." Apple also claims that unlocking and jailbreaking also could be used to enable the alteration of the Exclusive Chip Identification number, allowing for anonymous phone calls.  States Apple, "This would be desirable to drug dealers." Unlocking the iPhone may currently be banned under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which states that "no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title." However, citizen requests, such as the EFF filing, must be considered for exemption every three years.  The Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office is tasked with that responsibility.

Motorola targets young men with its most testosterone-heavy TV commercial yetSomeone had fun writing this ad copy:Droid. Should a phone be pretty? Should it be a tiara-wearing digitally clueless beauty pageant queen? Or should it be fast? Racehorse duct-taped to a Scud missile fast. We say the latter. So we built the phone that does. Does rip through the Web like a circular saw through a ripe banana. Is it a precious porcelain figurine of a phone? In truth? No. It's not a princess. It's a robot. A phone that trades hair-do for can-do.The new Droid commercial that debuted in prime-time Thursday night (and is pasted below the fold) opened a new front in Motorola (MOT) and Verizon's (VZ) $100 million ad campaign to take market share from Apple's (AAPL) iPhoneEarlier commercials had appealed to the fragile male ego with icons of masculinity: stealth bombers, heavyweight fighters, rock-crushing machinery.This one goes after the competition by painting it -- and its users -- as effeminate.It's a strategy as old as the schoolyard, and it seems to be working -- at least on one side of the yard. A new YouGov BrandIndex survey taken Thursday shows Motorola's buzz rising relative to Apple's and Research in Motion's (RIMM) among men 18 and older. And the company seems to be on track in its stated goal of selling 1 million Droids by New Years.It remains to be seen whether it has burned its bridges to the other half of the market in the process.

Steve Jobs has responded to the mounting questions about iPhones collecting location data for up to a year - a revelation that could lead to privacy investigations by some European governments.In a characteristically terse email, apparently sent directly from his iPhone, the Apple chief executive - who is officially on medical leave from his company, and has been seen only briefly in public since January - insisted that "we don't track anyone", and instead aimed his ire at Google, claiming that "they do" track users.The exchange, documented by a reader of the MacRumors website who emailed Jobs (whose address is well-known online), appears to be legitimate. Apple has not commented on its provenance.Could you please explain the necessity of the passive location-tracking tool embedded in my iPhone? It's kind of unnerving knowing that my exact location is being recorded at all times. Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a [Google Android] Droid. They don't track me.Oh yes they do. We don't track anyone. The info circulating around is false.While it is certainly true that Android phones do gather anonymised location information, Google has insisted that the collection is opt-in, with a clear dialogue which the user is presented with before proceeding. In addition, Google's system only retains the most recent 50 mobile cell masts and 200 Wi-Fi networks seen, and in a form that is hard to access. By contrast Apple's seems to collect an almost unlimited amount in a form which is easily accessible to anyone who gets their hands on the phone.Apple has also confirmed to the US Congress that iPhones and iPads collect location data when permitted by the user, and buried in the lengthy license document for the iTunes Store (used to synchronise data) is an 86-word paragraph which gives the company the right to access location data collected by the user.However the data is all anonymised, with no personal details of the user or physical addresses for the phone.Jobs's claim that "we don't track anyone" is arguably true, in that Apple could not target named individuals. However the benefits of the location-tracking services to targeted advertising based on whether a phone is being used are clear to both Apple and Google.Jobs's assertion that "The info circulating around is false" is hard to analyse, given that he does not say which information he is referring to. But hundreds of people have posted maps online showing how their iPhone or iPad has tracked their movements.

With Android getting all Flash-ey , Apple's "Goldilocks" position on Flash -- the full Flash player is too hefty, Flash Lite is too weak -- seemed pretty untenable. Now Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen has revealed that Apple and Adobe are "collaborating" on making Flash a reality on the iPhone, citing the technical challenge it presents. What's clear is that with all this work to do, it doesn't seem they're going the watered-down Flash Lite route, but we're trying not to hold our breath for a full-on, Hulu-friendly version that will finally help us get that Doogie Howser fix on the go. Naturally, there's no word on when this will hit.[Via AppleInsider

It might be a cliche, but sometimes, a picture says more than a thousand words. Over the years, I've often talked about how the technology world is iterative, about how products are virtually always built upon that which came before, about how almost always, multiple people independently arrive at the same products since they work within the same constraints of the current state of technology. This elementary aspect of the technology world, which some would rather forget, has been illustrated very, very well in one of Samsung's legal filings against AppleThis is what Samsung was considering putting to market in the summer of 2006, six months before the unveiling of the iPhone.One of these phones (the bottom-right one) became the Samsung F700 - a product Apple once included as an infringing product, but later withdrew once it learned Samsung created it and brought it to market before the iPhoneIt extends to more than just the hardware - Samsung was also working on interfaces that looks remarkably like iOS (actually, that look remarkably like PalmOS) - in the summer and fall of 2006. Again, before the iPhone was released.The most damning and interesting graphic is one of those 'before-after-the-iPhone'-ones. In it, Samsung quite effectively demonstrates that its phones - like the Galaxy line - are clearly descendant from Samsung's pre-iPhone designs, and not from the iPhone.Seems like an open and shut case to me. Samsung didn't have to look very far for prior art - it created it itself. Doesn't that just boggle the mind? Samsung is being accused of stealing, even thought the company was clearly working on what it supposedly stole before the iPhone was even released. Samsung's phones bear more resemblance to its own pre-iPhone designs than to the iPhone, yet Apple and its supporters still insist Samsung is a thief.All this reminds me a lot of the early '80s and the development of the graphical user interface (a process I prefer to divide up into generations). The 'invention' of the GUI was a very long process, which, in my view, started with Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad (1st generation GUI), and ended with the work done at Xerox (3rd generation GUI). I say 'ended' because even though some people are easily fooled by fancier graphics and swapping a mouse for a finger, every device we own still employs what is essentially Xerox' interface.Xerox didn't realise they were sitting on a revolution, so other companies swooped in and created the 4th generation of GUIs; Apple, Amiga, and Digital Research (GEM) all developed a fourth generation GUI simultaneously in pretty much the same timespan. However, these days, many people just give all the credit to Apple and be done with it.Apple acts as if the iPhone was developed in a vacuum, and wants the world to believe that it, and only it, invented the concept of a touchscreen phone. With that nonsensical idea, the company not only ignores the long history of mobile computing (specifically PalmOS which is iOS' and Android's common ancestor), but also the fact that other companies were working on touchscreen phones at the same time (LG Prada, these Samsung images).Apple wants to rewrite history. As a geek, I find that incredibly offensive.

When you see people flipping through e-books on iPads or iPhones, there is a good chance they bought the books through Amazon.com, not Apple.Now, Apple wants to change that.Apple confirmed Tuesday that it would require app developers that sell e-books outside of their iPad and iPhone apps — through a Web site, for example — to also sell the books inside those apps. And purchases that originate in the app must be made through Apple, which keeps a 30 percent cut.Apple said it was newly enforcing an existing rule, one that will force Amazon, Sony, Google and other e-book sellers to change the way their apps work.“We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app,” Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.Amazon makes Kindle reading apps for the iPad and iPhone, and those apps now send readers to a Web browser window to make book purchases from Amazon, dodging the Apple fee. Sony said on Monday that Apple had rejected its reading app, which worked the same way.The move is surprising because Apple has benefited from the wealth of content available for its devices, said Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, a consultant to book publishers.“Most of the people reading on the iPad are buying their books from these other people, and that’s a great thing for Apple,” Mr. Shatzkin said. “It’s selling tons of devices for Apple and tons of content for everybody else.”It is highly unlikely that Amazon, Sony or others will be willing to share e-book revenue or customer information with its competitor, Apple, which sells its own e-books in its iBookstore.Steve Haber, president of Sony’s digital reading business, said that Sony was working on “different ways to bring content to Apple devices,” though he declined to elaborate on what those are.For now, Apple has said only that it is applying the rule to e-books. But other apps give customers the ability to make outside purchases, so it could potentially apply to apps that sell movies, magazines, music or virtual goods in games as well. Apple declined to comment on whether the rule applied to apps other than e-readers.

AT&T’s Ralph de la Vega this morning said the carrier either has to “reduce or modify” the mobile data consumption of some of its high-end users. Which could mean the end of flat-rate pricing in favor of prices that vary based on network congestion.AT&T’s Ralph de la Vega used today’s UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York to deliver a message to the carrier’s data-hungry mobile users: We will have ways of modifying — or monetizing — your behavior.Noting that roughly 3 percent of AT&T users generate 40 percent of the traffic on the network, de la Vega spoke of offering “incentives” to get users to curb their data habits. Those “incentives,” though, may come in the form of stiffer fees or higher changes for downloading information during business hours — what’s known as congestion pricing for mobile broadband.“I’m not going to give you in detail what we’re going to do, but if three are causing 40 percent, then we’re going to try to focus on making sure we give incentives to those small percentages to either reduce or modify their usage so they don’t crowd out the other users in those same cell sites,” de la Vega said. “You’ll see us address that more in detail in the future…What’s driving usage on the network and driving these high-usage situations are things like video or audio that keeps playing around the clock. We’ve got to get to those customers and have them recognize and change their patterns.”As Stacey wrote a few months ago (GigaOM Pro, sub. required), a combination of attractive price plans, high-quality smartphones and the rise of mobile applications are already driving mobile broadband usage — in a big way. Much of the traffic is due to streaming content such as web-based video and on-the-go music services that require far more bandwidth than things like text messaging and mobile e-mail. And that consumption will surely continue to surge as netbooks and a flood of other connected devices come to market, and as the fatter pipes of LTE make accessing content even easier and faster.Indeed, de la Vega this morning said that simply boosting capacity on AT&T’s 850 Mhz network in New York resulted in an “overnight” traffic increase of 30 percent. AT&T’s woes are a prime example of network shortcomings, to be sure, and the carrier is scrambling to appease data-hungry users by upgrading its 3G network to HSPAen route to the 4G technology LTE. But other operators are certain to experience such growing pains as they grow their data businesses with iPhone-like handsets.Carriers are increasingly turning to technologies like Wi-Fi and femtocells to help offload the increasing traffic, but operators will likely also abandon their flat-rate pricing models in favor of congestion pricing. A consumer who uses mobile data primarily for email on the phone, for instance, could opt for 200kbps service while a netbook-toting road warrior could be asked to shell out for a 1.5Mbps connection. And connectivity could vary not just by user but also by use case, giving consumers the flexibility to pay more when they need a lot of data quickly or during peak hours. Cable operators and a handful of European ISPs are already toying with such models.Congestion pricing has some substantial drawbacks, of course. Charging consumers based on a host of variables is a marketing strategy destined to foster confusion in the minds of users, and it could force carriers to make upgrades to billing infrastructures to ensure users are billed accurately. But with mobile data already straining the capacity of some operators’ networks, it’s a model you may see sooner than you expect.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is refuting a statement made by members of AntiSec this weekend that they hacked the laptop of an FBI special agent and stole a file containing 12 million Apple device IDs and associated personal information.The FBI also said it did not possess a file containing the data the hackers said they stole.In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the FBI said, “The FBI is aware of published reports alleging that an FBI laptop was compromised and private data regarding Apple UDIDs was exposed. At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data.”In case that wasn’t emphatic enough, the FBI also tweeted:Over the weekend, the hacker group AntiSec released an encrypted file that containing 1 million Apple device IDs and device names that the group said was obtained from an FBI computer they hacked.The hackers said the original file contained 12 million IDs, including personal information, but they released only 1 million (leaving out the personal data) in an encrypted file published on torrent sites.In a lengthy post online, the hackers wrote that last March, they hacked a laptop belonging to an FBI agent named Christopher K. Stangl from the bureau’s Regional Cyber Action Team and the New York FBI office’s Evidence Response Team.The hackers say the IDs were stored in a file on Stangl’s desktop titled “NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv.”The file, according to the hackers, contained a list of more than 12 million Apple iOS devices, including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, names of devices, types of devices, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, ZIP codes, cellphone numbers, and addresses.The hackers suggested in a tweet from the @AnonymousIRC account that the FBI was using the information to track users.But the FBI disputes this. The FBI did not say whether the NCFTA, which was allegedly referred to in the file name the hackers obtained, possessed the data.NCFTA refers to the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance. The NCFTA is a non-profit that was founded in 1997 by FBI agent Dan Larkin as a conduit between private industry and law enforcement agencies to help them exchange data and cooperate on cases.The organization’s members include financial institutions, telecommunications firms, ISPs, and other private industries.The NCFTA did not respond to a call seeking comment.Apple UDIDs are a 40-character alphanumeric string that is unique to each Apple device.The hackers say they released the Apple UDIDs so that people would know that the FBI may be tracking their devices and also because, they wrote in their online post, “we think it’s the right moment to release this knowing that Apple is looking for alternatives for those UDID currently … but well, in this case it’s too late for those concerned owners on the list.”Apple has been criticized for hard-coding the IDs in devices, since they can be misused by application developers and others to identify a user, when combined with other information, and track them. Last April, Apple began rejecting applications that track UDIDs.The Next Web has created a tool for users to check if their Apple UDID is among those that the hackers released.Update 9.6.12: Apple, which had initially declined to comment on the story, released a statement after the FBI released its statement. According to Apple, “The FBI has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization. Additionally, with iOS 6 we introduced a new set of APIs meant to replace the use of the UDID and will soon be banning the use of UDID.”

Free whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureThe EU is readying a new set of directives that could spell trouble for Apple's iPhone and any other gadget that lacks an easily removable power pack.A new, draft batteries directive mandates that power cells inside electronic devices must be "readily removable" for replacement and safe disposal. This isn't the case with the iPhone, which does not have a user-replaceable battery.Under the terms of the directive, by 2012, at least 25 per cent of all portable batteries - including mobile phone, laptop and car batteries - used annually in each member state must be recycled. By 2016, 45 per cent of them have to be.Mercury, lead and cadmium are by far the most challenging substances in the battery waste stream, the EU says.Although finer details of the removable-battery mandate have not yet been defined - is it sufficient for the supplier to be able to remove a product's battery? - Gary Nevison of Leeds-based repair services company Premier Farnell believes the requirement is "clearly intended to ensure that users can remove batteries by opening a cover by hand or after removal of one or two screws". ®

Samsung appears to have become the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, passing Finland's Nokia, top since 1998, as Samsung Electronics reported record first-quarter results.Though the company did not reveal precise numbers, some analysts reckon that it sold more smartphones – 44.5m – in the first three months of the year than Apple's 35.1m for its iPhone. Overall, they calculated that it shipped 93.5m mobile phones, compared with 82.7m for Nokia.Samsung's estimated total gave it a 30.6% share of the smartphone market. Apple's sales gave it a 24.1% share."Samsung and Apple are out-competing most major rivals, and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two-horse race," said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics.Net profit nearly doubled from a year earlier to a record 5.05tn won (£2.75bn) for the quarter to 31 March. Operating profit also hit a record high, at 5.85tn won, which was in line with expectations.Sales rose 22% from a year earlier to 45.3tn won. Shares in the company jumped by 3%. More than 70% of its operating profit came from the mobile business, which saw a surge in sales of its Galaxy smartphones.But Nokia, which has slipped from top place in both mobile phones and smartphones after being passed by both Apple and Samsung, saw its debt marked down a notch by ratings agency Fitch, to BB+ from BBB-. The agency warned that further downgrades could follow.Last week Nokia announced one of its worst quarterly results ever, blaming tough competition for a €929m net loss as sales plunged, especially in the smartphone market. It said it expects no improvement in the second quarter.Analysts could not agree on how many smartphones Samsung shipped because the company only gave relative numbers for revenue and profit compared to the year-ago quarter. Research company IHS Suppli catalogues the Samsung Galaxy Note, with a 5in screen, as a tablet rather than a phone, lowering the total smartphone numbers below Apple's.Samsung's mobile communications division, which makes smartphones and a range of tablets, generated 4.27tn won of operating profit in the quarter after seeing significant sales growth of high-end smartphones in developing markets including China, a key battlefield for mobile phone makers.However Apple's iPhone and iPad business remains more lucrative. The Cupertino, California-based company earned $11.6bn (£7.2bn) in the January-March quarter, more than twice as much as Samsung, even though its revenue was about 10% less.

At PDC 2009, Microsoft demonstrated Silverlight video streaming to an iPhone. While Microsoft user experience platform manager Brian Goldfarb said that Microsoft "worked with Apple" to make it happen, don't expect plug-ins for Mobile Safari to start flooding the App Store. Instead, Microsoft worked to make its IIS7 server software capable of sending an QuickTime-compatible stream to an iPhone embedded with a HTML5 tag.Though Silverlight is more than just a video format—it's more of .NET authoring runtime for web-based applications, much like Flash as become—its media delivery features are what content providers wanted on the iPhone. "The promise of Silverlight is that it's a cross-device, cross-browser, cross-platform solution, and it works the same on Macs as it does on Windows," Goldfarb told BetaNews. "The iPhone is a unique scenario. We talked to our customers...and they said, 'Look, we just need to get our content there, and it's mainly in the media space like broadcasting, and we want to put it on the iPhone.'"The true extent of "working with Apple," though, has more to do with making sure the system would work and that Apple didn't disapprove. "We did all the work," Goldfarb said. "We just made sure Apple was comfortable with it. We have to have a strong partnership with our partners, we have to have trust, and that's key."What Microsoft did was enable IIS Media Services respond to requests from an iPhone and transcode on-demand to H.264 format in an MPEG-2 transport stream, the exact same format used by Apple's proposed HTTP Live Streaming protocol. "So it's the same IIS smooth streaming content, the same server, the same point of origin, but now I can get that content to play without any code changes, without any real work, on the iPhone," Goldfarb explained. "That's the critical thing for our customers."We won't be seeing an Silverlight runtime (nor a Flash one, for that matter) popping up on the iPhone. But content providers already using or considering IIS Media Services won't have to encode video separately or maintain a separate content delivery system for serving their content to the hottest mobile platform. So the real question is, when can I start streaming Netflix to my iPhone?

Apple is making it more difficult for iPhone 4 owners to perform simple DIY repairs by replacing common Phillps head screws with a rare "pentalobe" screws. While newer iPhone 4s have included the screws from the factory, it is also Apple policy to replace any Phillips head screws with the new pentalobe screws whenever an iPhone 4 is taken in for service."This screw head clearly has one purpose," iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens told Ars. "To keep you out."News of the strange screw first started appearing last November, when users began noticing that serviced iPhone 4s had something other than Phillips head screws on them. 9to5Mac originally speculated that the screws were a form of Torx screw common to many Apple devices, but later noted that they were in fact some else entirely.iFixit discovered the odd screws much earlier, as iPhone 4s shipped to Japan on launch had the strange new screw. A little investigation revealed that "it is not a standard Torx, and there are no readily available screwdrivers that can remove it," Wiens said."[Apple] chose this 'pentalobe' fastener specifically because it was new, guaranteeing repair tools would be both rare and expensive," Wiens explained. He also noted that the screws are only used on the exterior of the device, merely to make it difficult for end users to get inside. "Otherwise," Wiens said, "Apple would use it throughout each device."Wiens said that Apple had used a similar screw on early unibody MacBook Pros to secure the integrated battery, but later adopted a tri-wing screw for that purpose. The latest MacBook Airs, however, also use pentalobe screws on the outside case, making it difficult to perform what would otherwise be a simple swap of the SSD, for instance.iFixit is doing what it can to source screwdrivers to work with the new screws, though it notes that there doesn't appear to be a single reputable supplier that carries the same tools Apple technicians use. The company offers a kit for iPhone 4 owners with a small driver than can remove the pentalobe screws along with replacement Phillips screws and #00 Phillips screwdriver. Wiens notes that the pentalobe driver isn't perfect—"the tip is more star-shaped than "flowery"—but it can remove Apple's pesky replacements and "liberate" your iPhone.For MacBook Air owners, iFixit also offers a "5-point" screwdriver that is also more star-shaped, but can remove the pentalobe screws Apple uses on the exterior case. Wiens told Ars that the larger size of the head means that the driver can also be used to screw the case back together without danger of damage to the screws (unlike the tiny ones used in the iPhone 4)."This is terrible for consumers," Wiens said. "Apple is taking planned obsolescence to the next level."

A watchdog group is calling on Apple to demand improvements from its suppliers ahead of releasing its next iPhone. The group says it's already brought in 35,000 signatures.A new online petition is demanding that Apple clean up its act overseas in time to make its next iPhone "the first ethical iPhone."Watchdog group SumOfUs last week put up a petition asking Apple to "make the iPhone 5 ethically," referring to the company's use of overseas manufacturing from companies such as Foxconn, which have recently come under fire for their working conditions and practices.The petition, which the group says garnered more than 35,000 signatures in its first 24 hours, asks Apple to "overhaul the way its suppliers treat their workers," ahead of the release of its next smartphone, which is expected later this year."Can Apple do this? Absolutely," the petition reads. "According to an anonymous Apple executive quoted in The New York Times, all Apple has to do is demand it, and it'll happen."Overseas manufacturers came under fire last week with a pair of investigative stories published by The New York Times that lambasted Apple for poor worker labor and safety issues in its supplier facilities, as well as using cut-throat business practices that prohibited those manufacturers from making improvements.Apple did not respond to the reports in the press, though an internal memo from Apple CEO Tim Cook that leaked last week argued to employees that "any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us.""If Tim Cook is really offended by these allegations, why isn't he doing anything to fix the problems?" Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, executive director of SumOfUs, asked in a statement. "This is the supply chain he set up as COO--he needs to start taking responsibility, not blaming the messenger."This is the latest in a series of petitions targeting Apple, though it is less product-focused. One that launched early last year called on the company to remove a homophobic application from the App Store, a move that resulted in it getting pulled. Two others just a few months ago took aim at the company for the Siri voice assistant application on the iPhone 4S not being able to direct users towards an abortion clinic, which Apple referred to as a "glitch."

...for your own goodFree whitepaper – Forrester: Prepare For Anywhere, Anytime, Any-Device Engagement with a Stateless Mobile ArchitectureApple has applied for a patent covering an elaborate series of measures to automatically protect iPhone owners from thieves and other unauthorized users. But please withhold the applause.The patent, titled “Systems and Methods for Identifying Unauthorized Users of an Electronic Device,” would also protect Apple against jailbreaks and other unauthorized hacks to the device, which were recently excepted from copyright enforcement.The application, which was filed in February and published Thursday, specifically describes the identification of “hacking, jailbreaking, unlocking, or removal of a SIM card” so that measures can be taken to counter the user. Possible responses include surreptitiously activating the iPhone's camera, geotagging the image and uploading it to a server and transmitting sensitive data to a server and then wiping it from the device.Rest assured that this jailbreaking identification, the application would have us believe, is simply a means of protecting owners from unauthorized users.“Access to sensitive information such as credit card information, social security numbers, banking information, home addresses, or any other delicate information can be prohibited,” the application states. “In some embodiments, the sensitive information can be erased from the electronic device. For example, the sensitive information can be erased directly after an unauthorized user is detected.”But elsewhere, the patent betrays ulterior motives that are considerably more self serving.“An activity that can detect an unauthorized user can be any action that may indicate the electronic device is being tampered with by being, for example, hacked, jailbroken, or unlocked,” the patent continues. “For example, a sudden increase in memory usage of the electronic device can indicate that a hacking program is being run and that an unauthorized user may be using the electronic device.“'Jailbreaking' of an electronic device can generally refer to tampering with the device to allow a user to gain access to digital resources that are normally hidden and protected from users. 'Unlocking' of a cellular phone can generally refer to removing a restriction that 'locks' a cellular phone so it may only be used in specific countries or with specific network providers. Thus, in some embodiments, an unauthorized user can be detected if it is determined that the electronic device is being jailbroken or unlocked.”The application describes plenty of bells and whistles. They include voice-printing of the owner to detect unauthorized users (what could possibly go wrong with that?), activating the accelerometer to detect if thieves are in transit – even a “heartbeat sensor.”Ignoring the possibility that a false positive in Apple's proposed theft protection might activate the spy cam while the user is in the bath, or in the middle of some other intimate moment, this technology seems Orwellian for another reason: It gives Steve jobs and Co. the means to retaliate when iPhones aren't being used in ways Cupertino doesn't expressly permit.But remember, it's for your own good. ®

More Google Android phones were sold during the first quarter of 2010 in the U.S. than iPhones. Customers of Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. carrier in terms of subscribers, can’t buy an iPhone, but they can choose from a wide range of different Google Android smartphones.More handsets sold in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010 were running atop Google’s Android than Apple’s iPhone operating system, according to the latest findings of The NPD Group. Android smartphones accounted for 28 percent of sales; the iPhone, just 21 percent (both still lagged behind Research In Motion’s BlackBerry platform, which was the market leader at 36 percent). So what’s propelling Android past the iPhone?There’s the obvious explanation: Exclusivity on AT&T’s network limits the potential sales for Apple. As Verizon announced on its most recent quarterly earnings call, it has more than 92.8 million subscribers, none of which can buy an iPhone for use on the network — although a recent poll found that a majority of them want one. Enter Google Android phones, whose user interfaces are similar to the iPhone and have access to a growing software store, now estimated at 50,000 applications. Verizon is helping the Android cause, too — it devoted $100 million in advertising muscle to back the Android-powered Motorola Droid.An additional factor is the number of handset choices. By providing its Android operating system to any hardware manufacturer that wants it, Google allows for a near limitless number of handset variances for consumers to choose from. iPhone selection, on the other hand, is akin to choosing the paint color of the old Ford Model T’s that only came in black — you can have any iPhone model you like right now, so long as it’s an iPhone 3G or 3GS.Finally, the many permutations of Android devices offers another advantage — pricing flexibility based on the hardware used and the features offered. The NPD Group cites an average smartphone price of $151 in the first quarter of 2010, roughly half of the $299 price tag for a top-shelf iPhone. Apple offers subsidized models at $99 and $199, but most subsidized Android phone prices top out at $199 and go down from there. The Samsung Behold 2 running Android is currently free with a service plan at T-Mobile, for example. With so many choices, consumers can find Android units for well under $99 these days and can shop around in a greater range of price points.

Verizon has quietly begun throttling the wireless connections of its heaviest data users, the company revealed in a PDF buried on its website (hat tip to BGR). The document explains that Verizon has begun two new network management practices in order to "provide the best experience to our more than 94 million customers," and that they go into effect starting today, February 3.In the document, Verizon says it's using techniques such as caching less data on its network, reducing network capacity, and sizing video "more appropriately" for devices. "While we invest much effort to avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process and while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file as displayed on your device," Verizon writes.The company also insists that the process is content-agnostic—likely to avoid the outrage that came when Comcast began throttling Bit Torrent users. Verizon's PDF points to www.verizonwireless.com/vzwoptimization for a more detailed explanation of its optimization "techniques," but as of this writing, that page remains unavailable on Verizon's site.Along with video compression, Verizon is now reducing data throughput speeds for customers that fall into the five percent of customers who "use an extraordinary amount of data." The throttling could last through the remainder of the current billing cycle and the next one, so those who find their data speeds being held back may end up suffering the consequences for months afterwards."Our proactive management of the Verizon Wireless network is designed to ensure that the remaining 95 percent of data customers aren't negatively affected by the inordinate data consumption of just a few users," the company wrote.The timing for Verizon's new throttling policies is no coincidence; today is also the day the carrier began accepting preorders for the long-awaited Verizon iPhone 4. Verizon will undoubtedly begin to feel the weight of iPhone users' browsing habits when the device becomes available to customers on February 10, just as AT&T did when the iPhone first launched on its network in 2007.It took AT&T years of building out its network to better handle the load, and Verizon knows that it needs to balance things out from the beginning. After all, a study from last July showed that Verizon 3G users gobbled about 25 percent more data than iPhone users did—now that Verizon's about to have its old customers and new iPhone users snarfing down data like no tomorrow, network management has apparently become a bigger priority.Another point of note is Verizon's position on the latest net neutrality rules. The company sued the Federal Communications Commission last month to block the rules from taking effect, even though they are comparatively light on wireless communications. Still, with the decision to throttle heavy data users, Verizon is obeying what's outlined in the FCC rules by making sure the implementation is site- and content-agnostic, as well as by being transparent about its practices. The company knows that the move isn't likely to be popular, so it's trying to offer as much information as it can so that users can understand better what's going on behind the scenes.

IPhone activations at AT&T (T) grew by just 3% in the second quarter this year, and many industry watchers pointed to the flood of next-generation iPhone rumors as a likely culprit for the slowed growth. BGR has exclusively learned that this is not entirely the case, however, and the stalled iPhone sales at the nation’s No.2 wireless carrier may in fact be by design.Updated with official statement from AT&T after the last paragraph.Regional retail sales managers at AT&T have been instructing store managers to pump the brakes on Apple’s iPhone. Instructions handed down from corporate state that customers seeking smartphones at AT&T retail stores should be steered away from Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone and towards Android phones or Windows Phone handsets like the Nokia Lumia 900 instead. BGR has confirmed the directive with three independent sources.Even when customers come into stores specifically looking for the iPhone 4S or iPhone 4, staffers have been instructed to make an effort to show people Android and Windows Phone devices as well, so they can “make an informed decision.” In addition, AT&T retail staff in at least some locations are no longer permitted to obtain iPhones as their company-owned devices, and must instead choose an Android smartphone or a Windows Phone.One source told BGR that Apple’s iPhone used to make up as much as 80% of smartphone sales at stores in his area, but that figure has dropped dramatically to between 50% and 60% since regional managers instructed stores to actively push other smartphones in place of the iPhone.Apple handsets still accounted for 72% of all smartphones activated by AT&T during the second quarter this year.UPDATE: AT&T contacted BGR via email and supplied the following statement:The idea that we would steer any customer away from a particular device couldn’t be more farfetched.  Our reps do what it takes to align customer needs with the best device for them.  iPhone remains one of our most popular devices, which doesn’t happen by steering people away from it. Our reps are encouraged to try all devices so they are more knowledgeable on our industry-leading smartphone lineup.

Google just did what many thought wasn't possible -- it just put mobile Chrome on iOS. Both iPad and iPhone users will get the app, either with incognito browsing, syncing and that unique tabbed browsing interface intact. The company hasn't said what's changed versus the Android build, but it's likely the main differences are matters of integration -- Apple's app rules won't let Google bring in its own WebKit rendering engine tweaks or change the default browser. Whether or not that switch is a dealbreaker, Chrome should be available later today in the App Store for those who want a break from the Safari norm.Check out our full coverage of Google I/O 2012's developer conference at our event hub!Update: No download just yet, but Google is teasing us with a video that you can find after the break.

The UK's Advertising Standards Authority determined today that an Apple TV ad's claims about its iPhone 3G's relative download speeds is misleading and exaggerative, and must be pulled.The ASA received 17 complaints from television viewers who believed Apple's "So what's so great about 3G?" ad for the company's latest iPhone inaccurately portrayed the speed of the iPhone 3G. In the ad, Web pages are loaded in a fraction of a second with a voice-over stating (four times) that news, directions, and the Internet are each "really fast."According to the ASA, this ad violates three sections of the BCAP TV Advertising Code:5.2.1 "Licensees must obtain adequate objective evidence to support all claims ," (in this case, the accuracy of the portrayal of the 3G iPhone's speed.) 5.2.2 " Descriptions, claims and illustrations must not imply attributes, capabilities or performance beyond those that can be achieved in normal use." 5.4.1: "Advertisements must not use any technique that is likely to give a misleading or unfair impression of the product or service."Apple's response was that the ad was clearly comparing the 3G's speed against its 2G predecessor, and that the average viewer, as a mobile phone user, would understand the device's performance would vary. It said it reinforced that understanding by including the on-screen fine print, "Network performance will vary by location."The ASA, however, determined that there was no explicit comparison with the 2G iPhone, and that the visuals in combination with the repeated claim "really fast," was likely to mislead viewers. Therefore, it declared, the ad as seen here must no longer be aired in the UK, and must be altered or retired.

The Consumerist reports that one of its readers has been unable to buy an iPhone from AT&T’s online store. According to the report, an AT&T customer representative told him that “the phone is not offered to you because New York is not ready for the iPhone […] You don’t have enough towers to handle the phone.”The Consumerist obtained a written statement from AT&T spokesman Fletcher Cook, in which Cook said “We periodically modify our promotions and distribution channels.”This story is being taken by many to be an attempt by the carrier to follow up on AT&T mobile boss Ralph de la Vega’s statement that “the company is […] working on getting the data hogs to cut down their usage,” while at the same time “pushing its wireless margins into the 40 percent range next year from around 38 percent in the third quarter.”Other reports are speculating about the possibilities of credit-card crime, and that the hold on online sales in NYC is a security measure to curb fraud through online purchases. This would make some sense, as the iPhone can still be bought in physical stores. In fact, simply refusing online orders from zip-codes where fraud is rife seems like a remarkably effective and elegant cure.What is certain is that AT&T’s lack of a quick response is causing it PR damage. A simple, clear statement of intent would have been enough to diffuse this story. Well, that and some new cell-towers in New York.Updated 1:30 p.m. PDT: AT&T.com has resumed selling iPhones to New York customers.

Mozilla is now actively backing a movement that, if successful, would essentially nullify copyright infringement charges against individuals that ‘jailbreak’ their Apple iPhones – a practice that Apple considers illegal.Mozilla, the makers of the widely popular open source browser project Firefox, said in comments submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office that it supports the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in its request for an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The EFF wants the Copyright Office to let users ‘jailbreak’ their iPhones without fear of copyright infringement issues.Apple naturally opposes this request claiming that the act of ‘jailbreaking’ an Apple iPhone is in direction violation of copyright laws which protect its software. “Jailbreak” is a term given to the processes involved to circumvent the digital rights management (DRM) technology on the Apple iPhone so that users may install third-party applications not authorized by Apple or the mobile carrier. The term ‘jailbreak’ was pioneered by iPhone owners but has since made its way into the entire cellular world for all types of handsets.Although Mozilla made no direct mention of the iPhone by name in its comments, it is quite obvious who they were targeting, discreetly. Nearly all other handset manufacturers and mobile carriers do not carry the same restrictive measures that Apple imposes on iPhone owners.Quoting Mozilla CEO John Lilly from a previous interview with another source on Monday :“This is not us criticizing Apple,  but it’s the principle of the thing. Choice is good for users, and choice shouldn’t be criminalized. The Internet is too important for all of us for that”"By controlling the software that can be installed on these cellular phones, these companies can limit and control the type of programs and functionality that is available to users of their devices."Anderson feels as though the usage of DRM as a way to prevent people from installing software to their devices has a ‘chilling effect on users and innovation’, users become afraid to make use of their devices to their potential because it is deemed illegal. Anderson also continued on to argue that smartphones are akin to a desktop computer because they can be used to access the Internet, and users should have free choice to use any software program they choose to access.

We reported yesterday about Apple’s alleged delay in payments to iPhone app developers, but there is more alarming news from iPhone developers about Apple’s refund policies. Apparently, if iPhone users decide that they want a refund for an app (users can get a refund within 90 days, according to Apple policy), Apple requires that developers give back the money they received from the sale. But here’s the kicker—Apple will refund the full amount to the user and says that it has the right to keep its commission. So the developer not only has to return the money for the sale, but also has to reimburse Apple for its commission. Apple charges a 30% commission on all paid apps sold through the App Store. So basically, developers get 70% of a given sale but if the end-user wants a refund, the developer has to pay Apple 100% of the sale.Here’s the clause in the contract:In the event that Apple receives any notice or claim from any end-user that: (i) the end-user wishes to cancel its license to any of the Licensed Applications within ninety (90) days of the date of download of that Licensed Application by that end-user; or (ii) a Licensed Application fails to conform to Your specifications or Your product warranty or the requirements of any applicable law, Apple may refund to the end-user the full amount of the price paid by the end-user for that Licensed Application. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an end-user, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that Licensed Application. Apple will have the right to retain its commission on the sale of that Licensed Application, notwithstanding the refund of the price to the end.The developer we spoke to seemed to think that the app would become unusable if a consumer gets a refund for a particular application, but the developer was unclear if this actually happens. We were also told that this section of the contract is new, and developers are being forced to sign this in order to sell apps in the next generation App Store (for when the iPhone OS 3.0 is officially released). But we saw a contract from another iPhone developer who signed the agreement back in December and the same clause was part of the contract.We are assuming that Apple still has to pay bank fees on a charge if a consumer wants a refund, but certainly bank charges don’t amount to 30 percent. This policy still seems incredibly unfair to developers. Apple should instead require developers to return the exact amount they received from a refunded sale, not extra. Apple has a ton of money in the bank and could stand to make a lot more from the app store down the line as the iPhone user base grows. With these fees, Apple is pointing a big red arrow at why developers shouldn’t be developing for the iPhone—namely, they’re at the mercy of Apple, which is making a habit of treating its developers like dirt.

Google's Android OS has gained an astonishing 7 points of market share in the US smartphone market in the past three months, Comscore saysRIM's market share over the same period collapsed, dropping almost 5 points.Apple's iPhone share increased slightly, but is dead in the water and has now fallen way behind Android (in smartphones).(If you include iPod touches in the calculation,Apple's share has actually fallen).Android now has a third of the US market (33%). RIM's share has plummeted to 29%. Apple is holding at 25%.In the "also ran" category, Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 did nothing to stop its decline, which fell from 9% to 7.7%. And Palm, which is barely worth mentioning anymore, fell another point to 2.8%.Why do the Android gains matter? Are Apple bulls right that Apple has an insurmountable hold on the "premium" segment of the market and that it doesn't matter who has the other 75%?The Android gains matter because technology platform markets tend to standardize around a single dominant platform (see Windows in PCs, Facebook in social, Google in search). And the more dominant the platform becomes, the more valuable it becomes and the harder it becomes to dislodge. The network effect kicks in, and developers building products designed to work with the platform devote more and more of their energy to the platform. The reward for building and working with other platforms, meanwhile, drops, and gradually developers stop developing for them.Importantly, it's not a question of which platform is "better." (This is irrelevant.) It's a question of which platform everyone else uses.  And increasingly, in the smartphone market, barring a radical change in trend, that's Android.So that's why Android's gains matter. And, yes, Apple fans should be scared to death about them.Apple is fighting a very similar war to the one it fought--and lost--in the 1990s. It is trying to build the best integrated products, hardware and software, and maintain complete control over the ecosystem around them. This end-to-end control makes it easier for Apple to build products that are "better," but it makes it much harder for the company to compete against a software platform that is standard across many hardware manufacturers (Windows in the 1990s, Android now).As we explain here, two important things are different about the current Android - iPhone battle than the Mac - Windows war in the 1990s. First, Apple is maintaining price parity (or better) with the leading Android phones. (Macs always cost more than PCs). Second, Android is still a fragmented platform, which significantly reduces the benefits of "interoperability" across multiple manufacturers.Google is working to fix the second problem, though--enacting much tighter rules about how Android can be used. And if the platform is to become dominant and ubiquitous, it will likely continue to tighten these rules.And Apple's price parity certainly does not appear to have stopped the Android juggernaut.The unit and platform numbers below, which show the change in market share from November to February, are not unit sales in the month. They are total usage stats, showing how the platform usage shifted over the period.So these Android gains should scare the bejeezus out of Apple bulls -- and Apple itself. And Apple's decision to not release the iPhone 5 in June will likely exacerbate rather than slow this trend.Here's the US handset share, by manufacturer:And US smartphone platform share (this is the key one):And, relatedly, a look at what folks are doing with their handsets these days:

Last summer, when Apple pulled third-party Google Voice applications from the App Store, one of them was VoiceCentral. Apple’s subsequent rejection of the official Google Voice app spurred an FCC investigation, but Google Voice never made it to the app store and none of the other apps ever made it back in.Well, that’s not stopping the developers Riverturn, the company behind VoiceCentral. They are bringing back their app to the iPhone via the browser. They call it the Black Swan edition. You can get on a waiting list to be on the private beta here. The app is completely browser-based but has the look and feel of a regular app, complete with a dialer, list of transcribed voicemails, and SMS messages.When you dial a number, Google Voice simply makes a call to your iPhone while simultaneously calling the number of the person you are trying to reach, so you still pay for the voice minutes. But the appeal of having Google Voice on your iPhone is the ability to read transcribed voicemails, or play them, and avoid SMS charges by texting through Google Voice. (You cannot yet do all of these things when you access Google Voice via the iPhone’s browser directly).The downside is that it cannot access your contact list on your iPhone through the browser. Although, VoiceCentral mimics the look and feel of the iPhone contact manager, you have to export your contacts to Google Voice first and access them that way. Another limitation is that the audio plays through the speaker instead of through the earpiece, but if you are using a pair of earphones that is not a problem.VoiceCentral will probably be a paid app, but Apple won’t get any of the revenues since it is simply a mobile Website. It even offers offline caching and takes advantage of the HTML5 features of mobile Safari. This could very well be the future of mobile apps. As mobile browsers become more capable, more and more developers are going to ask themselves why bother with the limitations of the App Store and be at the mercy of Apple’s whims? And it won’t just be developers like VoiceCentral who have no other choice.Below is a promotional video which shows some of the features of VoiceCentral’s Black Swan app. Remember, this is all happening in the browser:

Although in numbers it lags behind Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, the Opera web browser is known for having a devoted fanbase. Opera has made inroads into gaming consoles and mobile platforms including the Wii, Nintendo DS, and approximately 40 million cell phones. So, you'd imagine that Opera would be a perfect match to the iPhone.Unfortunately, Apple thinks otherwise. A New York Times story from this week says that an iPhone version of Opera failed to make it past Apple's gatekeeper, "[Founder Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner] said that Opera's engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone, but Apple won't let the company release it because it competes with Apple’s own Safari browser," the Times wrote.Opera is known for being fast and secure, as well as accessible to a wide range of users. The mobile version of Opera can dynamically reformat web pages to better fit handheld displays using the company's small screen rendering technology. And, even though Opera representatives state that this rejection was due to duplicated functionality, Opera would have had a tough time getting through a different gate: Apple will not allow programs to interpret code. Opera, being a full-featured browser, interprets JavaScript downloaded from the Internet, an absolute App Store no-no.This isn't the first time that Apple has rejected software for duplicating core functionality. In September, Apple said no to MailWrangler, a program that simplified accessing multiple Gmail accounts. Around the same time, the company also declined to host Al Sokirynsky's Podcaster app, which allowed users to download podcasts and play them on the iPhone. Because of this, we don't find Opera's rejection particularly surprising, although it is a bit disappointing. Mobile Safari is a great mobile platform, but it would have been nice to have an iPhone version of Opera to play around with. Update: Gruber says the app probably wasn't even submitted.

The glass screens of the iPhone 4 reportedly shatter at a rate 82% higher than earlier versions of the phone. This led consumers to bring a lawsuit claiming that Apple ads boasting about the glass were deceptive. The consumers are for now out of luck.A federal judge in San Jose threw out a class action lawsuit from iPhone 4 owners who claimed that Apple misrepresented the strength of the phone’s glass.The lawsuit was brought by California man Betsalel Williamson who had to replace the screen of his brand new iPhone after he knocked it off the arm of a chair, resulting “in spider cracks across the back glass panel.”In his ruling handed down this week, US District Judge Edward Davila wrote that “it is a well known fact of life that glass can break under impact” and said the iPhone owners failed to show that Apple breached a warranty or violated California’s consumer protection laws.The lawsuit argued that Apple ads touting the glass as “20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic . . . ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever” were misleading. It cited a study that the glass on the iPhone 4 breaks at a 82% higher rate than earlier iPhones, forcing consumers to to pay $29 to replace a cracked screen and $199 if the glass housing breaks.Judge Davila didn’t buy the claims, however, and wrote that Steve Jobs’ claims about the glass were “mere puffery” rather than a promise that could be the basis of a lawsuit:The judge noted in several other parts of the ruling that a phone without a case was more vulnerable.Davila gave permission for the plaintiffs to amend the complaint in order to show how specifically Apple deceived them.The judge’s ruling, which was first reported by Law360 (sub. req’d), is below with relevant portions underlined:

The first rule of the iPhone developer program is: You do not talk about the iPhone developer program.Before you create software for the iPhone, Apple demands that you sign away a laundry list of rights, including the ability to sell rejected apps through other channels, the ability to sue Apple for more than $50, and the ability to reverse-engineer or modify the iPhone or its SDK — and even the right to talk about your agreement with Apple.The iPhone Developer Program License Agreement (.pdf) spells out all these requirements and more. Previously secret, the agreement has been acquired and published with the help of the Freedom of Information Act.The Electronic Frontier Foundation reported Monday evening that it gained access to a March 2009 version of the agreement. EFF noticed that NASA had developed an iPhone app, so the cyber-rights foundation then used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the agreement from NASA. The space agency judged that the FOIA trumps the Apple agreement, so they turned the Apple document over to EFF.The contents of the agreement are hardly surprising, The EFF’s Fred von Lohmann summed up the highlights:“If Apple’s mobile devices are the future of computing, you can expect that future to be one with more limits on innovation and competition … than the PC era that came before,” von Lohmann wrote. “It’s frustrating to see Apple, the original pioneer in generative computing, putting shackles on the market it (for now) leads.”Though the agreement may appear one-sided, Apple’s nondisclosure agreement for developers was more strict when the App Store first opened. Apple imposed a nondisclosure agreement in 2008 forbidding developers to discuss developing for iPhone OS 2.0. Developers were turned off by the NDA, because it stifled them from discussing programming tips with one another. Apple later dropped this part of the nondisclosure agreement, saying its purpose was to protect its intellectual property.

Just when we thought it was almost over, we realize the party has only just started. New reports today are clearly stating that while Samsung might have lost the battle, in the end they’ll win the war. According to the Korean Times Samsung holds just over 10% of all 4G LTE (long term evolution) patents and is prepared to play some offense of their own in the courtroom.What we are now hearing is that Samsung is basically saying “We dare you” to release a 4G LTE iPhone — which is rumored to be a part of the next iPhone launch — and once they do Samsung will sue the pants off of them and go into full revenge/attack mode. The iPad currently has LTE, yes, but Samsung has been waiting for a much bigger fish and that is Apple’s bread and butter – the iPhone.Sadly just this afternoon a story came out regarding Apple and Google themselves having private discussions to end these drawn out and angry patent lawsuits — but it appears that Samsung wants nothing to do with that. Obviously these reports can’t be confirmed at this time but we are hearing some reliable information is at hand regarding this.This is actually a very interesting development in this entire story. If Apple does launch an LTE iPhone (which is pretty likely) they’ll quickly be rounding up the troops once more and headed to court. Samsung will no doubt seek an immediate product injunction and ban from the US, and probably multiple other countries as their patents are very wide. Now obviously Apple needs to release an iPhone 5 with 4G LTE as that is something consumers are basically demanding these days. If they do they will get sued, and if they don’t then people will jump for the Android LTE options available.The new iPhone should be announced sometime in mid September so we’ll all know soon enough. Will this ever end?

Earlier this week, I noted a new suite of police-policing apps including OpenWatch and Cop Recorder, which turn your phone into a “reverse surveillance camera” for secretly recording run-ins with authority figures. Now it appears that police are well aware of those programs and others that complicate law enforcement, and at least some cops are none too happy about them.That’s one of the revelations of the latest operation by the hacker group LulzSec, which yesterday dumped a cache of files that it stole from the Arizona Police Department, calling Arizona a “racial profiling anti-immigrant police state.” A pair of documents among the hundreds leaked show concerns about how smartphones are being used for everything from recording interactions with police to evading speed traps.One document labelled “Law Enforcement Sensitive” lists the following apps, and warns officers to “take the time to look at an arrestee’s cell phone to see what applications they have.”Cop Recorder: Developed under the OpenWatch project, the app lets users stealthily record their interactions with police or other authority figures and upload them to OpenWatch’s server, where some of the videos are anonymized and posted online with legal analysis. The latest version of the app for Android, called OpenWatch rather than Cop Recorder, allows the secret capturing of video as well as audio.Trapster and Police Alert: Both apps aim to show users the location of speed traps. The free app Trapster crowdsources the problem, allowing users to add or confirm police locations, even tracking users’ reputations to improve the accuracy of their submissions. Police Alert, a $3.99 app for Android, seems to map out police locations without user interaction, but users warn in reviews that it rarely updates and is largely inaccurate.Caller ID Faker: Users can spoof a call’s source through the Web or using an app for Android or for jailbroken iPhones, entering whatever ID number they choose and even altering their voice. Presumably police fear that the app, which offers what its website calls “good laughs to make it through the crazy stress of each day,” has led to an increase in prank 911 calls.Another document from LulzSec’s hacked collection, provided to Arizona’s police from the Department of Justice’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property division, describes concerns over Apple’s “find my iPhone” feature, which allows users to remotely wipe their phone’s data. The Department warns that users may delete evidence from seized phones.Law enforcement’s solution? Keep seized phones in metal-plated Faraday bags or other radio-frequency-shielded container until their data can be copied.Here’s the full PDF of that “Find my iPhone” brief.Leaking its smartphone-related documents is the least of the Arizona police’s worries after the LulzSec hack. In a response to the breach, officials have warned that it could lead to retaliation against individual officers in the state. “Law enforcement officials go to many lengths to protect their identities,” Arizona Highway Patrol Association president Jimmy Chavez wrote in a statement Thursday.  “These individuals maliciously released confidential information knowing the safety of DPS employees, and their families, would be compromised.  A threat to release more DPS files demonstrates how heinous the hackers are willing to act. The AHPA would like to see the people brought to justice and prosecuted to the highest degree of the law.”

As much as I have enjoyed Gizmodo's scoops about new technology, I am afraid this is the last time I will be visiting the site. I was excited to read about Apple's new iPhone but horrified to see personal details of the engineer that lost it published on the site. I am sure he was horrified to have lost the phone but I cannot imagine what it must feel like to have his photo plastered all over stories about his legendary fuck up.Thank you for your feedback. Here's the reason why we decided to post the story.Powell is now under the public eye, which will protect him against Apple firing him (We believe he's still employed and Apple didn't fire him when they found out, a month ago. He's a valuable engineer). It's embarrassing, yes, but it's like insurance. If Apple fires him, they will get a huge PR backslash.But let's not forget: 1) He lost one of the most valuable gadgets in the world. And 2) the story—and his name—was going to be reported by other media. We had the facts before anyone else. It was our job to report on it.You should look at the bigger picture.. j.

Steven Levy, a journalist from Newsweek magazine, holds the Apple iPhone outside the Apple store on New York's 5th Avenue June 29, 2007.Professor Jonathan Zittrain says the latest must-have devices are sealed, "sterile" boxes that stifle creativity and turn consumers into passive users of technology.Unlike home computers, new Internet-enabled gadgets don't lend themselves to the sort of tinkering and collaboration that leads to technological advances, he says.The mix of gadgets, over-regulation and Internet security fears could destroy the old system where mainstream technology could be "influenced, even revolutionized, out of left field"."I don't want to see a two-tier world where only the experts can survive ... and the non-experts are stuck between something they don't understand and something that limits them," Zittrain told Reuters in an interview.Zittrain, professor of Internet governance and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford University, says the Internet's simple, open architecture is key to its enormous success and also its flaws.Amateur enthusiasts have come up with scores of new ideas by tinkering with the Internet on home computers. However, hackers have caused huge disruption by exploiting its loose structure.Zittrain contrasts one of the first mass-produced home computers, the Apple II from the 1970s, with Apple's latest gadget, the iPhone. He says the iPhone is typical of what he calls "tethered appliances"."They are appliances in that they are easy to use, while not easy to tinker with," he writes. "They are tethered because it is easy to for their vendors to change them from afar, long after the devices have left warehouses and showrooms."They are a world away from the "generative Internet", a term Zittrain uses to describe the open, creative, innovative approach that helped build the Internet.The rise of viruses and fraud has also led to tighter controls on PCs, particularly those in schools, universities, offices and public places, Zittrain says.People are often blocked from experimenting with shared computers and their input is severely limited.There is still time to save the Internet, he believes, although the answer lies in social rather than technological changes.Society should resist more regulation and place its trust in the Internet's users. The success of Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia written and edited by its readers, shows how self-governance can work.Internet users should see themselves as "netizens", active participants in the online world rather than passive consumers."The community itself exercises a form of self-restraint and policing," he said. "You see it in Britain when you try to jump a queue, you see it on Wikipedia when a page is vandalised."The challenge to the technologists is to build technologies to let people of good faith help without having to devote their lives to it."* The Future of the Internet and How To Stop It, futureoftheinternet.org , is published by Penguin.

Chinese workers injured while making touchscreens for mobile devices, including iPhones, have written to Apple asking it to do more to help them.Some 137 workers suffered adverse health effects following exposure to a chemical, known as n-hexane.They claim that the Taiwanese factory owner has not given them enough compensation.Apple did not offer comment on the letter.Five workers, including 27-year-old Jia Jingchuan, have signed a letter to chief executive officer Steve Jobs, asking Apple to offer more help over the incidents.They say that the factory owner has not given enough compensation, has pressured those who took compensation to give up their jobs and failed to offer assurance that workers who may suffer fresh illnesses will have medical bills taken care of.Wintek, the Taiwanese company that owns the factory, said that it used the chemical in place of alcohol because it evaporated more quickly and speeded up production of touchscreens.It has now reverted to using alcohol to clean screens.Workers exposed to n-hexane experienced faintness and tiredness, sweaty hands and feet, numbness in hands and swelling and pain in feet. Some claim they are still suffering ill-effects.Experts say that daily exposure to n-hexane can cause long-term damage.In its annual report, published last week, Apple acknowledged the incident."In 2010 we learned that 137 workers at the Suzhou facility of Wintek, one of Apple's suppliers, had suffered adverse health effects following exposure to n-hexane, a chemical in cleaning agents used in some manufacturing processes," the report read."We required Wintek to stop using n-hexane and to provide evidence that they had removed the chemical from their production lines," it said.Apple said it also asked the firm to provide adequate ventilation in the factory. It will monitor the plant and will reaudit the facility later this year.Wintek also supplies components to a number of other companies, including Nokia and HTC.This is not the first problem Apple has experienced with its Chinese factories.Its annual report also references an incident at its main China supplier Foxconn's factory, where over a dozen workers committed suicide."We were disturbed and deeply saddened to learn that factory workers were taking their own lives," the report read.It said "suicide prevention specialists" were working with Foxconn to improve conditions.

Google Sync's pretty awesome as it is, but it's had one glaring flaw in its implementation: no support for Gmail, just Calendar and Contacts, which means you aren't able to get true push email delivered. Well, they've gone ahead and completed the holy Google trinity today with the introduction of Gmail support into the Exchange ActiveSync mix, so any phone with Exchange support should theoretically be able to get in on the action. We say "theoretically" because they're only quoting support for the iPhone and Windows Mobile at this point, but it seems like anything that can speak the EAS protocol should be able to make this happen. Let us know your trials, tribulations, and successes getting this set up in comments, won't you?

Surveillance companies can use your iPhone to take photos of you and your surroundings without your knowledge, said a representative from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism at a panel chaired by Julian Assange™ today.Companies also sell products that will let them change the messages you write, track your location and nick your email contacts, claimed speakers on the panel that included representatives from Privacy International and the aforementioned bureau."Who here has an iPhone, who has a BlackBerry, who uses Gmail?" Assange asked. "Well you're all screwed," he continued, "the reality is that intelligence operations are selling right now mass surveillance systems for all those products".Speaking on the panel, Pratap Chatterjee of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (which works out of City University, but is an independent organisation) said that your phone could be used to record and send information about you even when it is in stand-by mode. That data included location, recordings of your conversations and even photographs. This spy software could run on iPhone, BlackBerry and Windows mobile kit.Stefania Maurizi, a journalist from Italy's weekly news magazine L'Espresso, showed documents that suggested that software products could not only read emails and text messages sent from spied-on phones, but could actually fake new ones or alter the text of messages sent.As The Reg has already discussed, all these software products are commercially available, and sold seemingly without any regulation.Maurizi and N Ram, editor-in-chief of India's The Hindu newspaper (speaking over a Skype connection) said that they were particularly worried by the lack of a legal framework and the absence of checks and balances in the surveillance system.Steven Murdoch of Cambridge Security group said such software was being made by British companies including ones based in Surrey and Oxford.He added that even lawful interception was no longer targeted and backed up by suspicions. "We're seeing increasingly wholesale monitoring of entire populations with no suspicion of wrongdoing – the data is being monitored and stored in the hope that it might one day be useful.""Without controls on this industry, the threat that surveillance poses to freedom on expression and human rights in general is only going to increase." ®

Intel outlined its plan to catch up in the smartphone processor business at its annual investor day in Santa Clara, California, Thursday: crush competitors with the weight of its multi-billion-dollar fabs and the thousands of developers it can throw at the problem of tuning mobile software to run on its processors.The goal: keep the attention of key customers such as Apple as smartphones, tablets, and personal computing devices converge. Apple relies on Intel processors for its notebook and desktop computers, and ARM-based designs for its booming smartphone and tablet products — leading some to fret that Apple could one day switch to ARM-based chips for the Mac.“Our job is to ensure our silicon is so compelling, in terms off running the Mac better or being a better iPad device, that as they make those decisions they can’t ignore us,” Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said.Earlier this year Motorola Mobility and Lenovo — among others — announced plans to build phones using Intel’s mobile processors. More are coming, Otellini promised. “A year ago there was no one who was not an Intel employee who thought Intel stood a chance in this business,” Otellini said. “And now you’re asking what our market share goals are.”While Intel may be an underdog in smartphone processors, Herman Eul, who co-managers Intel’s mobile and communications group with Mike Bell, argued that Intel is already an “incumbent” in the broader wireless semiconductor business, particularly in radio-frequency chips. Since Intel closed its acquisition of German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon’s wireless assets, Intel has shipped 500 million wireless chipsets.Intel’s formula for addressing its challenge in the smartphone processor business is the same one the Santa Clara, Calif.-based processor manufacturer has used to dominate everything from server rooms to personal computers: use its size to support manufacturing capabilities its rivals can’t match.Intel is racing to pair its smartphone processor designs — which are based on the same x86 processor architecture that now dominates the notebook business — with its latest manufacturing processes. “What the process technology does is gives us better performance, at better power at better size,” Intel’s Bell said. “We think this is a fundamental advantage that we have.”While rivals are struggling to crank enough processors with features 28 nanometers wide to meet demand this year, Bell said Intel plans to leapfrog them with an upcoming part, the Intel XMM 7260, with features just 22 nanometers wide next year. Intel will follow up with processors built using Intel’s 14 nanometer manufacturing process in 2014.Rivals, meanwhile, are counting on cheap chips built by contract manufacturers to knock Intel off its game. “You don’t want to be dragging around an asset base based on a model that might be changing,” AMD Chief Executive Rory Read told Forbes in February. Nvidia CEO Jen Hsun-Huang has even cheekily suggested that Intel build Nvidia’s chips in its factories.Intel’s secret weapon: a massive corps of software engineers. Intel is the second largest contributor to the open-source Linux operating system. It’s using that expertise to help tune mobile software for its chips: it has 1200 engineers helping Google with its Android mobile operating system. It also helped Apple manage its shift from PowerPC processors to Intel’s processors for the Mac. There can be doubt Intel would be happy to help Apple make a similar shift in its smartphone and tablet businesses.

A group of thieves in Japan got a jump start on nabbing Apple Inc .’s iPhone 5 before anyone else in the world Friday morning.At a time when thousands of eager Apple fans were already lined up outside outlets around the world, Osaka police said 191 of Apple’s latest must-have smartphone were stolen in the wee hours leading up to the official launch. As of Friday at noon, three stores were hit across Japan’s western metropolis in an unusual string of robberies targeting the hottest tech toy this fall.Authorities said they discovered 33 iPhone 5’s were missing from one of KDDI Corp .’s au-brand shops in Ibaraki city, a suburban nook in Osaka prefecture. The iPhone is available on KDDI’s au network, one of the two Japanese carriers that provides services to the U.S. giant’s sleek gadgets. The police went to check out the outlet after some nearby residents called a little before 3 a.m. saying they saw three men snooping around the store. The men and the phones remain at large. A police spokesman said there was no one lined up outside the store at the time of the robbery.About two hours later, a Softbank Corp store in the western district of Osaka city was wiped clean of its iPhone 5 stock. All 116 devices were stolen, including one store display. The police said they were taken from the locked backroom within a four minute span from 4:24 a.m. as shown on security camera footage. The video recording also showed there were three culprits, all likely to be male. The police said it is uncertain whether the robbery is related to the incident in Ibaraki, located about 20 minutes away by car. The store manager called the police at around 7:45 a.m. when he arrived at the store and discovered the lock to the store pried open. The police valued the stolen goods at ¥7.45 million. The store didn’t open on Friday.A nearby au store was broken into at 2:30 a.m. where 42 iPhone 5’s were taken. Only two, which were packed elsewhere in the store, were left behind. The police said it is unclear whether any of the people behind the other two robberies were involved in this one. The authorities have yet to see the security footage so do not have an idea of who or how many suspects there may be.The thefts are an unfamiliar sidebar accompanying the frenzied first hours when Apple’s latest product hit store shelves, which have previously run into technical glitches. But it’ll likely add to the supply stress. Apple said initial sales of the iPhone 5 set a new company record. Pre-orders on the first day topped 2 million units. Since then, Apple has said pre-order customers would have to wait up to one month for a new iPhone to ship.Like Japan Real Time on Facebook for the latest updates.

I know it's not a mind blowing concept, and frankly it's the way I see the cellular industry proceeding, or would expect to proceed, within the next, maybe, five years or so. I'm just curious if anyone in the know - whether it be someone that works on the communication hardware, or works for any of the major telecom companies, or is an engineer on any of the communication infrastructure, etc. - could tell me what's holding things up.I have the impression, with the advent of smart phones like the iPhone and various Android handsets, that the cellular industry will be shifting to a service whereby all information to and from a user's phone will simply be data - very similar to a computer and an internet connection, frankly. As phones become more PC/Mac-esque, it simply seems like an inevitability. You have a portable device, and information is accessed through a telecom's cellular network.So what's preventing this sort of shift? I'm aware that the telecoms are able to set different pricing depending on the type of usage in a manner that doesn't accurately reflect the strain on their infrastructure - particularly for text messages, if I understand things correctly. So is it purely about money? Or, is there actually something technically different between a smartphone making a call, sending a text, or receiving data that does genuinely affect the manner in which these different forms of communication are handled on the network's side of things?It just blows my mind how different the cellular phone industry is from other seemingly similar services, such as internet, television, and home phone. I don't understand how or why customers continue to put up with extensive two or three year contracts for a service that should, I would think, be a simple month to month access to data. Effectively, very similar to cellular/satellite access to the internet though your phone, and no more.(I'd also like to see a shift away from subsidized phone prices, much like Apple is trying to do. Buy an unlocked phone every few years as necessary, and find a provider that can hook you up month to month. But that's an entirely different topic all together.)

If you feel like going through the process of typing in your PIN every time you unlock your iPhone is worth it thanks to the unconquerable security it implies, you might want to read this report from Bernd Marienfeldt about the chosen one's security model. Yes, a PIN will keep casual users from picking up your phone and making a call with it, or firing off an e-mail to your co-workers saying that you're quitting and becoming an exotic dancer, but it won't keep someone from accessing all your data. Bernd and fellow security guru Jim Herbeck have discovered that plugging even a fully up-to-date, non-jailbroken iPhone 3GS into a computer running Ubuntu Lucid Lynx allows nearly full read access to the phone's storage -- even when it's locked. The belief is that they're just a buffer overflow away from full write access as well, which would surely open the door to making calls. Bernd believes the iPhone's lack of data encryption for content is a real problem, and also cites the inability to digitally sign e-mails as reasons why the iPhone is still not ready for prime time in the enterprise.

Remember that smart German iPhone-controlled car that used cameras, GPS, and lasers to perfectly run through the streets of Berlin? Well, screw German efficient engineering. That's not how we do things in America.Here we modify battered, crappy cars—like this 1988 Oldsmobile Delta—in just four weeks using "a few motors, potentiometers, a Compact RIO embedded controller, and LabVIEW," which get connected to the iPhone using Wi-Fi. And then we strip out the doors for fun. And we ride it on top of its roof. Hopefully to an In-n-Out drive-in. Would you like to do it yourself? Your lucky day, Mad Max. Here's a video tutorial:And if that wasn't enough, you can also drive it using a modded Power Wheels truck. America, I salute you. [Engineer Awesome via LikeCool]

Spyware developed by a U.K. group can take control of a number of mobile devices, including iPhones and BlackBerrys, turning on microphones and cameras, tracking locations and monitoring emails, text messages and voice calls.Gamma International specializes in “governmental IT intrusion and remote monitoring solutions,” as its website says. The company’s FinFisher software can infect personal computers as well, intercepting Skype calls and recording keystrokes, and was recently used to suppress dissent in Bahrain. The company says it did not sell the product to Bahrain’s government.“People are walking around with tools for surveillance in their pockets,” said John Scott-Railton, a doctoral student at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs who researched the software. “These are the tools that can be used to turn on your microphone and turn your phone into a tracking device.”The findings—which are consistent with Gamma’s own promotional materials for a FinFisher product called FinSpy Mobile—illustrate how the largely unregulated trade in offensive hacking tools is transforming surveillance, making it more intrusive as it reaches across borders and peers into peoples’ digital devices. FinFisher products can secretly monitor computers, intercepting Skype calls, turning on Web cameras and recording keystrokes. They are marketed by Gamma for law enforcement and government use. “I can confirm that Gamma supplies a piece of mobile intrusion software—FinSpy Mobile,” Gamma International GmbH Managing Director Martin J. Muench said in an Aug. 28 e-mail. “I certainly don’t intend to discuss how or on what platforms it works. I do not wish to inform criminals of how any of our detection systems are used against them.”More Below the AdIf you have trouble leaving a comment, review this help page. Still having problems?

Apple still hasn’t said a word about the new A6 SoC within the iPhone 5, but no matter: Chipworks — a company that specializes in reverse engineering computer chips — has now completed its initial analysis of the A6, and the results are very interesting indeed. The A6 features a custom, in-house, laid-out-by-hand dual-core design (pictured above) that is neither a Cortex-A9 or A15, and a tri-core GPU.By far the most exciting aspect of this news is the fact that the A6?s dual ARM CPU cores have been manually laid out — an approach that used to be the norm, but which is now almost unheard of outside of Intel (even AMD has given up). Today, chips are nearly always laid out using advanced, CAD-like software — the designer says he wants X cache, Y FPUs, and Z cores, and the software automagically creates a chip. Hand-drawn processors, on the other hand, are painstakingly laid out by chip designers. This approach obviously takes a lot longer (and is a lot more expensive), but if it’s done correctly the end result can be a lot faster.In the case of the A6, which benchmarks very well indeed, it would seem that its chip design department knows what it’s doing. This probably isn’t a big surprise, though, when you remember that Apple acquired PA Semi back in 2008, for the purpose of bolstering the capabilities of its mobile devices. PA Semi was founded by one of DEC’s lead chip designers and has over a hundred engineers who have worked on chips at Intel and AMD, among others. I wouldn’t be surprised if PA Semi has been working on the hand-made A6 since its acquisition.As far as the custom core’s actual functionality, we still don’t have much to go on. At this point, it still looks like the A6?s CPU core is similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 Krait — roughly doubling the performance of the Cortex-A9 chip, while still remaining very power efficient.Now, the tri-core GPU. Chipworks says that the GPU cores Imagination Technologies PowerVR cores — but beyond that, we don’t know exactly what they are. Judging by Apple’s boast of “2x the performance,” we are probably looking at the same SGX543 GPU cores found in the A5 and A5X SoCs, but at a higher clock speed.Beyond the hardware specs, Chipworks’ reverse engineering also confirms that the A6 is produced using Samsung’s 32nm HKMG process, and that the total die size is 9.7mm by 9.97mm (96mm). This is actually quite large, when you bear in mind that the 32nm A5 only had an area of 71mm. The 26-square-millimeter difference is mostly accounted for by the larger, hand-made CPU cores in the A6, and the addition of a third GPU core.Unfortunately, beyond the CPU and GPU cores, Chipworks hasn’t labeled any other SoC features. We know that most of the right and bottom edges are the interface, and the silver squares on the mid-right are PLLs — but beyond that, the other squares are unknown. If you recognize any of the features, leave a comment below.For lots and lots of pretty photos, be sure to hit up Chipworks. Not only have their engineers reverse engineered the A6, they’ve also taken a look at the Sony camera sensor — and over on iFixit, Chipworks has shared some die shots of the Qualcomm MDM9615 radio and the Broadcom WiFi chip.Now read: Scuffgate: Will Apple have to recall the iPhone 5?

Nokia’s upcoming Lumia 900 Windows Phone could be the first smartphone running Microsoft’s mobile operating system to really make a splash in the United States. BGR exclusively reported that the new flagship 4G handset will hit AT&T store shelves late next month alongside a massive marketing blitz and a big subsidy program that will leave the phone with a surprisingly low $99.99 price tag. As impressive as the Lumia 900 is shaping up to be, however, Nokia is apparently working on another smartphone with new technology that will blow us all away. Read on for more.In an interview with Finnish newspaper Kauppalehti, Nokia design boss Marko Ahtisaari said that the company is currently working on a revolutionary new smartphone that will make other handsets seem dated.According to the Nokia executive, Apple’s user interface on the iPhone is “poorly designed” and convoluted. “The road from the kitchen into the dining room is always through the front door,” Ahtisaari told Kauppalehti. Meanwhile, operating systems like Symbian and Android are described by the design veteran as “dollhouses,” with furniture users can pick and rearrange.Microsoft’s Windows Phone is more natural according to Ahtisaari, and the mysterious new smartphone Nokia is building will apparently push the mobile platform even further into the future.The executive wouldn’t provide any firm details regarding the device, but he didn’t hesitate to set sky-high expectations. The phone will feature breakthrough technology that revolutionizes the user experience according to Ahtisaari, and owners will not have to bend down or even touch the screen in order to operate it.Ahtisaari’s brief description of the technology suggests some type heads-up technology, or perhaps voice-driven controls similar to Apple’s virtual assistant Siri or Microsoft Kinect. We’re not sure how revolutionary voice controls would be be considering how widely voice command technology will be used this year, however. Nokia declined to comment.UPDATE: A Nokia spokesperson contacted BGR with additional details regarding some of Ahtisaari’s comments. The interface elements he described during his interview are in fact concepts Ahtisaari has been discussing since December 2010, when he spoke about them on stage at LeWeb. The spokesperson declined to comment on if or when these concepts might appear in a production device.

In light of all the complaints from customers receiving new iPhone 5 handsets that scratch and scuff easily, it appears another problem is plaguing Apple’s (AAPL) latest product: light leakage. According to MacRumorsforum member “Leotno,” some white iPhone 5 models are showing slight light leakage between device’s glass display and chamfered aluminum antenna. BGR has confirmed on one of its own units (see photo below) that there is indeed a small crack on some new iPhone 5 units located just below the power button. It’s uncertain at this point if the issue is an isolated one that affects only some iPhone 5 models or if it’s actually a widespread defect. The light leak and loosening chamfer on BGR’s defective iPhone 5 was a 64GB white and silver model running on AT&T. The light leak is unnoticeable except when the iPhone 5 is used under low-light or completely dark situations.Various members on theMacRumors forums have reported the same problem, with some receiving brand new (not refurbished) models as replacements from Apple Stores. One member who goes by the handle “vineetnangia” said the replacement Apple provided still had the same issue.

It is being reported by Chinese news services that a number of workers at manufacturer Wintek are suffering from n-hexane poisoning.Wintek produces touchscreen displays for Apple’s iPhone and iPod touch devices. As part of that process the screens need to be cleaned, which usually involves alcohol as the cleaning agent. But the chemical n-hexane is also a well-known cleaning chemical used mainly in textile manufacturing, and it looks as though Wintek may have opted to use it.It may be a good cleaner, but it’s quite bad for us humans. In small doses inhalation can lead to euphoria, headaches, and nausea. Long term, however, it is linked to nervous system failure, with early symptoms including cramps and tingling sensations in the arms and legs. Exposure on a daily basis would certainly increase the risk of such symptoms and eventual illness.Reports of n-hexane use and poisoning at Wintek come from China Daily TV (Chinese-language video). It reported 49 Wintek employees received treatment in hospital from August last year for their symptoms. It also seems as if the response has only been to ask Wintek to stop using the chemical and change management.At the moment this seems to be just accusations rather than concrete proof the chemical is being used. However, a couple of months before the employees entered hospital protests were held by the Taiwan Labor Organization over poor working conditions at Wintek. Further protests were also held in January this year.This chemical is refined from crude oil and used in gasoline, glues, leather products, and roofing. So the risk of using it in a factory setting is not only the exposure for humans, but the high possibility of a fire breaking out and spreading very quickly if not handled correctly.Choosing to use n-hexane instead of alcohol may be down to cost or availability. Maybe someone at Wintek managed to get a shipment of n-hexane very cheap and was using it to boost profit margins on what must be large orders coming from Apple. Alternatively, it could have been viewed as the better solution with the risks being overlooked or seen as minimal.If the poisoning and poor working conditions turn out to be true we should expect Apple to take action. The company doesn’t want to be associated with such practices and Wintek may lose its contract. Otherwise guarantees need to be made that future production will follow more stringent rules and the employees effected receive ongoing care. No one wants to buy a gadget that potentially made a worker ill; and possibly for the rest of their lives.

Barcelona — Today I tried out Opera Mini running on the iPhone, and it kicks Safari’s butt. The folks at Opera have a native version of their browser running on the iPhone, and while there are limits due to the way it is built, for sheer speed of browsing, it has Safari beat.Opera Mini has not yet been submitted to Apple for approval: The demo I saw was of a very mature but unfinished version. But when it does get sent to Apple’s crack team of picky, fickle reviewers, it should, technically at least, pass. The reason that browsers other than those based on Webkit (Safari) aren’t allowed on the iPhone is that Apple bans the running of interpretive code. This means Java, or Flash, or any other runtime is out.Opera Mini gets around this by doing all the rendering on the server – Opera’s servers actually run web browsers – and sending what are essentially pictures to the phone. These “pictures” look and act like regular web pages, only they are 90% smaller. That’s a big deal if you’re using a phone in a country with expensive bandwidth (Russia is a big market for Opera Mini).IPhone users will be more interested in the cost reductions for roaming data use, and in speed. We loaded up the NYT front page in both browsers (Opera’s Phillip Grønvold is pretty good at hitting both “go” buttons at once) and we were up and browsing five or six pages deep with Opera before Safari had even finished the front page. Better, Opera is responsive to zooming and scrolling as soon as the text is up on screen. IPhone users know that this isn’t the case for Mobile Safari.Another speed-up comes from caching. Not caching pages, but keeping the markup file (like we said, they’re not really just pictures) from each page, ready to re-display. This gives instant back-and-forward navigation.There are some quirks. In order to keep things consistent across platforms (Opera Mini is available for almost any modern phone), some iPhone UI conventions are ignored. Copy and paste gets its own custom widgets, although it still talks to the built-in clipboard. In this way it is a little like, say, Photoshop, which has almost identical versions on Windows and OS X, even if the OS X version annoys many Mac users with its UI.If Opera makes it through the Apple approval process, I’ll be grabbing it right away. The speed makes it perfect the kind of fast reading you do on a phone. And it has one feature that will surely make Apple warm to it: because it doesn’t support video of any kind, Opera Mini won’t display Flash.

Skype is set to launch its iPhone application Tuesday, bringing its much-anticipated Net-based phone service to Apple's mobile platform. With the Skype iPhone app, users will be able to make free calls using Wi-Fi to other Skype users as well as use their Skype accounts to make reduced price calls to traditional landline phones. Skype announced its iPhone application will be available on Tuesday for free, with a version for the BlackBerry available in May. Mobile versions of Skype are already available for Nokia, Windows Mobile, and Google Android phones.From what we can tell, the Skype for iPhone looks great; but it has some drawbacks. One disappointment is that users won't be able to place calls over cellular networks, but only via Wi-Fi. Still, for international callers especially, Skype's iPhone app will save callers money by allowing them to avoid AT&T's traditional wireless phone network and adds the convenience of allowing Skype users to use their iPhone handset for Skype calls.Looking more like a traditional iPhone app rather than the desktop Windows counterpart most of its 400 million users are used to, Skype for iPhone features five tabs at the bottom of the screen, displaying contacts, chats, a calling panel, call history, and your profile (with Facebook-style status).Skype for iPhone will use phone numbers directly from your phone's address book, so no more nasty duplicated contact lists. It even displays your contacts' photos (if they have one set up on Skype). Conference calling is available, but for the moment you can only take part in one if someone invites you.You can also chat with your Skype friends, but unfortunately this is the only thing (besides seeing who's online) you can do over a cellular network. Skype for iPhone places calls only via Wi-Fi, not differentiating itself much from the other voice apps in the App Store (Skype for T-Mobile G1 can place calls over 3G).Skype for iPhone is still a young app and is short on some of the features its desktop counterparthas. SMS, video and proper conference calling, file transfer, and voicemail are missing from this first version, but let's hope they will make their way in future versions.iPod Touch users will also be able to enjoy Skype, but this would require them to purchase a microphone, or headphones with built-in microphones (like the iPhone's).

Microsoft and Nokia announced the flagship Windows Phone handset, the Nokia Lumia 920, at a press event in New York City on Wednesday. Just like the lack of grounding that plagued the end of the announcement (no pricing, dates, or availability information), the presenters on the show floor were extremely stingy when it came to letting us get our paws on the device. But we got a few touches in.The yellow and red Lumia 920 both have glossy plastic bodies, while the black uses a matte finish (not quite as rubberized as the Lumia 900). The screens are curved glass, and the top and bottom edges don't have the same taper as the Lumia 900 did.The Lumia 920 is a bit larger in both directions, to accommodate the slightly larger 4.5-inch screen. While none of the phones shown were final production models, the screen seemed to have poor viewing angles when rotated top to bottom; side-to-side, we saw very little dimming.We only saw two demos on the show floor, one of which demonstrated the NFC capabilities of various charging and audio accessories for the Lumia 920. All worked as promised: touch the phone to the surface and it either starts charging or pairs automatically with the set of headphones or speaker for music playback.A second demo for the camera exhibited the low-light capabilities of the camera, with photos taken with flash, without flash on the Lumia 920's PureView camera, and without flash on a competing smartphone camera. The PureView camera's low-light performance did make it much easier to see the subject of the photo as well as her surroundings.However, with that feature turned on, it was impossible to tell that the photo was taken at night, which was a bit disorienting to us. It also created phantom light sources, as if there were a floodlight shining a few feet in front of the subject. Likewise, the sky was an apocalyptic white, yet seemed to cast no light on the subject.(Update: the integrity of several of Nokia's demo photos for the Lumia 920 has been called into question. Youssef Sarhan has pointed out that certain photos purportedly taken with the Lumia 920 have some graphic impossibilities, and GSMArena has claimed the park photos above to be suspect, precisely because of the unusual lighting sources we noted. Nokia has already admitted to and apologized for using a simulated demo video for the Lumia 920's image stabilization, but has yet to address the images. We've reached out for comment on this matter.)In a real-life demo, a presenter invited us to take a picture in a dark, enclosed space with our own iPhone 4S, to compare to a shot he took with the Lumia 920. The difference in results was very impressive.Whatever positive notes the Lumia 920 may have, it still seems like little more than a pipe dream to us without pricing, concrete release dates, or availability info. Microsoft has promised to release this info in the fourth quarter of this year.The first PureView camera in the Nokia PureView 808 clocked in at a whopping 41 megapixels. But Nokia has been insisting that PureView is not about specific camera hardware or megapixel count; it's about using hardware and software to produce the best possible photographs. The camera in the Lumia 920 may disappoint those who were hoping for another 41 megapixels to oversample, but the Lumia 920 arguably makes up for this with impressive low-light photography. As we are now a developed civilization and spend a good deal of our time indoors, a camera that excels at low light has enormous appeal, particularly for night owls, barflies, and party-goers. It may not grab the same headlines, but it could well be more useful.

“Bruised” mobile carriers such as AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) are “fighting back” against Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone, despite the fact that the device has helped them eke out consistently higher average revenue per wireless subscribers since its launch, The Wall Street Journal reports. To hear the carriers tell it, the iPhone is a major inhibitor to their profits as last year they were “only” generating wireless service profit margins in the 38% to 42% range.But ever since these beleaguered companies started “fighting back” by implementing data caps, increasing fees for device upgrades and implementing longer waiting periods before users can switch devices, they’ve seen their wireless service profit margins surge. AT&T reported a 45% margin in Q2 2012 and Verizon reported a record-high 49% margin.Simply put, users shouldn’t expect their carriers to stop cranking up fees or do away with data caps anytime soon because such practices are making the carriers a lot of money.

Thanks for the memoriesApple has cut down its order of memory chips from Samsung, reducing its reliance on its smartphone rival for components, say supply chain sources cited by Reuters.The iPhone 5, widely expected to be announced next week, will feature fewer Samsung components than its predecessors, say the sources.Samsung manufactures the A5 and A5X processors at the heart of the iPhone 4S and iPads 2 and 3, but the RAM layer in the chip package will no longer be from Samsung, and the NAND flash memory used in iPad, iPhone and iPod will be from elsewhere too.Instead Apple has increased orders of DRAM chips and NAND flash memory from SK Hynix, Toshiba and Elpida Memory – which are all existing contractors.We already knew that the new iPhone 5 will feature fewer Samsung components, with the screen manufactured by Sharp and LG for the first time, but this means that the memory will come from elsewhere too. Samsung is still expected to make the main processor for the phone.Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of memory chips in the world - recently investing £4bn in its chip-making plant in Austin, Texas, where the A5 chips are made.It will be a welcome move for Toshiba at least. In July, the world's second biggest NAND chip-maker announced a 30 per cut in flash memory chip production, pinned at the time on market oversupply and declining prices.In April this year, Apple reported that it was committed to £11bn in parts and component expenditure. ®

There's plenty of talk making the rounds about Steve Jobs' comments about Android in the authorized biography that's coming out next week. In it, Jobs apparently makes it clear that he was absolutely furious about Android "ripping off" the iPhone. According to the summary in the Huffington Post:This is coming from Steve Jobs, who was inspired by the graphical user interface he saw at Xerox PARC and turned that into the Macintosh. Now, as we've noted before, what Jobs was always great at doing wasn't just taking an idea and copying it, but making it better . But, many would argue that's the same thing that Google has done with Android. Yes, they clearly took inspiration from the iPhone, but there are some key differences, which many people enjoy. In fact, Steve Jobs pretty much admitted this very fact earlier this year when some of the iPhone's upgrades appeared to be copied directly from Android And that's kind of the point: part of the way innovation works is that you build on the works of others. That doesn't just mean wholesale copying, but trying to take what works and improve on it -- or take what doesn't work well and figure out a way to make it work better. Steve Jobs did this many, many times, but so have Google and many other companies. It seems rather hypocritical to get all bent out of shape because others are doing the same thing. Along those lines, Daring Fireball links to a wonderful discussion on this topic by designer Brian Ford, who discusses the idea of "artists copying or stealing" from one another. I completely agree with those points. It's quite similar to an earlier post we did about the importance of getting it right rather than being first, which pointed to a wonderful comic from Scott Meyer's Basic Instructions that included this panel: So I'm at a loss as to Jobs' complaint against Android. At best, the only logical way to view his complaint is that he was upset that Google didn't do on top of the idea of the iPhone to make Android completely its own. But I think that's more of a difference in philosophy. Steve Jobs came from a very top down world view, in which the brilliant designers (him, Jonathan Ive, etc.) designed everything perfectly. Google's world view seems to be more about setting up the system, and then letting others design the improvements. That's messier, clunkier, and a hell of a lot uglier at first. But in the long run, I think it tends to lead to much greater innovation. Just not the kind of innovation you unveil as "and one more thing..." In the end, the best way to sum all this up comes from the T.S. Eliot quote that Ford puts at the end of his blog post. Many people have heard the paraphrased version (often copied and attributed to others) that "good artists copy, great artists steal." But the full T.S. Eliot quote is much more interesting and nuanced:

The next time you’re at a concert and you whip out your iPhone to record  the excitement, you may notice it doesn’t work. During the show you keep trying to turn it on but for some reason it just won't light-up.But miraculously when you go outside when the concert is over, your phone all of a sudden works again. This can happen to you at the next concert you attend or maybe inside the next movie theater you go to.Apple has received a patent that would allow the company to turn off its mobile devices in areas that are deemed inappropriate for recording or taking pictures. The new technology would also have the ability to shut down communication functions in devices, so people couldn’t text or make phone calls if they’re in areas that are considered sensitive.Many believe this new patent could be a good thing, as it can remove the power from movie bootleggers or cut off communication from a group of up-to-no-gooders in an airport let’s say, but it could also harm the public’s ability to document wrongdoing.Remember the kids who were pepper-sprayed at the University of California Davis during the Occupy Wall Street rallies? The students were sitting peacefully but were sprayed at close range, while hundreds of smartphones filmed the incident, which was eventually broadcast around the world.Well, this type of amateur-video journalism could be halted, as certain entities could have the power to abruptly shut off your phone during protest marches, rallies or political gatherings. Those same entities could also just block off satellite signals so you couldn’t get smartphone access in certain places.The federal government along with Apple could arbitrarily decide what areas or public functions would be considered sensitive or restricted. Some believe the amount of subjectivity that goes into making such a decision is as big as the sea, which is the reason they're concerned about this new technology.Although the patent was granted, Apple would still need the okay from the  government to implement the technology, but the company is well on its way to using it in the near future.Some have already expressed concern over not being able to monitor police action, especially during public protests."Covert police government operations may require complete ‘blackout’ conditions," said the patent. "The wireless transmission of sensitive information to a remote source is one of the examples of a threat to security. This sensitive information could be anything from classified government information to questions or answers to an examination administered in an academic setting.”Apple also noted having the ability to shut off smartphones is ideal for professional and some social settings, where devices could easily bother many people at once.“As wireless devices such as cellular telephones, pagers, personal media devices and smartphones become ubiquitous, more and more people are carrying these devices in various social and professional settings,” it says in the patent. “The result is that these wireless devices can often annoy, frustrate, and even threaten people in sensitive venues.”Apple also says smartphones should be disabled within photography darkrooms and biological labs, where light can destroy what’s being worked on.Apple also says the new technology can help drivers as they attempt to use their devices on the road. The company says the smartphone’s communication function could be temporarily deactivated when entering your car or when you're driving in certain areas. Devices would be manipulated by GPS signals and satellites.Now just which entities will have the authority to deem areas sensitive remains to be seen. Whether it’s only Apple, areas of the U.S. government, or local police departments, setting up the technology nationwide is challenging, but extremely doable.The fact that Apple has already been granted a patent by the governent, shows that having your smartphone manipulated by someone other than yourself could be happening sooner than you think.

When Barack Obama joined Silicon Valley’s top luminaries for dinner in California last February, each guest was asked to come with a question for the president.But as Steven P. Jobs of Apple spoke, President Obama interrupted with an inquiry of his own: what would it take to make iPhones in the United States?Not long ago, Apple boasted that its products were made in America. Today, few are. Almost all of the 70 million iPhones, 30 million iPads and 59 million other products Apple sold last year were manufactured overseas.Why can’t that work come home? Mr. Obama asked.Mr. Jobs’s reply was unambiguous. “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he said, according to another dinner guest.The president’s question touched upon a central conviction at Apple. It isn’t just that workers are cheaper abroad. Rather, Apple’s executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products.Apple has become one of the best-known, most admired and most imitated companies on earth, in part through an unrelenting mastery of global operations. Last year, it earned over $400,000 in profit per employee, more than Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobil or Google.However, what has vexed Mr. Obama as well as economists and policy makers is that Apple — and many of its high-technology peers — are not nearly as avid in creating American jobs as other famous companies were in their heydays.Apple employs 43,000 people in the United States and 20,000 overseas, a small fraction of the over 400,000 American workers at General Motors in the 1950s, or the hundreds of thousands at General Electric in the 1980s. Many more people work for Apple’s contractors: an additional 700,000 people engineer, build and assemble iPads, iPhones and Apple’s other products. But almost none of them work in the United States. Instead, they work for foreign companies in Asia, Europe and elsewhere, at factories that almost all electronics designers rely upon to build their wares.“Apple’s an example of why it’s so hard to create middle-class jobs in the U.S. now,” said Jared Bernstein, who until last year was an economic adviser to the White House.“If it’s the pinnacle of capitalism, we should be worried.”Apple executives say that going overseas, at this point, is their only option. One former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone’s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight.A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company’s dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day.“The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,” the executive said. “There’s no American plant that can match that.”Similar stories could be told about almost any electronics company — and outsourcing has also become common in hundreds of industries, including accounting, legal services, banking, auto manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.But while Apple is far from alone, it offers a window into why the success of some prominent companies has not translated into large numbers of domestic jobs. What’s more, the company’s decisions pose broader questions about what corporate America owes Americans as the global and national economies are increasingly intertwined.“Companies once felt an obligation to support American workers, even when it wasn’t the best financial choice,” said Betsey Stevenson, the chief economist at the Labor Department until last September. “That’s disappeared. Profits and efficiency have trumped generosity.”

And so it begins. The so-called iPhone 4 "death grip" has resulted in a class-action lawsuit, filed Wednesday on behalf of two Maryland residents who accused Apple and AT&T of negligence, fraud, and deceptive trade practices, among other things.Kevin McCaffrey and Linda Wrinn pre-ordered the iPhone 4 on June 15 and said the devices they received were "defective.""[They] have experienced numerous dropped calls, and as a result, [they] are left with a device that cannot be used for the normal purpose and in the normal manner in which such devices are intended to be used," according to court documents.Two more class-action lawsuits were filed in San Francisco a day earlier, separate cases that also alleged that Apple shipped the iPhone 4 with an unannounced defect, Bloomberg reported.The iPhone 4 started shipping to customers in late June. Reports soon emerged that holding the phone with fingers covering the three black lines on the phone's edge and the bottom left corner caused its data reception to plummet. This "iPhone 4 death grip" was replicated in the PCMag Labs, but Apple later said that "gripping any phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance."Placing a cover on the device apparently eliminates death grip issues. Apple is also reportedly prepping a software update that will alleviate connection problems.Steve Jobs also weighed in on the death grip rumors. An Engadget reader e-mailed the Apple chief executive complaining that he loses reception when he places his hands on the steel bands. "Just avoid holding it that way," Jobs responded.That e-mail exchange made its way into Wednesday's class-action lawsuit, which also mentions a similar response to a Gizmodo reader as evidence of Apple's negligence.McCaffrey and Wrinn both pre-ordered two iPhone 4's on or around June 15. McCaffrey received his on June 24; Wrinn received hers three days ago."Almost immediately after the purchase of their iPhone 4 devices, both McCaffrey and Wrinn began to experience significantly reduced reception and performance when handling the phones as demonstrated in Apple's advertisements or as a reasonable person would handle a mobile telephone while making phone calls, browsing the Internet, sending text messages, or utilizing other services provided by the iPhone 4," the suit said.The suit pointed to advertisements promising improved reception and improved service overall as examples of both companies' deceptive trade practices.The duo cannot return their phones without incurring a re-stocking fee, the court said. Apple charges a 10 percent re-stocking fee on any opened hardware or accessory, according to its Web site.As a result, McCaffrey and Wrinn are suing for damages "and other remedies."Overall, the suit accuses Apple of defect in design, manufacturer, and assembly as well as breach of express warranty. Apple and AT&T are accused of general negligence, breach of warranty, deceptive trade practices, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud by concealment.In related news, there are also rumors that a California lawsuit is prepping an iPhone 4 class-action suit of its own. Gawker posted a link to the Web site for law firm Kershaw, Cutter & Ratinoff, which is looking for people who are having iPhone 4 reception problems.This is not the first reception-related lawsuit Apple has faced over the iPhone. In August 2008, an Alabama woman filed a class-action lawsuit against Apple over reception and speed problems with the iPhone 3G. That was followed by another suit in September 2008, which cited the same issues.Editor's Note: This story was updated at 11:47 AM PT with details of the additional lawsuits.

A new "jailbreak" for the iPhone 3GS and iPad was released this weekend by hackers, and allows users to run third-party software with features not authorized by Apple, including multitasking.Dubbed "Spirit," the software for Windows and Mac OS X allows users to jailbreak their iPhone OS device , including firmware 3.1.2, 3.1.3, and the iPad-exclusive 3.2. The practice of jailbreaking allows users to run code not approved by Apple on their mobile device. The hack was released by a coder who goes by the handle "comex," and is a member of the Dev Team group. They, along with George "Geohot" Hotz, are the most high-profile hackers of the iPhone OS. The Spirit jailbreak was first demonstrated on the iPad in early April. The release was delayed until after the iPad 3G went on sale last Friday to ensure it would work with the new hardware. The jailbreak installs Cydia, an unauthorized digital storefront that is the hackers' equivalent of Apple's own App Store. It includes unauthorized software such as "Backgrounder," which allows users to run more than one application at once. Early reports indicate that Backgrounder works on the iPad, though most other Cydia software created for the iPhone must be updated to run on the larger 9.7-inch screen. Previously, many iPhone 3GS users could only use a "tethered" jailbreak released by Hotz. This method meant users of the latest iPod touch, and any iPhone 3GS released in October 2009 or later, could not perform a hardware reset of the phone without connecting it via USB cable to a computer. The Spirit jailbreak is not tethered. Last year, Apple updated the BootROM for the iPhone 3GS to iBoot-359.32 in a mid-cycle hardware release in October -- the first time ever that the handset maker modified its hardware in the middle of a product line, without a new model released. That update has slowed hackers in their ongoing game of cat and mouse with Apple. Apple and the jailbreaking community have gone back and forth for some time, as the Cupertino, Calif., company has looked to close avenues used by hackers. One of Apple's main concerns about jailbreaking is piracy, as the procedure can allow users to steal software from the App Store, in addition to running unauthorized third-party applications.

Sometime around the middle of this decade no one is sure exactly when -- executives on the go will begin carrying pocket-sized digital communicating devices. And although nobody is exactly sure what features these personal information gizmos will have, what they will cost, what they will look like or what they will be called, hundreds of computer industry officials and investors at the Mobile '92 conference here last week agreed that the devices could become the foundation of the next great fortunes to be made in the personal computer business."We are writing Chapter 2 of the history of personal computers," said Nobuo Mii, vice president and general manager of the International Business Machines Corporation's entry systems division.How rich is this lode? At one end of the spectrum is John Sculley, the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., who says these personal communicators could be "the mother of all markets."At the other end is Andrew Grove, the chairman of the Intel Corporation, the huge chip maker based in Santa Clara, Calif. He says the idea of a wireless personal communicator in every pocket is "a pipe dream driven by greed."These devices are expected to combine the best features of personal computers, facsimile machines, computer networks, pagers, personal secretaries, appointment books, address books and even paperback books and pocket CD players -- all in a hand-held box operated by pen, or even voice commands.Stuck in traffic on a business trip, an executive carrying a personal communicator could send and receive electronic mail and facsimile messages from anywhere in the country. She could also call up a local map on a 3-inch by 5-inch screen, draw a line between her current position (confirmed by satellite positioning signals) and her intended destination, and the device would give her specific driving instructions (as well as real-time warnings about traffic jams or accidents). Certainly, these are just predictions for now, but they sure are fun to think about.Once in the meeting, the executive could take notes on the device, and even order pizza for the group using a combination of custom electronic forms and wireless fax. After updating her schedule electronically and sending notes back to her office computer network, she could check restaurant and movie information, including critics' reviews. Back at the hotel, she could plug in the latest disk-based novel.A number of demonstrations at the conference, some using real products and some relying on imagination, explored the potential of these machines."It's not boiling yet, but we're starting to see bubbles," said Alain Rossmann, president and chief executive of EO, a secretive new high-technology company in Foster City, Calif."But it ain't soup yet," responded one skeptic in the crowded room.Many of the technologies needed to create these personal communicators already exist. Participants at the conference bristled with tiny cellular phones, digital beepers, notebook computers, Sharp Wizards or other simple electronic data books, and the occasional old-fashioned paper pad.William J. Warwick, president of A.T.& T. Microelectronics, showed how he currently uses some of the technology that will be incorporated in tomorrow's personal digital assistants, and it was not a pretty sight. He started by emptying his overstuffed briefcase: a portable computer (with a fax modem), a backup battery, a battery charger, cellular telephone, a backup battery for the phone, another battery charger, some wires for connecting the modem to a telephone outlet, an external floppy disk drive, a digital pager, an AC power adapter, some power cords and the usual paper notebooks.

The redesigned Apple TV cost $64 to make and its internal design and key components are almost exactly the same as Apple's iPad, iPhone 4, and iPod Touch, a teardown analysis showed.The recently released, second-generation device for streaming video, music, and video over a Wi-Fi connection to a flat-panel TV is a dramatic departure from the previous product, which was built like a mini-computer, iSuppli said in releasing its report Tuesday. The current product has the same A4 processor core, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip, and power management chip that are the building blocks of the iPad tablet, iPhone 4 smartphone, and iPod Touch media player."The first Apple TV was built like a net-top computer. The architecture was basically a stripped down, small-form-factor desktop PC," said Andrew Rassweiler, teardown analyst for iSuppli, said in a statement. "The second generation Apple TV is more like an iPad or iPod Touch with no display."The new Apple TV carries a bill of materials of $61.98, based on a preliminary estimate by iSuppli. When manufacturing costs are added, the production cost rises to $63.95, which doesn't include research and development, software, licensing, and royalties.Where Apple sold the first-generation product at a price close to the underlying hardware costs, the latest product, which costs $99, has a significantly improved ratio of hardware cost to retail price. Nevertheless, for Apple, the margin is much less than that for other Apple products, iSuppli said.The most clever design element with the latest Apple TV is in the handheld remote control, which represents "more incredible mechanical engineering from Apple," Rassweiler said."The remote appears to be machined from a solid piece of aluminum," the analyst said. "Because of this, the electronics of the device must be slid in through small holes on the side, similar to putting a ship in a bottle. It's a clever and a detail-oriented piece of design that makes the remote very pricey and very unique to Apple."As in other recent Apple designs, Samsung Electronics is the marquee component supplier for the Apple TV. Samsung makes the Apple-designed A4 application processor and the chip that holds the device's system memory. Combined, the technology is the most expensive section of the device at a cost of $16.55 or nearly 27% of the bill of materials.The second most expensive subsystem is the 8 GB of NAND flash used mostly for storing media. Toshiba was the supplier of the $14 subsystem in the unit torn down by iSuppli.The server market is changing rapidly. In this report, we look into the technological advances driving the server market forward, as well as the server strategies of Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Oracle-Sun, Cisco, and other vendors.

(CNN) -- For years tech pundits have been searching for an "iPhone" killer -- a mythical new device that would dethrone Apple's mighty handset as the most admired or popular smartphone.It may be already here.For the first time, Samsung's Galaxy S III overtook Apple's iPhone 4S to become the world's best-selling smartphone model for the third quarter (July through September) of 2012, according to new research by Strategy Analytics.The Galaxy S III shipped 18 million units worldwide, compared with 16.2 million for the iPhone 4S. That's 11% of all smartphones shipped on the planet.Yes, this is the phone inthose mocking TV ads that show annoying fanboys and fangirls in a thinly disguised Apple store line, obsessing over their impending purchase while a happy Galaxy S III owner saves a place in line ... for his parents.Released in May, the Android-based Galaxy S III boasts a bigger touchscreen and longer battery life than the iPhone 4S, along with more megapixels in its camera and the ability to run on 4G cellular networks. Some tech sites have rated it the best smartphone on the market.But the Galaxy S III reign atop the sales rankings will likely be short-lived. As Strategy Analytics pointed out, iPhone 4S sales waned in the third quarter as consumers waited for the iPhone 5, which went on sale September 21.Apple sold 5 million iPhone 5s that first weekend and is expected to sell many millions more during this holiday shopping season.

Google intends to continue Motorola Mobility’s demands for 2.25-percent of Apple’s iPhone sales in royalties, the search giant has revealed, once its acquisition of the smartphone manufacturer goes through. Although Google’s letter to the IEE standards agency this week ostensibly called for fair patent licensing deals, it also reiterates commitment to maximum 2.25-percent per-unit royalty that Motorola was roundly criticized for, FOSS Patents spotted.“Following Google’s acquisition of MMI [Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.], Google will honor MMI’s existing commitments to license the acquired MMI Essential Patent Claims on RAND [reasonable terms and conditions demonstrable free of any unfair discrimination] terms, as required by IEEE rules and consistent with MMI’s longstanding practice. This letter is irrevocable. Google understand that, pursuant to IEEE rules, MMI is prepared to grant licenses for Essential Patent Claims with a maximum per-unit royalty of 2.25-percent of the net selling price for the relevant end product on a go-forward basis, subject to offsets for the value of any cross-licenses or other consideration received from the licensee” Allen Lo, Deputy General Counsel, GoogleApple has argued that Motorola’s fee demands are excessive, and that its rivals are not following FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) guidelines in a similar way to that which sparked an EC investigation into potential antitrust behavior by Samsung. The Cupertino company’s legal team has also sought disclosure from other smartphone manufacturers as to how much they’ve agreed to pay Motorola in licensing fees, though it’s possible Motorola could argue that the reciprocal licensing means the deals are non-comparable.Meanwhile, Google’s stance on potential injunctions is apparently unchanged from Motorola Mobility’s existing approach: that is, to apply for an injunction if licensees don’t agree to its royalty terms. If, it’s suggested, the 2.25-percent referred solely to the specific component the patented technology was applied in – for instance, a baseband 3G/UMTS radio chipset – then that might be reasonable, but Motorola is chasing 2.25-percent of the entire end-product, i.e. almost $15 on the unsubsidized price of each entry-level iPhone 4S.The decision as to whether Google is allowed to acquire Motorola Mobility is expected to be reached on February 13.

A security researcher has discovered that any wireless network can pretend to be an AT&T Wi-Fi hot spot and thus lure unsuspecting iPhone users to an untrusted network connection.Samy Kamkar, who created a worm that garnered him a million friends on MySpace overnight in 2005, said in an interview this week that he can hijack any iPhone within Wi-Fi range in what is often dubbed a "man-in-the-middle" attack because of the way the devices are configured to recognize AT&T Wi-Fi connections merely by the name "attwifi."Typically, an iPhone will look for a specific MAC address--the unique identifier for the router--to verify that the wireless network is a device a user agreed to join previously, according to Kamkar. However, if the iPhone has previously connected to any one of the numerous free AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots (offered at virtually every Starbucks in the U.S., for example) the device will ignore what the MAC address says and simply connect to the network if it has "AT&T Wifi" attached, he said."The iPhone joins the network by name with no other form of authentication," he said.Kamkar said he made this discovery recently when he was at a Starbucks and disconnected from the AT&T Wi-Fi network."I went into the settings to disconnect and the prompt was different from normal," he said. "I went home and had my computer pretend to be an AT&T hot spot just by the name and my iPhone continued to connect to it. I saw one or two other iPhones hop onto the network, too, going through my laptop computer. I could redirect them, steal credentials as they go to Web sites," among other stealth moves, if he had wanted to.To prove that a hijack is possible, Kamkar wrote a program that displays messages and can make other modifications when someone is attempting to use the Google Maps program on an iPhone that has been intercepted. He will be releasing his hijacking program via his Twitter account: http://twitter.com/samykamkar.Kamkar hasn't attempted the hijack on an iPod Touch, but plans to determine whether it has the same vulnerability.iPhone users can protect themselves by disabling their Wi-Fi, or they can turn off the automatic joining of the AT&T Wi-Fi network, but only if the device is within range of an existing AT&T hot spot, Kamkar said.Asked for comment an Apple spokeswoman said: "iPhone performs properly as a Wi-Fi device to automatically join known networks. Customers can also choose to select to 'Forget This Network' after using a hot spot so the iPhone doesn't join another network of the same name automatically."Kamkar, an independent researcher based in Los Angeles, first made a name for himself by launching what was called the "Samy" worm on MySpace in order to see how quickly he could get friends on the social-networking site. The cross-site scripting (XSS) worm displayed the words "Samy is my hero" on a victim's profile and when others viewed the page they were infected.He served three years of probation under a plea agreement reached in early 2007 for releasing the worm.

Pre-orders for the iPhone 5 went live at midnight and, true to form, they went like hotcakes. You may remember that it took 22 hours for the iPhone 4S and about 20 hours for the iPhone 4 to sell out of its pre-order, launch-day stock.The iPhone 5 took just about 60 minutes. Yep. One hour after pre-orders went live, Apple.com adjusted shipping expectations from one to two weeks due to the overwhelming demand.Demand for the phone caused problems on Apple’s website and several of the wireless carriers’ sites, as many users were met with error messages when they attempted to pre-order the new iPhone. There’s always plenty of hubbub around Apple product launches, though the pre-order launch of the iPhone 4S came and went without problems on Apple.com or carrier sites. It wouldn’t be surprising if this turns out to be an indication of what’s to come.All summer we were subjected to seemingly endless speculation and rumors regarding every last detail of the new, new iPhone. But, when it was finally unveiled this week, the reviews — which, while still characterized by the usual fanboi excitement — seemed more lukewarm than in years past. Even compared to the recent iPad/Mac event.As is so often the case with Apple, the new phone looks great, with the bigger screen and improved speed ranking as my personal favorites. Yet, that being said, I haven’t yet seen the kind of mind-melting innovation and improvement that would justify pre-orders 20 times faster than the 4 and 4S.Nonetheless, people are still ready to buy it in what will no doubt be massive numbers.“Available to ship: 2 weeks”… man that last week it’s gonna feel like you have an old cement block in your pocket.I guess I shouldn’t be surprised anymore that Apple product launches somehow continue to exceed expectations, the machine reliably churning out another hit. But I am. Mostly because of how rampant the obsession is to buy the next generation of iPhone as soon as possible.MG Siegler wrote yesterday about the way Apple showcases these events, discussing the turn and the prestige. But a couple of sentences really jumped out at me beyond the presentation of the phone.That’s what really matters. The bottom line sits atop everything else. And the bottom line is that, despite the phone not having any of those drastic changes some hoped for (NFC?) and a lack of an overwhelming “wow” factor, so many people went online at midnight or past — on a work night no less — to shell out hundreds of dollars for a pre-order jubilee that had sites crashing and the first batch selling out in 60 minutes.That’s why Apple is the most valuable company in the world.The question is: The iPhone 4S had Siri, which captured our attention in full, even if she’s been a disappointment since … so what feature or tool will be that for the 5?Update: The ship time on Apple’s site is now 2-3 weeks:And Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told AllThingsD: “Pre-orders for iPhone 5 have been incredible. We’ve been completely blown away by the customer response.”

In the last five weeks, Apple has revamped its entire product lineup with new iPods, iPhones and computers. But on Thursday it said those products would be more expensive to make, nibbling into its ample profits.That forecast for the holiday quarter was the main blemish on an otherwise solid financial report. Apple said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 24 percent, largely because of a surge in sales of the iPhone, a product that now accounts for nearly half of the company’s sales.The quarter ended Sept. 29 was the first to reflect sales of the iPhone 5, which was introduced Sept. 21. Apple has struggled to deliver enough of the devices to meet customer demand, making them tough to find in many retail stores. The company’s shares have fallen 9 percent since the product hit the market, in part because of investor concerns about short supply.In a conference call with analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said that demand for the new iPhone was “extremely robust” and that the company had a significant number of back orders for it. He said production had picked up substantially since earlier this month.The profit report was slightly below analysts’ expectations, and Apple’s stock was largely unchanged in after-hours trading. It fell 1.2 percent to $609.54 in regular trading.Underscoring how drastically Apple’s business has been transformed by mobile products, revenue from the iPhone rose 56 percent to $17.13 billion, making up 48 percent of the company’s total revenue. It sold 26.9 million iPhones, 58 percent more than a year earlier.Apple said its net income was $8.22 billion, or $8.67 a share, compared with $6.62 billion, or $7.05 a share, a year ago. Revenue for the period rose 27 percent to $35.97 billion, and revenue for the full fiscal year was $156.5 billion. To put that in perspective, Apple’s revenue for the year exceeded that of Microsoft, Google and Facebook combined.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Apple to report earnings of $8.75 a share and revenue of $35.8 billion. The results were well ahead of Apple’s own forecast of $7.65 a share in earnings and $34 billion in revenue for the period.It was the company’s projections for its current holiday quarter that raised eyebrows among investors. The company forecast earnings of $11.75 a share and revenue of $52 billion for the period, typically its biggest of the year. That implied a gross profit margin of 36 percent, lower than the 40 percent margin Apple reported in the fourth quarter, said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Apple executives attributed the decline to higher costs associated with building its new products, which tend to get less expensive over time as Apple gets better at manufacturing them. While this pattern is familiar, the company said the sheer magnitude of its product-line overhaul made the decline in gross margin more severe. In addition to the new iPhone and iPods, Apple has announced new Macs and a smaller version of the iPad, called the iPad Mini.Mr. Cihra said the company might be lowballing its estimates. “They have a history of beating their guidance,” he said.Apple said its revenue from the iPad rose 9 percent to $7.51 billion.As with most Apple products, the iPad Mini’s arrival was widely anticipated after months of rumors and leaks about the product in the news media. Mr. Cook said the rumors led people to postpone tablet purchases.At the iPad Mini event, Apple hinted that sales of the iPad had been slower than expected when it revealed that the company had sold 100 million of the devices since their introduction two years ago, causing some analysts to trim their forecasts for the quarter.“I think on balance it was pretty in line with reduced expectations,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.At a starting price of $329, the iPad Mini is more expensive than many people were hoping, and well above the sub-$200 bar for smaller tablets set by Amazon and Google. But the device could still open the iPad to a new swath of customers who were put off by the larger size of the original.

Private information stored in Apple's iPhone and protected by a lock code can be accessed by anyone with just a few button presses.The iPhone, like most mobile phones, can be locked with a four-digit code, but where other phones in their locked state only permit calls to emergency service numbers such as 911 (in the U.S.), 999 (in the U.K.) and 112 (throughout Europe), a locked iPhone can be used to make a call to any number.[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes' Security Adviser blog and newsletter, both from InfoWorld. ]However, that's not all you can do with a locked iPhone running the latest version of Apple's software, 2.0.2.Pressing the emergency call button at the unlock screen, followed by two taps on the home button, takes you to the iPhone's private 'favorites' page without the need to enter the unlock code. If the owner of the phone has favorite entries in their address book containing URLs, e-mail addresses or mobile phone numbers, then those entries can be used to launch the browser, mail application or SMS (Short Message Service) software, and gain access to private Web favorites, e-mail messages, and text messages stored in the phone, again without entering the unlock code.The security flaw, revealed by a member of the MacRumors.com forum, came as a surprise to an Apple spokeswoman in London, who said she would look into the matter.One way to avoid such unauthorized access to e-mail messages or Web favorites would be not to add e-mail addresses or URLs to favorite address book entries.Apple pushed version 2.0 of its iPhone software as being more enterprise-friendly: some businesses had been reluctant to adopt the first version of the iPhone because it did not adequately protect corporate information stored in the device.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — A federal judge says a monopoly abuse lawsuit against Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc.'s mobile phone unit can move forward as a class action.The lawsuit consolidates several filed by iPhone buyers starting in late 2007, a few months after the first generation of Apple's smart phone went on sale.An amended complaint filed in June 2008 takes issue with Apple's practice of "locking" iPhones so they can only be used on AT&T's network, and its absolute control over what applications iPhone owners can and cannot install on the gadgets.The lawsuit also says Apple secretly made AT&T its exclusive iPhone partner in the U.S. for five years. Consumers agreed to two-year contracts with the Dallas-based wireless carrier when they purchased their phones, but were in effect locked into a five-year relationship with AT&T, the lawsuit argued.The actions hurt competition and drove up prices for consumers, the lawsuit claims.Apple and AT&T have not commented on the terms of their deal. In its response to the complaint, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it did not hurt competition.In court documents filed July 8, Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said parts of the lawsuit that deal with violations to antitrust law can continue as a class action. The class includes anyone who bought an iPhone with a two-year AT&T agreement since the device first went on sale in June 2007.Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones in the last three years. The company does not specify how many have gone to U.S. customers.Ware dismissed other claims against Apple, among them allegations that the company broke laws when an update to the iPhone's operating software caused some phones to stop working and deleted programs that users had purchased.The lawsuit seeks an injunction to keep Apple from selling locked iPhones in the U.S. and from determining what iPhone programs people can install. It also seeks damages to cover legal fees and other costs.

FRUIT THEMED FIRM Apple's Iphone and Ipad could be banned in Germany after Motorola won a temporary injunction in the Mannheim Regional Court.The case, which relates to Motorola's wireless technology patents, represents a huge loss for Apple in its tit for tat patent battles taking place around the world.However, in typical fashion, Apple immediately said it would appeal the ruling. It said, "We're going to appeal the court's ruling right away. Holiday shoppers in Germany should have no problem finding the iPad or iPhone they want."According to patent gadfly Florian Mueller, the ruling includes an injunction that is preliminarily enforceable against Ireland-based Apple Sales International in exchange for a €100mn (£85.4mn or $134m) bond unless Apple wins a stay.He said on his blog, "Apple is certainly going to appeal this ruling to the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court and to request a stay for the duration of the appellate proceedings. Such a suspension may or may not be granted."Apple suffered another loss today when an Australian court lifted a ban on the Samsung Galaxy Tab in Australia. µ

Responding to a string of complaints, Apple said that the error overstated the phone's signal strength, causing it to appear to lose more reception than it actually does when gripped a certain way.Angry owners said that when they grip it via its lower left-hand corner, the phone drops several bars of signal."We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising," the company wrote in a letter."Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength."Apple's CEO Steve Jobs last week told people complaining about the issue to simply hold their phone a different way.Earlier this week, the company stated that "gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas".It now says the combination of the effect of gripping the phone, plus the error in the way signal is displayed on the iPhone 4, is what is causing some users to report a drop of several bars."Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars."Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place," Apple said Friday.The company said that it wouldl issue a software update within a few weeks to fix the issue, adding: "We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same - the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped."Several users have filed lawsuits over the reception issue.

Microsoft and Apple are said to be discussing a deal that would see Microsoft Bing become the default search engine on Apple's iPhone.The move, according to a published report, would result in the ouster of Google as the main search portal on the iPhone.Apple may be looking to ditch Google from its devices in response to Google's launch of an iPhone competitor, dubbed Nexus One, earlier this month, according to BusinessWeek. The story said Microsoft might also be looking to make Bing the default search tool on Apple's Safari Web browser.Like the iPhone, the Nexus One features downloadable apps and an interactive touch screen. But unlike Apple, Google plans to sell an open version of the $529 phone that's not linked to a specific carrier."Apple and Google know the other is their primary enemy," said an anonymous source quoted by BusinessWeek in a story published Wednesday. The magazine said the source had knowledge of Apple's plans.It was not immediately clear how much traffic the iPhone generates for Google, but the number could be significant as the iPhone dominates the North American mobile device market.Microsoft and Apple officials didn't comment for the story.If such a deal plays out, it could provide a marked boost for Microsoft's search business. Bing captured just 10.7% of all U.S. search traffic in December, according to market watcher Comscore, while Google, the number one player, took 65.7% of all traffic. Second place Yahoo grabbed 17.3%.Microsoft already has a deal in place to add Bing to Yahoo's Web pages.Microsoft shares were off 2.03%, to $30.47, in morning trading Wednesday. Apple was down 1.65%, to $211.49, while Google was off by 1.41%, to $579.35, as the markets opened lower on concerns about bank earnings.Still shackling your workers to a standard company PC?

AT&T captivity is the single biggest reason foks who don't buy iPhones don't buy them, so this would be big. It would also be unexpectedly early--most analysts aren't expecting Apple to open up to other carriers until the middle of the year.(We'd be surprised to see Apple actually end the exclusivity on Wednesday, but it seems plausible that they would announce the end...)According to an inside source close to the going-ons involved in all of this, a new tablet of some sort may not be the only thing on deck for next Wednesday though. We have been led to believe by an inside source that AT&T will lose their iPhone exclusivity on the same day, though it's not yet clear what other carrier (or carriers) will be stepping in to also carry the phone.Bonus: 20 guesses about what the Apple tablet will look like >

One of the world’s largest oilfield companies, Halliburton, publicly acknowledged its decision to stop giving workers BlackBerrys and start equipping them with iPhones. This is a gigantic blow to Research in Motion because the BlackBerry has for a very long time been widely considered the best phone for enterprise users. Halliburton obviously disagrees and so will many other companies if RIM doesn’t step its game up in time.Spokesperson for Halliburton, Tara Mullee Agard, said to Reuters in an email, “We are making this transition in order to better support our mobile applications initiatives.” The transition she speaks of is the movement from BlackBerry to iPhone over the next two years for 4,500 employees. She also pointed out Apple is helping the company with the process.Apple didn’t just steal a large amount of candy from RIM, it’s getting the dirty pleasure of chewing slowly right in front of RIM.BlackBerry advocates, you are now presented with a challenge: come up with a better excuse than “BlackBerry devices are for business users.” I’m afraid that argument is no longer valid. Oh, and since BlackBerry isn’t so hot with consumers either, what exactly is the target market? Please hurry. The BlackBerry Bold Team is waiting for its next mission.George has followed technology news for quite some time, but he only started writing about it a few years ago.

We always knew the Apple / Samsung lawsuit would produce some major fireworks, and Samsung just lit off a corker: the company filed a motion Friday night asking Apple to turn over the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 as part of the discovery process. Seriously! Samsung claims that it needs to see Apple's future products because devices like the Droid Charge and Galaxy Tab 10.1 will presumably be in the market at the same time as the iPhone 5 and iPad 3, and Samsung's lawyers want to evaluate any possible similarities so they can prepare for further potential legal action from Apple. It's ballsy, but it's not totally out of the blue: the move comes just a few days after the judge ordered Samsung to hand over pre-production samples of the Droid Charge, Infuse 4G, Galaxy S II, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 so Apple could determine if those products should also be part of the lawsuit and potentially file a motion to block them from the market.Now, the key difference between the two requests is that Samsung had already announced its products, while Apple has maintained its traditional iron silence about future devices. But there's some additional nuance involved as well, as well as some bigger-picture implications -- let's walk through the entire situation, shall we?Now, given that most of the Samsung products on the list were already either available or fully disclosed, it wasn't surprising that Apple won -- in fact, it's more interesting that Samsung had chose to fight back on such a minor issue in the first place, since it had so little at stake. (And it's also somewhat interesting that Apple even asked for Samsung's products in discovery instead of just filing for an injunction from the get-go, since they had all been announced already.) It's a tell: no little compromises means no big compromises are in the works. So now let's step through Samsung's motion to see the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 and try to get a sense of what's actually happening in context.So that's Samsung's motion. It's pretty strange, if you think about it: Samsung is arguing that Apple might file for a preliminary injunction, and that it might happen sometime after Apple might release a new iPhone and iPad. That's a lot of assumptions -- and Apple can basically kill this entire line of argument dead by filing for that injunction Monday morning and saying that Samsung's already-announced products should be blocked from market because they'll cause confusion with the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 for however many months remain before the new versions are released. Neither the court nor Samsung really need to see Apple's unreleased products to deal with that. And even if Samsung wins, Apple will definitely appeal the decision, putting the entire case on hold while things get sorted out... a process that will almost certainly stretch past the iPhone 5's expected release in the fall, rendering this entire argument somewhat moot. And what happens if Samsung eventually gets the iPhone 5 and determines that the Droid Charge infringes Apple's patents and trademarks? Is it going to change the Droid Charge? The potential outcomes aren't entirely favorable here.So why is Samsung even pursuing this? I think it's a calculated gamble for additional leverage. Apple and Samsung held negotiations for a year before giving up and heading to the courts, and I'm reliably informed that there haven't been any substantive settlement discussions since Apple first filed its complaint. That means talks have been at a standstill for a long time now, and I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung was trying to put some additional heat on Apple to try and kick negotiations back into gear. It's an interesting and aggressive move in its own right, but it also highlights the fact that neither Apple nor Samsung have addressed the actual merits of their complaints in formal replies -- this is a minor skirmish before the real battle begins. We'll see if this sideshow accomplishes anything beyond clever lawyerly maneuvering, but for right now it's clear that Apple and Samsung aren't planning to back down anytime soon.

Android has officially hit the big time now that sales of its devices exceeded the Apple iPhoneover the past quarter.Briefly, a look at the numbers: Over the span of a mere quarter last year, Android saw its share of the U.S. smartphone market more than double, as the platform was used on more than 7% of all U.S. smartphones at the end of 2009. The most recent research released by the NPD Group showed that Android-based phonesin the first quarter of 2010 accounted for 28% of all smartphone shipments, trailing only Research in Motion's BlackBerry operating system, which accounted for 36% of all smartphone shipments in the quarter. And finally, Android-based phones are now available on all four major U.S. wireless carriers, with the million-selling Motorola Droid so far serving as the platform's flagship device.So how did this all come together so quickly? Looking back over the past three years, it seems that Google had a very simple but effective plan to push its way into a crowded market. Using a combination of free software, design simplicity and brand clout, Google has succeeded in making an operating system that, in just a couple of years, has grown to rival the most popular mobile platforms in the business. Let's take a look at each element piece by piece:* First, make it free. One of the most enticing aspects of Android from both a software developer and a device manufacturer perspective is that it's completely free to use, as Google charges no licensing fees for anyone who wants to base their device or application on Android. This is a distinctly different path than the ones taken by Apple and Research in Motion, which both only allow use of their operating systems on their own devices, and by Microsoft, which only allows devices to use Windows Mobile through a licensing agreement.* Second, keep it simple. When Google went about attracting application developers to its new platform, it made a big deal about the Android software development kit's ease of use. And since Android is Linux platform that uses Java as its programming language, most software developers on the market haven't had much difficulty in writing programs for the operating system.Google has also gone out of its way to make posting a new application on the Android Market a snap, as the company does not screen any applications sent to the store and will only remove applications if it has received legitimate customer complaints about them."We created an account, uploaded our apps and then hit submit," said Ilya Eliashevsky, the product manager for app developer DataViz's Android product line, last year. "Then the app just started showing up on devices and we saw sales immediately starting to roll in."* Finally, be Google. There have been ambitious platform developers in the past who have tried to mainstream open source in the mobile OS market, but none of them so far have had the market clout of Google. Google's brand recognition not only helps it attract media attention to its initiatives but also helps it more quickly develop relationships with device manufacturers, carriers and app developers. In other words, while you obviously need to develop a strong mobile platform that device manufacturers, software developers and consumers want to use, it doesn't hurt to be the world's No.1 search engine either.Read more about anti-malware in Network World's Anti-Malware section.

A new lawsuit alleges AT&T is regularly overcharging iPhone and iPad customers for data usage, in some cases up to 300% more.[ad#Google Adsense 300x250 in story]Lawyers for the lawsuit said they spent $80,000 testing devices in preparation for their day in court. In one instance, lawyers purchased a brand new iPhone and turned off everything that could affect data usage. When the bill came in from AT&T, there were 35 transactions for data usage, according to MSNBC.Lawyers said that AT&T overcharged on every single transaction. Not once did a data usage charge go in favor of the customer. Lawyers said that AT&T systematically overstated data usage by 7-14% and sometimes up to 300%.While they said that individual charges may add up to $10 or $15 a month, with millions of customers, it’s quite a boon for AT&T.One lawyer compared the AT&T charges to a rigged gas pump where you pay for a gallon of gas and only get 9/10 of a gallon.AT&T says the charges are “without merit” and says customers misunderstand how data is charged. The company points to things like automatic app updates in the background that customers may not be aware of.

SAN JOSE -- Apple released late Tuesday its best evidence that Samsung has copied its patents and trade dress, a 132-page Samsung report comparing its handsets to the iPhone.The report methodically compares the iPhone and Samsung's S1 handset across 126 specific features. A page is dedicated to each feature with each page showing side-by-side comparisons of how the iPhone and the S1 implement the feature.At the bottom of each page, the report makes recommendations for how Samsung could improve its handsets. The direction generally is to more closely adopt Apple's practices.Apple sees this document from a product engineering team in Samsung's software verification group as its smoking gun. Samsung counters the document is merely observing and benchmarking best practices in the industry as one aspect of competition.We'll let you decide by looking at some examples of the document below. We invite your comments. Is this evidence of illegal copying or normal industry benchmarking?Let's start with the cover:

In the late '70s, when I was just out of college, and even before I began my career as a journalist, I worked in public relations at Hewlett-Packard Co.These were the final years of HP as "the world's greatest company" under its two founders. ... And being in such comfortable and friendly surroundings and working for such an enlightened employer basically spoiled me for any other job thereafter.Indeed, there were only two problems with that job:1. I didn't want to be a PR man;As it happened, the two were closely related. Simon was a great big, linebacker-sized guy who was both whip-smart and tough. He was a few years older than me and was working for a weekly industry newsprint tabloid called Electronic News. EN was notorious for underpaying its reporters (which was why they were usually young and destined to quickly move on) and for having neither the time nor inclination to do much more editorially than rewrite corporate press releases.That is, until Mark Simon came along.He was as young and transient as the rest of EN's reporters; but he was also clever and fearless. Suddenly, under his byline, stories started appearing the likes of which the electronics trade press, notoriously deferential to the giant companies of the tech world, had never seen. Simon broke insider stories, published internal strategy memos and pre-introduced secret projects, all with seeming abandon ... leaving corporate PR departments, like us at HP, scrambling to do damage control and plug the leaks.As the kid in HP corporate PR department, I both feared Simon for the damage he could do with his breaking stories -- my turf was hugely successful calculator business -- and was in awe of his reporting skills. I also wasn't allowed to talk much with him when he came into our offices for fear I would slip up and accidentally give my counterpart another news hook.It wasn't until years later, when I was a reporter myself (and talked with Mark) that I came to realize that all Simon was doing was just good hard reporting. His techniques ranged from learning to read upside down the memos on executives' desks while conducting interviews, cold calling low-level employees who didn't know better than to talk with the press, pretending to know information to get official confirmation, and the whole rest of the toolkit of good investigative reporting.Mark also told me that the biggest source for his insider information was, in fact, the rising golden boy executive at HP, who got a kick out of making controlled leaks to manipulate the press and his counterparts at the company.Mark went on to become a distinguished political reporter in Sacramento for the San Francisco Chronicle. And, having seen him in action, I redoubled my efforts to become a newspaperman myself -- which I accomplished a couple years later. And in those first years in the newsroom, I tried to pattern myself on what I had seen of Simon in action. He was my gold standard.That was a long time ago. But what's important today about that story is that no matter how furious HP was at Mark Simon's ability to pre-announce its products and expose internal company documents, it never once crossed anyone's mind to call the cops on him.

Cybersecurity researcher Charlie Miller and his fellow researcher Collin Mulliner plan to present research on a huge iPhone security hole Thursday at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. Not an iPhone virus, but rather an SMS hack, the issue can allow a hacker complete control over an iPhone.According to the researchers, they will demonstrate how to send a series of mostly invisible SMS "bursts" that can give a hacker complete control of the iPhone. That control will include dialing the phone, visiting Web sites, turning on the device's camera and microphone, and more. The hacker will also be able to send more text messages to facilitate spreading the iPhone SMS hack to other iPhones.To an end user, the evidence that someone is trying to use the iPhone's SMS hack on your device will be a text message on your iPhone containing only a single square character. The only way to avoid being hacked would be to quickly turn off the device. In terms of the amount of control, this hack sounds, quite honestly, very similar to how certain Trojans can turn a PC into a bot, and similarly control it remotely."This is serious. The only thing you can do to prevent it is turn off your phone. Someone could pretty quickly take over every iPhone in the world with this."That's a bit of hyperbole, as first a hacker would have to know the appropriate phone numbers to use to hack an iPhone (and there are plenty of phone numbers assigned to other devices). It is obviously very serious, and despite the researchers sharing their results with Apple over a month ago, there has been no movement on a fix as of yet.Interestingly, the researchers also found a similar "remote control" texting bug in Windows Mobile, and other bugs in Android and the iPhone that can let hackers boot the phones off the network. The Android bug has been closed, but the second iPhone bug has not.Miller and Mulliner also found a hole in the iPhone's Safari browser way back in 2007 when it was first launched.Comment and add to the story without registration, but keep the comments meaningful please.

Citigroup Inc. said its free U.S. mobile-banking application for Apple Inc.'s iPhone contained a security flaw and advised its customers to upgrade to a newer version that corrects the problem.In an incident that highlights the growing security challenges around wireless apps, Citi said its iPhone app accidentally saved information—including account numbers, bill payments and security access codes—in a hidden file on users' iPhones. The information may also have been saved to a user's computer if it had been synched with an iPhone.The issue affected the approximately 117,600 customers who had registered the iPhone app with Citi since its launch in March 2009, a person familiar with the matter said. The bank doesn't believe any personal data was exposed by the flaw."We have no reason to believe that our customers' personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately by anyone," Citi said. Apple acknowledged the issue and encouraged users to download the updated app.Mobile banking is a popular and fast-growing activity on smartphones, as cellphones become more sophisticated and consumers use them to organize their lives. The Citi Mobile app, currently the 11th most-popular offering in the finance category of Apple's App Store, allows customers to check balances, transfer funds and pay bills.An estimated 18 million adults, or 7% of the adult population, are "active users" of mobile banking, meaning they use it at least once every three months—a small but growing fraction of the 196 million adults, or 84% of the population, who use any kind of banking services, said Red Gillen, a mobile- banking analyst at Celent, a financial-services research firm.Citibank, with an estimated 800,000 mobile customers, ranks No. 5 in mobile banking, Celent said, behind Bank of America Corp. at No. 1 with an estimated 5 million users. In between are J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. at No. 2 with 2 million, United Services Automobile Association at No. 3 with 1.5 million, and Wells Fargo & Co. with 1.4 million, according to Celent estimates.Experts worry that security isn't keeping up with the app boom. Among their concerns is the prospect of "leakage" any time a wireless app logs confidential data. The risk of flaws like Citi's, says John Hering, CEO of mobile security provider Lookout, is that a hacker could devise a malicious app to retrieve sensitive information stored on an iPhone.Citi said its mobile-banking app is the only application authorized to access the hidden data. The upgraded application, released July 19, doesn't store the information and deletes any account data that may have been saved to a user's iPhone or computer.Citi said the problem was discovered in a routine security review. The bank told customers of the problem in a letter dated July 20. Other Citi mobile apps such as the app for credit-card customers weren't affected, Citi said in a statement.Citi developed the application with mobile financial-services provider mFoundry . Drew Sievers, CEO of mFoundry, a private company based in Larkspur, Calif., said his company custom-wrote the mobile-banking part of the application and handed it over to Citibank, which then combined it with custom code of its own.Citi is responsible for distributing and managing the app, Mr. Sievers said. MFoundry, which provides mobile-banking software to 150 banks and credit unions besides Citi, said none of its other customers were affected by the problem.Citi said it performed security tests before and after releasing the application, but failed to detect the problem. The bank said it is looking into why it didn't find the vulnerability earlier.Mr. Hering, the CEO of Lookout, said his company is discovering more apps that could inadvertently expose or leak personal data, such as location information and phone numbers. "Most consumers and app developers don't know what is happening in their apps, because it is moving so fast," Mr. Hering said. "Apps are proliferating so quickly. We will see more and more of this."

An interesting NYT Bits blog entry covers Opera's mobile browser . Buried in the middle of the article is this quote: "Opera's engineers have developed a version of Opera Mini that can run on an Apple iPhone, but Apple won't let the company release it because it competes with Apple's own Safari browser." It also talks about Opera on the Wii and browsers in cars. A good read. : But back to the iPhone. As tempted as I am to just shrug it off, since Apple is free to run its App Store any way it pleases, as an enthusiastic iPhone user, I think Apple is shooting itself in the foot here, as it is with all the "competitive" apps being rejected. Apple does stand to lose some Google revenue by letting people use other browsers, but they have much more to gain by unleashing the creativity of the developer community and giving them the freedom to improve or replace core iPhone functionality. Hopefully competition from Android forces them to wake up.

Apple is planning to launch a new version of the iPhone which will work almost anywhere in the world, according to American technology experts.The "worldwide" version of the iPhone will be sold first in the US market next summer by Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone has a 45% stake, according to Ashok Kumar, analyst at Northeast Securities.The new phone will use a microchip developed by Qualcomm that can use both the 3G networks which predominate in Europe and Africa as well as the CDMA2000 network used by Verizon in the US and other networks across the world."This Qualcomm-powered world phone will facilitate Apple to be carrier-agnostic," Kumar said, meaning it would be able to further expand its list of mobile network partners.Kumar's prediction follows a recent report by industry analysts OTR Global which quoted sources in the Taiwan handset supply chain as saying they had been contracted to supply a "hybrid" iPhone by the third quarter of 2010.When Apple initially launched the iPhone in 2007 it did so under exclusive deals with network partners in the US, UK, France and Germany. Since then, however, it has abandoned this strategy in order to sell iPhones through many more mobile phone networks across the world.Earlier this week, Orange started selling the iPhone in the UK, ending O2's two-year long exclusive deal. Orange reckons that it had sold over 30,000 by 4pm on the first day of sales, while Carphone Warehouse believes it will sell a 1m iPhones by Christmas.The success of the iPhone has made Apple the world's most profitable smartphone manufacturer, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, overtaking the world's largest handset producer, Nokia.The research firm has examined the smartphone market for the three months to the end of September – in which 43m phones that can access the web, send emails and download applications were sold – and reckons that Apple surpassed Nokia for the first time ever."We estimate Apple's operating profit for its iPhone handset division stood at $1.6bn in the third quarter of 2009," said Alex Spektor, analyst at Strategy Analytics. "Apple overtook Nokia for the first time, which recorded a lower $1.1bn of operating profit. With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost controls, the PC vendor has successfully broken into the mobile phone market in just two years."Nokia has struggled to produce a lucrative rival to the iPhone. The Apple device has also spawned a host of touchscreen devices from other handset manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and Motorola, all of which have eaten into Nokia's share of a smartphone market it once dominated. Last month, Nokia announced its first quarterly loss for more than a decade.The slew of touchscreen phones that have hit the shops have helped the smartphone market outperform the rest of the mobile phone industry, where sales have been in decline. But Nokia does not seem able to capitalise on the fact that consumers want high-end devices and its share of the smartphone market is slipping.Last month, Nokia said it reckoned the entire mobile phone industry shipped 288m units in the quarter, down 7% on the same period a year ago, but up 7% on the second quarter. Nokia, however, shipped 108.5m units in the third quarter, which is down 8% on the same period last year and only up 5% on the previous quarter.Nokia stripped out smartphone sales from the overall figures, estimating that 47m "converged mobile devices" were shipped in the three months, compared with an estimated 44.2m units in the third quarter of 2008 and 41m units in the second quarter of 2009. Of that total figure, Nokia sold 16.4m units in the third quarter of 2009; that is down from 16.9m in the second quarter of 2009 but admittedly a better performance than the 15.5m it shipped in the third quarter of the previous year.Just a week after the results were announced, Nokia took the dramatic step of launching a legal attack on Apple in the US courts, alleging the iPhone infringes 10 of its patents in a dispute that could drag on for years.

Google launched its first-ever Gmail app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch on Wednesday, but was forced to yank it from Apple's App Store within minutes due to a bug, Computerworld reported."Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS. Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app," Matthew Izatt, a Google product manager, wrote on the company's Gmail blog. "We’ve removed the app while we correct the problem, and we’re working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who’s already installed the app can continue to use it."According to Computerworld, "scores" of users who downloaded the app were complaining on Twitter that they received a "Notification Error" message upon launching the app. "Googla culpa!" David Girouard, Google's vice president of apps, Tweeted on Wednesday, according to Computerworld. "Sorry, but we pushed a bad version of our iOS app for Gmail. More info shortly - we're working on it."Before the app was yanked, Izatt had written a blog post touting the new app and saying it was "fast, efficient and take[s] full advantage of the touchscreen and notification capabilities of your device."Meanwhile, Google has also been rolling out a new look for its regular Gmail service. On Tuesday, the company wrote a blog post giving an "in-depth" look at the new design, along with a video:On Wednesday, as people got a chance to experience the changes from themselves, many have, perhaps predictably, shared their feelings on Twitter.

It’s supposed to be your "life in your pocket," not Apple’s. But a piece of code discovered in the iPhone operating system might keep you under Apple’s control.Jonathan Zdrianski, author of the book iPhone Open Application Development, discovered a URL hidden in iPhone’s CoreLocation that he believes the iPhone uses to check whether any apps on your phone match with those listed in a database of blacklisted applications. Presumably, that would allow Apple to remotely de-authorize those apps, or perhaps even delete them."This suggests that the iPhone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off," Zdrianski wrote. "At the moment, no apps have been blacklisted, but by all appearances, this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for, if Apple so chooses to shut it down."Hum. So then all of those who got away with NetShare before it disappeared from the App Store aren’t so safe/lucky after all.Now, if Apple were more organized with regard to what appears and disappears from the App Store, they probably wouldn’t need this emergency procedure. What’s the point of an approval process if the useless, $1,000 "I Am Rich" app is going to make it out the door, only to be yanked immediately afterward?

Carrier IQ has been dominating the headlines ever since 25-year-old security researcher Trevor Eckhart posted a paper online saying Carrier IQ was secretly gathering data about users' cell phone activity on the behalf of cell phone companies Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile. The company insists it's not malicious, but that hasn't stopped several parties from suing it for allegedly violating federal wiretap laws.Carrier IQ isn't on every phone - and you can check if it's on yours with a free app from Lookout or BitDefender - but if you have detected it and want to remove it there are a couple options: 1. The easiest is to purchase Eckhart’s own removal app from the Android Market ($0.99), called Logging TestApp Pro Key. You need to root your phone first. And beware: several reviewers have warned that even after you buy the app, you need to donate money before it works. 2. The other way is to flash your Android smartphone with a custom ROM that doesn't contain Carrier IQ. The most popular is CyanogenMod, which gives you an option to opt out of data logging. "We at CyanogenMod would like everyone to know that if you are running our software, you are not running theirs," CM wrote in a blog post.Check out a video demo below from 'AbrahamsTech' of how to do this. As for iOS devices, you can really only block Carrier IQ. For those running iOS 5 and above, simply click into Settings/General/About/Diagnostics & Usage, and hit “Don’t Send.” If you're stuck on iOS 3 or 4, or have a jailbroken device, Chpwn’s instructions should do the trick. Apple told my colleague Chloe Albanesiusthat it stopped supporting Carrier IQ on most of its devices with iOS 5 and will remove it from all products in a future software update—most likely an incremental one rather than a full update like iOS 6.Although Carrier IQ says its software is intended to help its clients monitor network performance and it denies gathering any personal information from users like screen shots or the content of their text messages and emails, many people still loathe the idea of a company recording how they use their phones.For more from Sara, follow her on Twitter @sarapyin.

Many iPhone users arrived at work an hour late this morning after a glitch caused their smartphone's alarm to malfunction.In the latest clock woe to strike the Apple device, some phones rang their alert an hour late, while others were an hour early and many didn't ring at all.Users who missed appointments took to Twitter and other blogging sites to vent their frustration.One person who had an unexpected lie-in Tweeted: 'It was set for 8 but went off at 7 I then set it for 9 and it went off at 9'.The glitch is thought to have been caused by the change to British Summer Time in the early hours of Sunday morning.But for all of its fancy features, the iPhone has had trouble telling the time of late, particularly when the clocks go back or forward an hour.A clock malfunction prevented alarms from sounding for the first three days of the New Year, leading to complaints from users that they had missed flights or were late to arrive at work.The devices also struggled to adjust to the end of U.S. daylight savings time in November.One possible solution is to shut down and restart the phone or switch it to 'airplane mode' and then back again - advice that is too little, too late for those who slept in.Apple was embroiled in publicity problems in July last year after the launch of the iPhone 4, when reports about bad reception snowballed and forced the company to call a news conference to address the issue, dubbed 'antennagate'.This had no visible impact on Apple's sales as the company sold more than 14million iPhones in the quarter ending last September, more than ever before.Apple reached another milestone earlier this month when it sold between 500,000 and a million iPad 2 tablet computers in the U.S. alone.People across America queued for hours to become one of the first to buy the must-have gadget.The pattern was repeated in the UK on Friday when the iPad 2 went on sale here. It was sold out by lunchtime on Saturday.

HTC has filed a law suit against Apple seeking a ban on imports of Asian-manufactured iPhones, iPods and iPads into the United States.The HTC caction alleges that Apple products infringed five HTC patents and seeks to have them barred from sale in the United States from their manufacturing facilities in Asia. Apple declined to comment."We are taking this action against Apple to protect our intellectual property, our industry partners, and most importantly our customers that use HTC phones," HTC vice president for North America Jason Mackenzie said."HTC believes the industry should be driven by healthy competition and innovation that offer consumers the best, most accessible mobile experiences possible," Mackenzie said in a statement.HTC, which stands for High Tech Computer, is Taiwan's leading smartphone maker. It is already the target of a patent suit by Apple filed in March alleging infringement of 20 iPhone patents including "user interface, underlying architecture and hardware". Apple too wants a ban on sales of HTC devices in the dispute.HTC makes handsets for a number of leading US companies and is the manufacturer of the Nexus One unveiled by Apple rival Google in January. It also makes other Android-based phones, including the Desire, sold in Australia, which some believe is a potential iPhone killer.While Apple's lawsuit against HTC did not name Google as a defendant, it was seen as a strategic move against Google, whose free mobile software also powers handsets from Samsung Electronics, Motorola and others.HTC's complaints re unlikely to block sales of Apple products any time soon. Patent disputes are common among technology companies and often take years to resolve. The cases often lead to licensing agreements rather than outright bans on imports.The wild success of the first iPhone, which launched in 2007, prompted other mobile phone phone makers to rush out touch-screen smart phones of their own in a bid to lure consumers, not just business users attached to their BlackBerry phones.At the end of 2009, iPhones made up about 14 per cent of smart phones sold worldwide, according to the research group Gartner. Apple inched closer to BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, which had 20 per cent of sales. But Android phones, while accounting for only four per cent of sales, grew at a faster rate than Apple last year.Apple is also being sued by Nokia for patent infringement. It has fired a countersuit against the Finnish mobile phone giant.Canada's Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, has also had its share of patent woes and was accused of patent infringement by US mobile phone maker Motorola in a suit filed in January.

A US hacker who gained notoriety for unlocking Apple's iPhone as a teenager has told BBC News that he has now hacked Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3). George Hotz said the hack, which could allow people to run pirated games or homemade software, took him five weeks. He said he was still refining the technique but intended to post full details online soon. The PS3 is the only games console that has not been hacked, despite being on the market for three years. "It's supposed to be unhackable - but nothing is unhackable," Mr Hotz told BBC News. "I can now do whatever I want with the system. It's like I've got an awesome new power - I'm just not sure how to wield it." Sony said it was "investigating the report" and would "clarify the situation" when it had more information. Mr Hotz said that he had begun the hack last summer when he had spent three weeks analysing the hardware. After a long break, he spent a further two weeks cracking the console, which he described as a "very secure system". He said that he was not yet ready to reveal the full details of the hack but said that it was "5% hardware and 95% software". The hack could allow gamers to play pirated games "You can use hardware to inject an insecurity and then you can build on that," he said. He admitted that he had not managed to hack the whole system, including the protected memory, but had worked out ways to trick the console into doing what he wanted. Mr Hotz said that he was continuing to work on the hack and, once finished, would publish details online in a similar way to his previous iPhone exploits. In particular, he said, he would publish details of the console's "root key", a master code that once known would make it easier for others to decipher and hack other security features on the console. He said his motivation was "curiosity" and "opening up the platform". "To tell you the truth, I've never really played a PS3," he said. "I have one game, but I've never really played it." Opening the system could allow people to install other operating systems on their console and play homemade games, he said. In addition, he said, the hack would allow people to play older PS2 games on their consoles. Recent versions of the PS3 do not have the ability to play PS2 games after Sony controversially removed a piece of hardware. He admitted that it could also allow people to run pirated games. "I'm not going to personally have anything to do with that," he told BBC News. Gaming firms do not take the issue of game piracy and console modification lightly. Recently, Microsoft disconnected thousands of gamers from its online gaming service Xbox Live for modifying their consoles to play pirated games. Mr Hotz said that the nature of his PS3 hack means that Sony may have difficulty patching the exploit. "We are investigating the report and will clarify the situation once we have more information," said a Sony spokesman. Mr Hotz rose to fame in 2007 at the age of 17 when he unlocked the iPhone, which could only be used on the AT&T network in the US at launch. The hack allowed the popular handset to be used on any network. He has since released various other hacks, allowing people to unlock later versions of the popular handset.

Path has released a new version of the app which asks for permission before it sends your address book to its servers and has blogged about the episode.Dave Morin, the CEO of Path has responded in the comments and I’ve pasted it below. As an aside – never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this to blow up like this. I hope we can keep calm and continue to discuss this sensibly.Arun, thanks for pointing this out. We actually think this is an important conversation and take this very seriously. We upload the address book to our servers in order to help the user find and connect to their friends and family on Path quickly and effeciently as well as to notify them when friends and family join Path. Nothing more. We believe that this type of friend finding & matching is important to the industry and that it is important that users clearly understand it, so we proactively rolled out an opt-in for this on our Android client a few weeks ago and are rolling out the opt-in for this in 2.0.6 of our iOS Client, pending App Store approval.It all started innocently enough. I was thinking of implementing a Path Mac OS X app as part of our regularly scheduled hackathon. Using the awesome mitmproxy tool which was featured on the front page of Hacker News yesterday, I started to observe the various API calls made to Path’s servers from the iPhone app. It all seemed harmless enough until I observed a request to .Upon inspecting closer, I noticed that my entire address book (including full names, emails and phone numbers) was being sent as a plist to Path. Now I don’t remember having given permission to Path to access my address book and send its contents to its servers, so I created a completely new “Path” and repeated the experiment and I got the same result – my address book was in Path’s hands.Disclaimer: I’m not insinuating that Path is doing something nefarious with my address book but I feel quite violated that my address book is being held remotely on a third-party service. I love Path as an iOS app and I think there are some brilliant people working on it, but this seems a little creepy. I wonder how many other iOS apps actually do the same…As soon as you create a new account to Path, a call is made to with your first name, last name, gender and password. An plist is returned which contains the user’s ID as well as other information such as the date of creation.This API call uses basic HTTP authentication (with a certain key) to obtain some metadata about myself – from the binary plist file it looks like it contains my first name, last name, cover photo, profile picture, etc.This is the actual offending call which uploads my entire address book to Path.This is followed by normal API calls which among others, updates my location, fetches my activity stream and tracks events within the app using Mixpanel.This has been tried out on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.

For many iPhone 4 and 4S owners, iOS 6 has been a mixed blessing. The features are terrific, but many users are reporting huge amounts of battery drainage that never was the case before the system upgrade.As an iPhone 4S owner, I can tell you from first hand knowledge that my iPhone loses about ten percent of its charge per hour without doing anything but sitting in my pocket. I noticed that with the lock screen set to two minutes, and the screen turned off, the iPhone feels quite warm, as if it's doing something.Many have blamed this on the Maps app, but I haven't even run the Maps app, so for me, that isn't the problem.An Apple Discussion board thread has more than 200 entries discussing this problem and some solutions that may provide a fix in rare cases, but it is no panacea for the great majority of users.Here are a few comments from the Apple Support Boards:Only1jb: "Used my 4S the same as every other work day. Usually come home with about 60 percent. Came home today with 17 percent."John Smith 1882: "100 percent at 8am this morning when I took it off the charger. 0 percent within four hours. No calls. No GPS, no Internet use, but battery was dropping one percent every few minutes. I turned off location services, no change."LocalBus: "Thinking of switching back to 5.1.1 now!! 9am to 10:30am the battery drain is 100 percent to 52 percent!!!!! Something is very wrong."There are scores of other  complaints.Suggestions have been offered, such as turning off location services, Maps, Passbook etc. Nothing seems to work for more than one person.The problem is not limited to those on the Support Discussion. This problem is not just being reported on the Support Site. On MacRumors forums, a user with the handle of DArsenault reported that "Battery life on the 4 is terrible. Since I've upgraded my phone drains rapidly when it's not even in use. My phone dropped from 63 percent to 30 percent in about an hour of just sitting on my desk unused."Others have reported no excessive battery drain, but enough have to make this a salient issue that needs to be addressed and quickly. I've gotten used to carrying my two battery back-up cases to just get through the day.We'll keep you posted as more information becomes available, but it seems like a software fix is in order.

After initially denying that the San Francisco Police Department was involved in searching the house of a man suspected of possessing a lost iPhone 5 prototype, a spokesman for the department has confirmed that plainclothes officers visited, but did not enter, the residence with Apple security officials.The back-and-forth saga over an iPhone 5 prototype that was reportedly lost in a bar in July took on new twists after the San Francisco Police Department first denied, then confirmed, its involvement in the search for the device. SFPD spokesman Lt. Troy Dangerfeld told SF Weekly on Friday that "three or four" officers accompanied two Apple security officials to a home in the Bernal Heights neighborhood of the city. Though a separate spokesperson had originally been unable to find a record of the investigation, Dangerfeld confirmed the visit to 22-year-old Sergio Calderón's house after speaking with Apple and the captain of the Ingleside police station. The police officers "did not go inside the house," instead standing outside while Apple's employees searched Calderón's house, car and computer. "Apple came to us saying that they were looking for a lost item, and some plainclothes officers responded out to the house with them," Dangerfield said. "My understanding is that they stood outside...They just assisted Apple to the address." For his part, Calderón claims that he was led to believe that all of the visitors were police officers, as none of them identified themselves as working for Apple. "When they came to my house, they said they were SFPD," he said. "I thought they were SFPD. That's why I let them in." Calderón also alleged he was threatened by the police during the visit. "One of the officers is like, 'Is everyone in this house an American citizen?' They said we were all going to get into trouble," he said. But, Dangerfeld said that there did not appear to be any evidence that Apple's security team had falsely represented themselves as police officers. "I don't have any indication of that. I'm not going to go there," he said, adding that he plans to speak with Calderón about the incident. Details of the missing iPhone prototype first emerged earlier this week . Apple reportedly scrambled to recover the device once it discovered it was missing, using GPS to track the prototype from the Cava22 bar (pictured below) in the Mission to Bernal Heights. The incident contains an eery resemblance to last year's drama over an iPhone 4 prototype, which was left in a bar in Redwood City and eventually sold to a publication. Police have charged two individuals with misappropriation of lost property and possession of stolen property. However, Gawker Media, which reportedly paid $5000 to obtain the device, will not face charges.

Well, well, would you looky here? Seems like that super-exclusive iPhone leak that Gizmodo and Engadget were involved in has repeated itself in Vietnam.Engadget reported earlier this morning about the leak, and noticed that the phone is slightly different from the one seen during Gizgate, in that the screws on the bottom of the phone are no longer present.Aside from that, there are few other differences. The model is still pre-production — you can see little XXX placeholders on the body — so it may still change before launch, but the front-facing camera looks to be a pretty sure thing.Pro tip: the source link has some awesome commentary on the leak, courtesy of Google Translate. It also has more photos.

Someone on AT&T's product marketing team must be trigger happy as the company once again mistakenly publishes a notice about free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users.AT&T iPhone users will not be getting free Wi-Fi access after all.For the second time in less than six months, AT&T mistakenly published a notice on its Web site indicating that Apple iPhone users would get free access to the wireless operator's more than 17,000 Wi-Fi hot spots around the country.News of free access to AT&T Wi-Fi hot spots was reported on several blogs Friday morning after it was discovered that a notice had been posted on AT&T's Web site. The notice, which was still live at 8:30 a.m. PDT but then was removed by 9:30 a.m., said:"AT&T knows Wi-Fi is hot, and free Wi-Fi even hotter, which is why we are proud to offer iPhone customers free access to the nation's largest Wi-Fi hot-spot network with more than 17,000 hot spots, including Starbucks. Now users can relax and access music, e-mail, and Web browsing services with their favorite blend in hand from the comfort of their favorite location."But Wes Warnock, an AT&T spokesman, told CNET News that the notice was published in error."We have not made any announcement regarding free Wi-Fi and iPhone," he said in an e-mail. "The Web page was posted in error and is being removed."The same thing happened in May when AT&T first launched free Wi-Fi access to its Laptop Connect customers, who subscribe to the company's 3G data service for laptops. Then, like now, a notice had been published briefly on AT&T's Web site indicating free Wi-Fi access for iPhone users. It was promptly removed. And at the time, a company representative told The New York Times that the notice had been published in error.I asked Warnock why AT&T had inadvertently published this information not once, but twice, and he had no comment. An AT&T spokesman had told me when the Laptop Connect program launched that smartphones, including the iPhone, would be added to the list of free of Wi-Fi access later in the year. But when I asked Warnock to verify this information, he again declined to comment.It's frustrating enough as it is sifting through the barrage of iPhone rumors and misinformation on the Web. But to have misinformation disseminated by AT&T's official Web site is even more disconcerting. I'd love to hear what readers have to say on this matter. I can't imagine it's winning AT&T any points among customers or potential customers in terms of customer service.

The highly anticipated iPhone 5 may already be facing competition in China -- and it hasn't even been released to the public yet.Recently founded GooPhone unveiled its phone in late August, according to GizChina, and it looks an awful lot like the leaked images of the iPhone 5 that have been circulating around the Web.The GooPhone I5 runs on an Android platform, and may have a 3.5-inch display instead of the 4-inch display rumored to be a feature of the iPhone 5. Otherwise, the two smartphones seem pretty identical.Raw Story reports the GooPhone will include a quad-core 1.4Ghz processor, 8 mega-pixel camera, high-def screen and desktop theme mimicking the iPhone’s iconic aesthetic. The clone also features a honeybee logo on its back panel and boasts a markedly cheaper price: $300 dollars, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.If this cloned phone is the real deal, Apple may have bigger problems than a Chinese price war.According to Gizmodo, GooPhone, the smartphone business of Shenzhen Shenma Lianzhong e-Commerce, is planning on suing Apple if it tries to release its iPhone 5, citing patent violations.Plausible?Perhaps in China, writes Robin Feldman, Professor of Law at UC Hastings and author of the book "Rethinking Patent Rights."“It would be unfortunate if a country’s patent system were designed to allow this type of behavior," Feldman told Wired.“If this behavior had occurred in the United States, Apple would have an action for misappropriation of trade secrets.”In a report released Thursday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, the trade organization warns of the dangers of "trademark squatting."This not the first time GooPhone has attempted to beat mainstream manufacturers to the punch. According to Wired, the Hong-Kong based company has produced knockoffs of the Samsung Galaxy S3, the HTC ONE S and the iPhone 4. In the case of the Galaxy S3, the advertisements used by GooPhone appear to be press shots of the original product.Copied products in Asia are edging into a very lucrative market. China has recently overtaken the U.S. in overall smartphone sales, according to the latest research from the International Data Corporation. In 2012, China will account for 26.5 percent of all smartphone shipments, up from 18.3 percent in 2011 and nearly nine percentage points higher than U.S. smartphones shipments.The other major issue presented by the GooPhone I5 and its ilk are the lawsuits that will surely follow.Apple is currently embroiled in several disputes in China, over the iPad trademark, Siri technology and the Snow Leopard operating system.

Samsung is suing Apple to stop sales of the iPhone 4S in Australia, just days after the device went on sale around the world.Both companies are now shelling out millions in legal fees to fight more than 20 patent infringement cases in 10 countries. Samsung recently vowed to shift its strategy from "passive" to being "more aggressive" in targeting Apple for "free riding" on its patents.Samsung filed a suit seeking a ban on sales of the iPhone 4S in the Federal Court's New South Wales Registry today, and separately lodged an appeal against last week's decision by the court to temporarily ban sales of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia.Suits against the iPhone 4S had already been launched in Italy and France but today Samsung filed preliminary injunction motions in Tokyo and Australia. A similar case in the Netherlands was dismissed on Friday.It is unclear why Samsung did not file its suit before the device went on sale. Telstra alone has sold tens of thousands of iPhone 4 units in the opening three days - "our highest-selling iPhone launch to date" - according to Telstra's director of mobile, Andrew Volard.Senior patent lawyer Mark Summerfield, from Watermark in Melbourne, said he believed the delay in filing the suit would make it much harder for Samsung to make a case for pulling the iPhone 4S from shelves. He said Samsung may have been waiting for the Federal Court to hand down its preliminary injunction decision for the Galaxy Tab 10.1, which occurred last Thursday."I don't think the chances are very high that it will actually be pulled off the shelves," Summerfield said, adding he believed any resolution would most likely be around the payment of royalties.Independent intellectual property expert Florian Mueller said he did not believe Samsung would be successful in its bid to block the iPhone 4S as the patents it was relying on were "essential to the 3G telecommunications standard".Samsung recently surpassed Apple in global smartphone sales for the third quarter."Samsung's preliminary injunction request in Australia cites three patent infringements related to wireless telecommunications standards, specifically Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) and HSPA," Samsung said in a statement."The injunction request in Japan cites infringements on one High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) standard-related patent and three user interface patents, which seriously violate Samsung's intellectual property."In light of these violations, Samsung believes the sale of such Apple devices should be injuncted. Apple has continued to violate our patent rights and free ride on our technology. We will steadfastly protect our intellectual property."Earlier today it was revealed that despite the injunction on the Galaxy Tab 10.1, many Australians were still ordering the device from online stores.Samsung has suffered setbacks in court in recent days. In addition to the temporary ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 sales in Australia, in the US a judge said Samsung infringed Apple's iPad patents while in the Netherlands a court dismissed Samsung's request to block sales of the iPhone and iPad in that country.Peter Black, an intellectual property law lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, said it was important to note the difference between an interim injunction and a final injunction. Last week's ban on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia was an interim injunction until the court can make a final decision on the patent infringement case, which is due next year."It is easier to obtain an interim injunction than a final injunction," he said. This was because an interim injunction only required that a court be satisfied that the applicant has a prima facie case, meaning that it is more probable than not that it will succeed at trial.He questioned whether the patent system in Australia was actually promoting innovation in software and mobile technologies, or whether the patent system and these endless lawsuits were "in fact stifling competition and innovation, with the customer being the ultimate loser".In seeking to block the sale of the iPhone 4S in Australia, Samsung is relying on the following patents: This reporter is on Twitter: @ashermoses

This is quickly becoming somewhat of a routine event after Apple’s latest iPhone goes on sale: A number of early adopters are having issues with the screens on their new phones. When the iPhone 4 first launched two years ago, quite a few users got devices that had odd yellow spots in some areas, for example. This time around, the issues are a bit more mysterious. Some iPhone 5s, for example, show an odd bubble effect when their users press the screen too hard. Others report that their screens are flickering and are blurry in some areas.It’s not clear how widespread these issues are, but a number of videos that demonstrate these problems have now popped up on YouTube (via Arnold Kim).Here is an example of the odd bubble effect:This user recorded how his phone’s screen flickers for no apparent reason:And here is another example of the bubble effect:On the MacRumors forum, some users also complain about some backlight bleeding issues and on Apple’s own forum, at least one user complained about the fact that the lower part of his screen is blurry and another reported that his phone shows “a wavy line at the bottom and the top of the screen that is slightly discolored.”We will keep tracking this, but let us know if you are having similar issues with your new iPhone 5.

I woke up this morning overcome with anticipation, just like the 599,999 other people who pre-ordered the iPhone 4. I pre-ordered my phone through Best Buy, and it proved to be a simple and easy process. Obvious "foreshadowing" alert.Unlike Apple, Best Buy didn't have any lines wrapping around their store, having staggered their iPhone pickups to lessen the load on their employees. I had my phone for about two hours prior to everyone else in the office—two extra hours of blissful "Haha's!," until everyone else finally picked their own up. I fell in love with this phone immediately. The hardware is unparalleled, it is beautifully designed and the glass back really does look stunning (when it's not shattered), and iOS4 runs like a dream with the new processor.I volunteered to test the phone all day, doing reception tests, processor tests, and just about anything else to put phone into numbers on paper. Not only did I volunteer because I had the fortune of picking my phone up before everyone else, but also because by doing these tests I got to play with my new toy all day (as opposed to playing with my new toy all day and being reprimanded for doing no work because I was playing with my new phone all day.)The final test I performed was to see how well the reception held up while traveling by car. I took a cab from the Giz office in Soho up to Times Square, testing the call quality and comparing it to the 3GS. I got out in Times Square, and everyone was flabbergasted that the AT&T network didn't drop either call for over a half an hour.Everything was great in my little world—I was in Times Square with my shiny new iPhone 4. And then the inevitable happened—or what, I imagine, we'll come to think of as the inevitable. I tried to do the little trick where you hold the iPhone 4 just with your left hand and all your bars drop away until you have no service. Note to readers: Don't do this in a crowded intersection during rush hour. I felt my phone slip from my awkwardly positioned fingers—it hung for a moment at the end of my ear bud cord, like a bungee jumper moments before his cord snaps—and then I painfully watched as it tumbled over the curb in a sudden whirl of annihilation. The back glass panel shattered, and so did my heart. OK, that may be a little melodramatic…but I am really upset.It wasn't even that epic of a fall. It hit the curb on its side, didn't really bounce and then sort of flopped over onto its back, facing up. The side that made the initial impact didn't have a scratch on it—funny how that works with steel, right? But with the combination of the force of the phone hitting the ground from about three feet up and the fact that it crashed onto an uneven surface (street curb), it never had a chance. From the terrible shrill it made, I knew it was broken before I even picked it up. It's nothing spectacular dropping and breaking this phone. If anything, a compelling display of destruction would have been a redeeming quality.I shattered my phone hours after buying it, in the line of duty no less. If only Apple decided to make the back of the phone steel. Or rubber. Or leather. Or not fucking glass, the most shatterable material known to man. But hey, I'm trying to think optimistically here; at least it wasn't the front screen that cracked, and the look gives it character... I guess.

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

According to Bloomberg, Google’s Motorola unit just filed a new patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington. According to this report, Motorola’s complaint seeks to block Apple from importing the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and “various Apple computers.” Today’s lawsuit is only the latest in a long series of recent disputes between Apple and Motorola/Google, but it marks the first time that Motorola is filing one of these lawsuits since its acquisition by Google became final in February.It’s not currently clear what exactly the patents are that Google is trying to defend with this new lawsuit, but we reached out to Motorola and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the company did indeed file a complaint with the ITC today.We are still waiting to get more details and will update the post once we hear more, but based on what we’ve heard so far, the complaint will focus on technologies Apple uses in virtually all of its current hardware products. The full complaint, Motorola tells us, won’t be available on the ITC’s website until Monday.Until then, here is Motorola’s official statement regarding this complaint:It’s worth noting that, as FOSS Patent’s Florian Mueller notes, an ITC judge already issued a preliminary ruling in a previous Motorola vs. Apple case and argued that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola’s patents. The ruling for that case is expected to come down next week. This was a standard-essential patent, though, making an import ban based on the upcoming ruling in this previous case unlikely. Mueller also notes that if Motorola won a ban in this case, this wouldn’t affect the iPhone 4S and new iPad 4G, as these use a Qualcomm chipset that falls outside of Motorola’s patent claims.Given that we don’t know enough about today’s lawsuit, it’s currently impossible to say if Motorola’s attempt to ban Apple’s imports based on the new lawsuit will have more teeth.

AT&T is making an attempt to quietly settle with the iPhone user who was recently awarded $850 in a lawsuit over AT&T's data-throttling practices, but the user in question doesn't want any part of it. Instead, he's committed to fighting AT&T and hopes other subscribers follow his example by taking AT&T to court over the throttling of supposed "unlimited" data plans, and has taken his cause to a website called PublikDemand to get others involved.Matthew Spaccarelli won an $850 judgement against AT&T in a California small-claims court in late February when the court found that it wasn't fair for AT&T to slow down data speeds under his iPhone's unlimited data plan. Spaccarelli had argued that he was being throttled after using 1.5GB to 2GB of data in one billing cycle—well within the 3GB tiered plan AT&T currently offers to customers for the same price ($30 per month) as the now-defunct unlimited plan.When AT&T phased out the unlimited plan, however, the carrier allowed existing subscribers to be grandfathered in and continue using it. But Spaccarelli wasn't just downloading 1.5 to 2GB of data on his iPhone—he was using his phone to share the data access with his iPad without paying the extra fee required by AT&T for tethering/hotspot service. This was a violation of AT&T's terms of service, causing the carrier to switch his plan to a limited one. Spaccarelli complained, however, and had it changed back to an unlimited plan.Now, according to the Associated Press, AT&T has sent a letter to Spaccarelli demanding that he participate in settlement talks or his phone service may be shut down. Spaccarelli posted the documents online—something AT&T's letter specifically asks him not to do—in hopes that his case emboldens others like him to follow suit.  "Looks like #att is threatening to cut off my service if I don't sign a confidentiality agreement to talk about settling. I thought I won!!" Spaccarelli posted to Twitter on Tuesday. In another tweet, he directed users to PublikDemand "to get help with small claims court against AT&T."Correction: AT&T reached out to us for clarification, saying that the letter says if he chose to engage in settlement talks, there would be a standard mutual NDA. Spaccarelli's service would only be terminated if he agreed to the settlement but violated the signed agreement.

The iPhone 4 may be available to the general public, but the police investigation into the leaked device that Gizmodo purchased last spring is still going strong. Now there’s been a new development: the EFF reports that the San Mateo District Attorney has withdrawn the warrant it used to search Gizmodo editor Jason Chen’s house last April, when it confiscated multiple computers, hard drives, and other electronics.Update: The Wall Street Journal reports that Gawker has reached an agreement with investigators. Chen’s materials will be returned, and Gawker/Chen will be voluntarily handing over materials deemed “relevant to the case” by a court appointee.The seizure of these possessions was quite controversial — the EFF said it was illegal and should have been protected by California’s Shield Law. When I called the District Attorney about the case in April, I was told that the investigation was on hold as these issues were considered, and that Chen’s property was sitting in a warehouse untouched. It’s apparently been sitting there for months. At the time, I noted how bizarre the series of events were:When I asked if it was typical for the DA to evaluate the relevance of these shield laws after removing evidence, Wagstaffe did concede that it was unusual. Which makes the situation extremely od d— it should have been readily apparent that Gawker would defend its actions using this shield law defense, why put the brakes on after the fact?However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Chen is in the clear. The EFF says that police could “attempt to subpoena the same material without running afoul of section 1524(g) and still proceed with their case.”

Google's brand-new Android developer advocate, Tim Bray, wasn't afraid to start his first day on the company's payroll by taking some shots at a rival. "A sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers" were the words he used to describe Apple's iPhone platform. Bray was most recently employed at Sun Microsystems and is a longtime open source advocate.Sun Microsystems' loss was Google's gain on Monday, as former Sun guru Tim Bray announced that he's joined Google's Android push in the role of Developer Advocate."Google and I have been a plausible match for a long time," Bray wrote in a blog post announcing the decision. "Web-centric, check. Search, check. Open-source, check. The list goes on."Still, "the reason I'm here is mostly Android," he added, calling the platform "about as unambiguously a good thing as the tangled wrinkly human texture of the Net can sustain just now."Bray resigned in late February from his position as director of Web technologies at Sun and declined an offer from Oracle in the meantime, he said. He will work remotely for Google from his current Vancouver, B.C., location.A longtime open source advocate, Bray's background includes cofounding the Open Text Corporation as well as launching Canadian business analytics firm Antarctica Systems.He also worked on XML for the World Wide Web Consortium.Bray has written numerous software applications, including Unix file system benchmarking tool Bonnie, XML processor Lark and APE -- the Atom Protocol Exerciser.In his new role at Google, Bray didn't waste time before firing a few shots at Apple.The iPhone platform is "a sterile Disney-fied walled garden surrounded by sharp-toothed lawyers," Bray wrote. "The people who create the apps serve at the landlord's pleasure and fear his anger. I hate it."The iPhone's hardware and software may be great, but "freedom's not just another word for anything, nor is it an optional ingredient," he explained."Apple apparently thinks you can have the benefits of the Internet while at the same time controlling what programs can be run and what parts of the stack can be accessed and what developers can say to each other," he added. "I think they're wrong and see this job as a chance to help prove it."Bray also admitted he still has much to learn about the platform: "Are you an Android developer? Or might you become one? Or have you given up on Android? If you're any of these, you're a person I need to learn from," he said."Bray's addition to Google generally and to Android specifically is a win for both," RedMonk analyst Stephen O'Grady told LinuxInsider. "Tim's intimately familiar with the Java ecosystem and, better, what it's done right and what it's done wrong. For that alone, his hiring would be worth it."Even more important, however, is Bray's open-mindedness, O'Grady said."He has never been a Java bigot; he was a staunch advocate for dynamic languages and the REST architectural style during his tenure at Sun," O'Grady explained. "Whether that experience will manifest itself directly within the Android project is unclear, but he'll certainly look to keep the ecosystem as open as possible."In short, "Google just gained themselves a widely respected and pragmatic developer advocate," he concluded.Indeed, "it is a shrewd move to bring Tim Bray in as a figurehead for Android development," 451 group analyst Jay Lyman agreed. "As he's already demonstrated with some of his comments about the competition, he's not afraid to speak his mind nor to challenge others, whether he is competing or collaborating with them."Lyman recently wrote a like-minded blog post about Apple and the opportunity it's created by keeping its platform closed.While such assets have a potential to "contribute to further fragmentation for Android," they should serve him well in his new role, Lyman predicted."His technical and software development accomplishment and background combined with his outgoing nature should make him a good match for head Android wrangler," Lyman told LinuxInsider.

After successful attacks on Safari and Internet Explorer 8 on Wednesday, the second day of Pwn2Own saw the iPhone 4 and then the BlackBerry Torch 9800 successfully exploited. The annual security competition allows researchers to win any systems that they successfully compromise, and also awards them cash rewards if those security flaws are still present in the latest version of the software.The iPhone was hacked by Pwn2Own veteran Charlie Miller working with Dion Blazakis. In the last three years, Miller has successfully pwned both Apple's phones and laptops at the competition, and he kept his winning streak going this year with a successful attack on the iPhone 4. The flaw used to pwn the iPhone was in its Mobile Safari Web browser; the phone was compromised simply by visiting a specially-crafted Web page, which allowed Miller to run exploit code that allowed him to access the phone's address book.Past Pwn2Own competitions have required the contestants to test against the latest version of the software under attack, even if released on the day of the competition. This year, the software was frozen last week, preventing the use of last-minute patches to avoid exploitation. Successful exploits of the week-old configuration win the hardware, and if the exploit still exists in the latest software, money is also paid out for the flaw.The iPhone was running iOS 4.2.1, as its software was frozen prior to this week's release of iOS 4.3. However, Miller was awarded both the hardware and the money: the same security flaw is found in the newest version of Apple's operating system. Demonstrating the significance of the rule changes, however, was the fact that his exploit no longer worked. iOS 4.3 introduces Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and his exploit code did not take measures to defeat this operating system protection.The next platform to be tested was BlackBerry OS running on a BlackBerry Torch 9800, and this was duly cracked by a team made up of Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and Ralf Philipp Weinmann. Iozzo and Weinmann are also Pwn2Own veterans, pwning the iPhone in 2010. The BlackBerry OS attack exploited a flaw in the operating system's new WebKit-based browser. As with the other hacks demonstrated at the competition, merely visiting a specially-crafted Web page was sufficient to compromise the device.The trio of researchers said that attack was difficult to pull off, not because of operating system protections like Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and ASLR—BlackBerryOS 6 lacks both—but because the system is essentially a black box, with no public documentation about its internals, few useful software tools, and little known about its workings. Even after finding the initial security flaw, converting this into a useful exploit was difficult. In the event, they had to chain together three separate flaws to achieve a successful compromise, using information garnered from two information disclosure issues in conjunction with a third integer overflow flaw to run their exploit code.WebKit, in contrast to BlackBerry OS, is open source and widely studied as a result of its use in both Chrome and Safari: in moving to the modern browser, RIM has arguably made its platform more approachable to hackers and researchers alike. Were it not for this obscurity, the lack of DEP, ASLR, and code signing would leave it easy to attack, with Iozzo describing it as "way behind the iPhone at the moment, from a security perspective."The attack was demonstrated on BlackBerry OS 6.0.0.246. RIM has shipped a newer firmware since, but Pinckaers has confirmed that the flaw still exists.Also due to be tested on Thursday were Firefox, and phones running Android and Windows Phone 7. However, Firefox contestant Sam Thomas withdrew as he felt his exploit wasn't stable, and the competitors on the other platforms failed to turn up. This means that those platforms, in addition to Chrome (which also had its attacker withdraw), are so far undefeated. There is a possibility that this may change on Friday, the final day of the competition.

Who is she? Chinese netizens are hunting the iPhone girl.China's "human flesh search engine" is in hot pursuit of an unnamed Chinese factory worker after photographs of her showed up unexpectedly on a new iPhone 3G purchased recently in Britain.In one of the photos, a young woman dressed in a pink striped factory uniform and wearing a matching white cap and rubber gloves, is seen smiling and flashing a "V" sign as she leans over an iPhone assembly line.The photos were discovered by an iPhone user in Britain who promptly posted his find on the MacRumors forum, setting off a global chain reaction of media interest and culminating in the quest by Chinese internet users to discover her identity.The term "human flesh search engine" refers to this type of mob reaction by China's so-called netizens (internet citizens) to pool their collective resources in order to track someone down.In China, Apple uses the giant Taiwanese company FoxConn to assemble its iPods and iPhones. The company's main factories are based in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen, the booming city next door to Hong Kong.FoxConn representatives have confirmed to several Chinese newspapers that the woman - dubbed the "iPhone girl" - is an employee of the company.The spokesman said workers had most probably been testing the phone's camera and had forgotten to delete the photos. He said those involved would not be fired for the mistake."Small mistakes are unavoidable," the news agency AFP quoted FoxConn spokesman Liu Kun as saying. "I would call this a beautiful mistake."He said the factory worker in the photos was "quite nervous" after her face appeared on websites and in newspapers.FoxConn, which employs over 270,000 people in its Shenzhen factories, has said it will not be revealing the woman's identity.But Chinese journalists and bloggers have already narrowed the search down to the quality control section on the fifth floor of one of the FoxConn factory buildings - where up to 1000 employees reportedly work.Of the six photos in the set found on the iPhone, two are of the "iPhone girl" and four are of the factory in which the phones are assembled.The images have since been plastered all over the Chinese internet and as of the time of writing, there were over 20 million searches for the term "iPhone girl" recorded on Google's Chinese search site, google.cn.In addition, the domain names iphonegirl.net and iphonegirl.cn have been snapped up by web users trying to cash in on the sudden surge of interest.In 2006, Apple conducted an investigation into the work practises of FoxConn after reports emerged of sub-standard working conditions.Apple found there were some instances of overcrowding in worker dormitories and some evidence of over-working and harsh treatment - all oversights FoxConn agreed to rectify.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs hated the Android smartphone operating system so much that he vowed he would spend his last dying breath and every penny Apple had in the bank trying to destroy it. Android, created by Google, entered the market after Apple but soon gained greater market share. A lot of Apple fans dismiss Android as a ripoff of Apple’s ideas, and a crappy one at that.But oddly enough, Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Jobs in 1976, says he’s a big fan of Android phones. Woz says he still thinks Apple’s iPhone is the best overall smartphone, but he says there are ways in which Android has leapt ahead of Apple.Android phones aren’t as simple to use as the iPhone, but they’re not that much more complicated, and “if you’re willing to do the work to understand it a little bit, well I hate to say it, but there’s more available in some ways,” Woz says.There’s a theory that Android could do to iOS (Apple’s mobile operating system) what Microsoft Windows did to the Macintosh in the 1990s. Microsoft triumphed because it licensed its software to many different hardware makers and ultimately had much greater market share than Apple, which would only sell its operating system on its own hardware.In the mobile space, Apple is using the same playbook, tying its software tightly to its own hardware. And with Android, Apple is facing the same kind of foe that it once faced in Windows. “I can see the similarity,” Woz says.Worse yet, this time, he says, Apple is up against a stronger competitor, since in his mind Windows was never a very good program, while Android actually is. “There’s not as big a difference [between iOS and Android] as there was between Mac and Windows,” he says.The other difference involves applications. It took a long time before applications looked as good on Windows as they did on the Mac. But with Android, that’s not the case. In fact, in some ways Android might have an edge.“I used to ask Siri, ‘What are the five biggest lakes in California?’ and it would come back with the answer. Now it just misses. It gives me real estate listings. I used to ask, ‘What are the prime numbers greater than 87?’ and it would answer. Now instead of getting prime numbers, I get listings for prime rib, or prime real estate,” Woz says.Worse, a lot of the time Siri says it can’t make a connection to the back-end servers that power the system. “With the iPhone 4 I could press a button and call my wife. Now on the 4S I can only do that when Siri can connect over the Internet. But many times it can’t connect. I’ve never had Android come back and say, ‘I can’t connect over the Internet.’”The Android system also delivers better results, he says. “I have a lower success rate with Siri than I do with the voice built into the Android, and that bothers me,” Woz says. “I’ll be saying, over and over again in my car, ‘Call the Lark Creek Steak House,’ and I can’t get it done. Then I pick up my Android, say the same thing, and it’s done. Plus I get navigation. Android is way ahead on that.”Another gripe involves battery life. “With the iPhone, something happened with the new OS or the new phone, and it just started running through the battery so fast,” he says. “I’ve had a lot of issues with things I have to turn off just to save the battery life.”But Woz says he still recommends the iPhone as the best choice for most users. “The people I recommend the iPhone 4S for are the ones who are already in the Mac world, because it’s so compatible, and people who are just scared of computers altogether and don’t want to use them. The iPhone is the least frightening thing. For that kind of person who is scared of complexity, well, here’s a phone that is simple to use and does what you need it to do,” he says.

Nokia has just announced that it has sued Apple in Federal District Court in t"The patents in question relate to technologies for enhanced speech and data transmission, using positioning data in applications and innovations in antenna configurations that improve performance and save space, allowing smaller and more compact devices," according to a statement from the company.Although the wording is of course somewhat vague, the suit appears to hit the heart of what has made applications on the iPad and iPhone what they are. Positioning data in applications has become a central feature -- most of the major ones carry some type of location-aware technology.Nokia's suit surely comes as a surprise to the tech community, as it had not publicly made any indication that it believed its intellectual property rights had been violated. That said, it's not the first suitbetween the two companies: a suit last year involved GSM, UMTS, and Wi-Fi standards. A request for comment has been sent to Apple, however no response has been received as of press time. Also, Apple has sued HTCfor patent infringement. (See also "7 Patent Lawsuits That Affect Your Tech.")More details to come as we receive them.

Recording, communicating during protests, political events could be restrictedApple was granted a patent last week that will enable it to wirelessly disable the camera on iphones in certain locations, sparking fears that such techniques could be used to prevent citizens from communicating with each other or taking video during protests or events such as political conventions and gatherings.The camera phone has revolutionized the flow of information in the digital age. Any time a major event takes place, news networks and video websites are immediately inundated with footage and photographs from the scene.That could all change in the future however, with a flick of a switch, according to U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, published on Tuesday, titled, “Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device.”.Apparatus and methods for changing one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device, such as upon the occurrence of a certain event. In one embodiment, the event comprises detecting that the wireless device is within range of one or more other devices. In another variant, the event comprises the wireless device associating with a certain access point. In this manner, various aspects of device functionality may be enabled or restricted (device “policies”). This policy enforcement capability is useful for a variety of reasons, including for example to disable noise and/or light emanating from wireless devices (such as at a movie theater), for preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter “sleep mode” when entering a sensitive area.In other words, an encoded signal could be transmitted to all wireless devices, commanding them to disable recording functions.Obviously, the way this will be applied will depend on what is determined to be a “sensitive area” by the relevant authorities.To put it bluntly, the powers that be could control what you can and cannot document on your wireless devices according to their own whims.Given that the major technology companies are set to make wireless connectivity a major feature of the latest cameras, this development does not bode well for photographers and citizen journalists who are already experiencing a major crackdown on their first and fourth amendment rights.“If this type of technology became widely adopted and baked into cameras, photography could be prevented by simply setting a “geofence” around a particular location, whether it’s a movie theater, celebrity hangout spot, protest site, or the top secret rooms at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California.”Steve Watson is the London based writer and editor for Alex Jones’ Infowars.com, and Prisonplanet.com.

They say everyone's a critic these days, but here's a group whose critique matters: European carriers. Reuters has been asking questions at four major European telecom operators and reports that they're all dissatisfied with the company's current range of Lumia handsets. Describing the Windows Phone devices as overpriced due to their lack of real innovation, glitchy due to early battery life issues, and inadequately supported by Nokia's own marketing, the carriers seem to be in consensus about the new phones' failure to put up real competition to iOS and Android. Put in starker terms, they don't believe that Nokia's Lumia phones are "good enough" to compete. An executive in charge of mobile phones at one of the big Euro carriers is cited as saying, "no one comes into the store and asks for a Windows Phone," placing at least some of the blame for the tepid start to Nokia's reboot on Microsoft's shoulders."If the Lumia with the same hardware came with Android in it and not Windows, it would be much easier to sell."Credit rating agency Moody's has also been piling on, following Nokia's recent warning about lower-than-expected Q1 earnings, downgrading the Finnish company to a Baa3 rating and its outlook to "negative." Still, in Moody's more detailed assessment, Nokia is expected to be "accepted in the market in 2012," with Windows Phone becoming the third leading mobile platform behind iOS and Android.

An app that features a less than entirely honest Hollywood wheeler-dealer has been removed from Apple's App Store after a complaint from a super agent.I am sure honest Hollywood agents do exist. It's just that they don't seem to employ the finest PR firms to proselytize their honesty.This might explain why Oisin Hanrahan, the Irish creator of an iPhone app called SuperAgent, decided that the main character in his game might be a few scruples short of Mother Teresa.SuperAgent seems to have been well received, a reception that might have led to its being noticed by, well, Hollywood super agents.According to the Independent, one super agent may have enjoyed a particular interest in this app. His name is Ari Emanuel. He is the agent for so many important acting citizens such as Robert De Niro and Sacha Baron Cohen as well as directors such as Spike Lee. He is even thought to be the person upon whom the character of Ari Gold is based in the delightfully fluffy "Entourage" on HBO.What is important for today's story, however, is that he has reportedly set his more toothsome legal dogs upon Oisin Hanrahan and his company, Factory Six. You see, the slightly less than honest agent in the SuperAgent game is called Ari.While I leave you to gather your breath for a moment, let me just whisper that it is not the mere mention of Emanuel's first name that appears to have ruffled his hairline.The Independent kindly offers details of the cease-and-desist letter that has caused Apple to remove SuperAgent from the App Store."The game uses the name 'Ari' for the main character, which clearly is a reference to Mr Emanuel, the co-chief executive officer of WME, one of the world's premier talent agencies," begins the forceful cease-and-desist letter.It continues as forcefully it began: "[It] clearly intends to capitalize on using Mr Emanuel's and WME's names for the game and possibly mislead the public into thinking that Mr Emanuel and/or WME endorse the game - effectively trading off the goodwill, reputation and fame established by our clients."Hanrahan deftly told the Independent that because of the "Entourage" series, "Ari" is a name that symbolizes Hollywood in general, not one person in particular. He added: "We're a very small firm, of just three people, and since Apple pulled it we have had no income."I feel sure that many of you will sympathize with Hanrahan's plight. His arguments appear plausible. His game, just as the "Entourage" show, seems but an amusing diversion from the pains of everyday existence.But perhaps others might consider that while saying truth to power is an often alluring concept, one should always think carefully before saying jokes to power. Power is a sensitive soul, one that isn't always comfortable with japes. Somehow, for some powerful souls, taking a joke is like Samson admitting he'd always wondered what it would like to be bald.

Nissan isn?t the first name most associate with the cutting edge of gadget case technology, but their self-healing Scratch Shield iPhone case has the potential to be a revolutionary product in an already oversaturated market. The technology behind the ?self-repairing? case technology isn?t new, it?s been in use on several Nissan and Infiniti car models since 2005. The collaborative effort between the University of Tokyo and Advanced Soft Materials INC consists of an ?outer ?paint? made from polyrotaxane, which means that when damage occurs to the coating in the form of a fine scratch, the chemical structure is able to react to change back to its original shape and fill the gap ? ?healing? the blemish? according to Nissan. Nissan soft-launched the case over the weekend at an automotive event held in Dubai. Nissan handed a number of cases out to customers and journalists for beta testing and announced that if the demand was strong enough they would consider mass producing the cases for a release to the general public. Hopefully the beta testing creates a strong buzz, but that all depends on how well the self-healing feature of case works in real world use.The pockets of gadget owners can be unforgiving dungeons capable of scratching the toughest reinforced screens, and cases. However, if the underlying technology of Nissan?s cases has been used on cars for the last five years, I?m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the material's ability to withstand consumers' pockets.

She had been talking on it and navigating with a GPS app during a work trip to Los Angeles. Then, without any warning or error message, the phone quit.Everything was gone — all her contacts, photos and even the phone's ability to make calls.It was only after she got home to Silicon Valley that she found out that her phone had been killed by her employer, a publishing company.Someone in the IT department had sent out what's called a "remote wipe," a kind of auto-destruct command that's delivered by e-mail. The wipe was done by mistake, and Stanton wouldn't have been surprised to see this kind of remote control on a company phone.But this iPhone was hers."It was my account, in my name [and] I'd paid all the bills," Stanton says. "It didn't make any sense to me that somehow work could get through AT&T, who I thought controlled my phone, and could completely disable the phone and the account."It's no surprise to people who know IT. Since 2003, a growing list of smart phones have come loaded with software from Microsoft that makes remote wipes — and many other remote-control commands — possible.The phone doesn't need to download any new software. All that's necessary is for the phone's user to configure it to receive e-mail from a Microsoft Exchange Server — the kind most big companies use.Once that's been set up, an IT department has the capability to wipe the phone and turn off functions like Bluetooth, the Web browser and even the phone's camera."The reason why you see such a long list of various policies and controls is because different organizations want those controls," says Adam Glick, senior technical product manager for Microsoft Exchange.He points to the peace of mind the system offers to people whose phones have been stolen, and who can rest assured that all the personal information contained inside can be erased from afar.Glick says employers sometimes need remote control of other functions, like the camera, to prevent leaks. "If you're having an important meeting about the future finances of the organization and people put that up on a slide, and someone might take out their camera phone and take a picture. And then they might go and, say, post that to the Internet," Glick says.But when companies exert that kind of control over someone's personal phone, things can get messy. Anthony Davis runs IT for a manufacturing company in Seattle, and he says he makes a point of letting people know that when they opt to get company e-mail on their personal phones, they're signing up for more than just e-mail."We actually have a one-page waiver that says, you know, if you're going to connect your personal phone to the corporate e-mail system, that we do have the capabilities if the phone is lost to remote wipe it — and we will — and then have the employee agree [to] and sign that form," Davis says.But companies often aren't that transparent about the power e-mail gives them over personal phones. And it's not just phones.IT administrators can send similar commands to iPads and other personal devices that get work e-mail. Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute, says he's not sure what a court would say about a company that wipes an employee's phone without permission.But he says he'd like to find out: "I'm salivating right now at the prospect of this lawsuit."Maltby says there's now a breakdown of the old paradigm that your company controls work devices and you control yours and "never the twain shall meet.""Now, you have this gray world in which everything overlaps, and everything that's personal is business and vice versa, and now it's a mess," he says.Putting work e-mail on a personal device may be convenient, but for Stanton it's no longer worth the risk.After restoring her iPhone — or, as she calls it, her "precious iPhone" — she says she'll never put work e-mail on it again.

Nokia announced Friday that its chief executive will step down and will be replaced by a veteran from Microsoft, as the Finnish handset maker continues to look to create a smartphone that can compete with Apple's iPhone.Nokia announced in a press release Friday that Stephen Elop, who is currently head of Microsoft's Business Division, will become its new CEO on Sept. 21. Elop will replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, the current president and CEO, who has served as the company's head sine 2006. In that time, Kallasvuo and Nokia failed to develop a smartphone that could challenge Apple's iPhone, and have seen their market share slip , even though they remain the largest handset maker in the world. But while Nokia retains the lion's share of overall worldwide handset sales, it is dwarfed by Apple in terms of profit. In May, Kallasuvuo even publicly admitted that his company has failed to make a splash in the U.S. smartphone market, while Apple has taken the industry by storm with the iPhone and its digital storefront for third-party applications, the App Store. The company's best smartphones have struggled to compete in the high-end market with the likes of the iPhone and handsets based on Google's Android mobile operating system. "The time is right to accelerate the company's renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success," said Jorma Ollila, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors. "The Nokia board believes that Stephen has the right industry experience and leadership skills to realize the full potential of Nokia. His strong software background and proven record in change management will be valuable assets as we press harder to complete the transformation of the company." Though Kallasvuo will officially resign as president and CEO on Sept. 20, he will continue to chair the Board of Nokia Siemens Networks in a non-executive capacity. His severance package will net him 18 months of gross base salary and target incentive, totaling about 4.6 million euros. He will also be compensated for the 100,000 restricted shares of Nokia stock he was granted in 2007, which fully vest on Oct. 1, 2010. "The whole board of directors joins me in thanking Olli-Pekka for his thirty years at Nokia, during which he has been deeply involved in developing the company and its operations," Ollila said. "His dedication and contribution throughout the years has been exceptional. The board wishes him every success in his future pursuits." In addition to competing in the smartphone market, both Apple and Nokia are entrenched in a number of lawsuits related to patents. The first shot in the legal battle was fired by Nokia last October, when it accused Apple's iPhone of violating patents related to GSM and wireless LAN technology. It is believed that Nokia's losses in the market prompted the company to sue over the alleged use of 10 patented wireless standards in the iPhone. Apple responded to Nokia with its own lawsuit , accusing the Finnish company of infringing on 13 iPhone-related patents. The battle of the two smartphone giants is expected to drag out for years, with both companies looking for a court hearing to be held in 2012. The U.S. International Trade Commission -- the group with which the complaints were filed -- has agreed to look into both Nokia's and Apple's complaints against the other.

Seeing Han Solo emerge as a frozen block of carbonite was probably the hardest thing for me to come to terms with when I saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time -- I was young and Han is the man. That image will forever be burned into my skull and now another fellow frozen in carbonite has a place up there too. His name is Steve Jobs.That’s right, someone decided to take the Apple’s head honcho and freeze him in carbonite! No not really, it’s actually an iPhone case made of flexible plastic -- not carbonite -- and it doesn’t come with a real Steve Jobs. However, it is probably one of the coolest and most creative iPhone cases I have ever seen! The $35 price tag matches up pretty well other cases out there but, those other cases don’t come with your very own frozen prisoner so there really is no comparison. There were actually a few models; one for iPhone 4, 3G and 3GS and there were skins if you didn't want a hard case.Unfortunately, it looks like Apple wasn’t very happy about the whole deal and they have sent the creators a cease and desist, which is a total bummer but we definitely saw it coming. The cases have actually been on sale since March and with the all the attention something like this will gain it was only a matter of time before they had to stop. Sorry for getting your hopes up, but it was just too cool not to write about. We’ll let you know if anything official spurs from this as a Han Solo in carbonite case would have the same level awesomeness.Related Posts: Review: HBO's Game Of Thrones Episode 2: The Kingsroad The Force Is Strong With America's Best Dance Crew's 'Street Kingdom'Discuss this story in our Movies/TV forums!

The New YorkTimes is out with the second installment of its iEconomy series, which explores high-tech manufacturing in an era of globalization. Not surprisingly, Apple, America’s top technology company, is a central focus of the series. The first piece came out last weekend and described why so many consumer electronics — including Apple’s iPhone and iPad — are produced in Asia: it’s vastly cheaper than building them in the U.S. Although outsourcing and the consequent demise of the U.S. manufacturing sector is a perennially hot political issue, the economics of globalization suggest that U.S. jobs lost to cheaper overseas competition won’t be coming back.Thursday’s article focuses on working conditions at factories run by Apple’s Asian contractors, including Foxconn, which produces an estimated 40% of the world’s consumer electronics. It paints a grim picture and raises questions about the effectiveness of Apple’s supplier code of conduct, which sets standards for labor issue and safety protections. Apple says that when it discovers violations, it requires improvements. But the article suggests there are limits to Apple’s influence over the sprawling factories run by its contractors. And the company has even less impact on company plants that supply its contractors.(MORE: $100 Billion Question: What Should Apple Do with Its Cash?)So will we see some kind of movement to boycott Apple products, akin to the campaign several years ago to pressure Nike to improve working conditions in its factories? Seems unlikely at the moment. “You can either manufacture in comfortable, worker-friendly factories, or you can reinvent the product every year, and make it better and faster and cheaper, which requires factories that seem harsh by American standards,” an anonymous current Apple executive told the Times. “And right now, customers care more about a new iPhone than working conditions in China.”Among the highlights (or lowlights) of the article:Employees work excessive overtime, in some cases seven days a week, and live in crowded dorms. Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk. Underage workers have helped build Apple’s products, and the company’s suppliers have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records, according to company reports and advocacy groups that, within China, are often considered reliable, independent monitors.(MORE: Apple Reports Record Profits on Massive iPhone and iPad Sales)Several high-profile disasters have occurred at factories run by Apple contractors:Two years ago, 137 workers at an Apple supplier in eastern China were injured after they were ordered to use a poisonous chemical to clean iPhone screens. Within seven months last year, two explosions at iPad factories, including in Chengdu, killed four people and injured 77. Before those blasts, Apple had been alerted to hazardous conditions inside the Chengdu plant, according to a Chinese group that published that warning.One former Foxconn manager offered a scathing assessment of Apple priorities:“Apple never cared about anything other than increasing product quality and decreasing production cost,” said Li Mingqi, who until April worked in management at Foxconn Technology, one of Apple’s most important manufacturing partners. Mr. Li, who is suing Foxconn over his dismissal, helped manage the Chengdu factory where the explosion occurred. “Workers’ welfare has nothing to do with their interests,” he said.“We’ve known about labor abuses in some factories for four years, and they’re still going on,” said one former Apple executive who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. “Why? Because the system works for us. Suppliers would change everything tomorrow if Apple told them they didn’t have another choice.” “If half of iPhones were malfunctioning, do you think Apple would let it go on for four years?” the executive asked.Apple declined to comment for the story. It will be interesting to see if this series spurs consumers to put any pressure on Apple to do more to improve conditions in its supplier factories.

Following a report from earlier this month that claimed Apple’s (AAPL) next-generation iPhone will launch in the first half of 2013, new claims have emerged from the Far East that further support a summertime launch for Apple’s next iPhone. Digitimes cites unnamed market observers in stating that a number of Apple’s component suppliers are looking forward to strong first-quarter performance ahead of two big product launches slated to take place by mid-2013.The first, Apple’s next iPad, would be pretty surprising considering the November 2012 launch of Apple’s fourth-generation iPad model. The second, which would be just as surprising considering Apple’s recent shift to an annual fall launch timeframe, is a new iPhone.Digitimes provides no details surrounding the fifth-generation iPad or seventh-generation iPhone, but earlier reports claimed Apple’s manufacturing partners have already begun trial production of the next iPhone in an effort to avoid the yield issues that have plagued Apple’s previous iPhone launches.

You may find it hard to believe, but it’s possible to capture 3D scans with your iPhone using just the screen and the camera. The solution comes in the form of an app called Trimensional.The way in which it works is very simple, but the results are quite effective as the video above and images below show.In order to work you need to turn the brightness right up on your iPhone display, then stand in complete darkness. Hold the phone screen up to your face (around 20cm away) with the Trimensional app loaded, and tell it to starts scanning.The end result is a 3D scan of your face with the quality depending on how dark you managed to get the environment you are standing in.Here’s the full feature list of the first version of the app:For $0.99 on the App Store it gives you a new way to capture images of yourself, friends, or random objects which you can then share with others over e-mail, or manipulate them directly on your phone.The Trimensional website states it works best with iPhone 4 or the latest generation (4th) iPod touch. So if you have a previous generation phone or iPod check the iTunes comments first to see if anyone got it working.One update we’d like to see to the app is the ability to export the 3D model in a standard format 3D art packages can handle.Read more at the Trimensional website

Sprint has been something of an underdog in the U.S. wireless space for years now, and while the iPhone has absolutely changed the course of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, it has only recently started to ship on Sprint . The first change Sprint had to grab the iPhone came at the iPhone 4S event in October 2010, and while the real numbers are murky, it's estimated that Sprint invested billions over a number of years to make that deal happen. That's a lot of scratch for a carrier that is struggling to maintain a user base, and shareholders are finally speaking up about it. According to Reuters, Sprint's CEO Dan Hesse has agreed to a pay cut after "coming under fire from some shareholders disappointed with the hit the company's results took from subsidizing Apple's popular iPhones." Hesse has said that his salary will be cut in order to repay around $346,000 in incentive pay that he has already received, and he'll also give up additional amounts that was previously eligible for. Here's Hesse's statement: "These voluntary actions regarding my personal compensation, which total $3,250,830, will eliminate any benefit for me to the discretionary adjustment the compensation committee made earlier this year." Yeah, that's a lot of money, but the move will still put him at a salary level nearly in line with 2010 levels, and Sprint still has a long way to go before that $15 billion bet on the iPhone proves worthwhile.

AT&T, O2 feels your pain. Like AT&T, the U.K. mobile services provider has seen its network overtaxed by Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone, particularly in London, where a massive surge in data traffic has been causing network congestion since summer.In an interview with the Financial Times, O2 CEO Ronan Dunne said the company has seen an 18-fold increase in data traffic since the beginning of the year, most of it driven by super-smartphones like the iPhone. “Where we haven’t met our own high standards then there’s no question, we apologise to customers for that fact,” Dunne said. “But it would be wrong to say O2 has failed its customers en masse.”Well, that’s one way of looking at it. The thousands of smartphone users who lost data service just a few days ago might see things a bit differently, though. Anyway, O2–like AT&T in the U.S.–is doing its best to contain the public relations damage arising from such outages. Dunne says the carrier has added an additional 200 mobile base stations in London to help it meet data demand and has been working with its infrastructure suppliers on network tweaks to improve data service.Wise moves. Best to act quickly and get out ahead of issues like these, which can become PR nightmares very quickly. As AT&T recently learned, network congestion issues make great fodder for the advertising campaigns of rivals. Wouldn’t want Vodafone (VOD) running its own version of Verizon’s (VZ) nasty “There’s a Map for That” commercials, now would we?

Whenever you hear about bugs and exploits being discovered in the iPhone’s browser, Safari, it’s usually the doings of some masterful meddler who devoted hours to unearthing any flaws they could find — not some user casually tapping around the application. Apple’s pretty good at keeping things locked down, and the iPhone’s got enough users that most of the nasty user-facing bugs have been flushed out. Well, except for this new one.It’s not an incredibly common bug, and it doesn’t seem likely that it would hit most users – but for the iPhone users this newly discovered bug does affect, it could mean huge operator fees.The flaw, as discovered by Estonian Apple Site AppleSpot: If the user visits a site which uses Motion-JPEG (most commonly used for security cams and live feeds) in Safari, Safari will continue to gobble up bandwidth even after Safari is closed. Safari is one of the few apps that Apple allows to process in the background, and Motion-JPEG streams appear to continue streaming, even if the stream is in another tab or in the “closed” application. Apple gives no indication that Safari will continue to stream – and considering that most applications on the platform aren’t granted such privileges, it’s unlikely that a lay user would understand the consequences.As mentioned, this bug certainly isn’t one that springs up all that regularly; for it to affect you, you need to not only visit one of these Motion-JPEG streams in Safari, but also be on some sort of pay-per-megabyte plan. While it’s no sweat off the backs of anyone on an unlimited package (as is the case with a vast majority of US iPhone users), it could work out to MASSIVE wallet damage for anyone traveling internationally or who are signed up on carriers that only offer metered data.The original discoverers of the bug claim to have been able to rack up over 740 megabytes in silently streamed data during one hour of testing. If the same thing had happened to someone without a data package, they say that one hour of unintentional data usage would have worked out to roughly 30,000 Estonian kroons in fees – or just shy of $3,000 dollars. Ouch.

Microsoft's Office for iPad, iPhone, and Android is a reality. Although Office Mobile has been rumored and reportedly spotted in the wild, Microsoft has remained persistently quiet about its plans for the product. The Verge has learned through several sources close to Microsoft's plans that the company will release Office versions for Android and iOS in early 2013.Office Mobile will debut in the form of free apps that allow Android and iOS users to view Microsoft Office documents on the move. Like the existing SkyDrive and OneNote apps, Office Mobile will require a Microsoft account. On first launch, a Microsoft account will provide access to the basic viewing functionality in the apps. Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents will all be supported, and edit functionality can be enabled with an Office 365 subscription.Microsoft will allow iOS users to purchase an Office 365 subscription within the app, or let organizations distribute codes to enable Office Mobile editing for users. The apps will allow for basic editing, but we're told this won't go very far in attempting to replace regular full use of a desktop Office version.A recent Microsoft press release from the company's Czech Republic subsidiary revealed that Office Mobile apps for Android and iOS would be made available from March 2013. We understand that Office Mobile for iOS will arrive first in late February or early March, with an Android version due in May.We reached out to Microsoft for comment on this story and a company spokesperson says "Office will work across Windows Phone, iOS and Android."

UPDATE: I have run out of promo codes, but really appreciate all the positive comments and support. If you have feedback, please feel free to email me at jacobu@gmail.com. I can only do some much QA testing on my own, and it's not until something gets into the hands of the masses that it can truly be torn apart :-D. I'll do my best to reply to all your messages and fix anything that needs fixing. I will release a bug fix version within a few days (+approval time, ~2-3 days), and will likely give out more free copies then. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.So for the last 2 months, I've been cranking away on an app called Aetherspark. It's a file browser, storage, and transfer system. It lets you mount your iPad as a disk from any OS (via WebDAV), transfer files to it, and browse them on the device. You can also upload and browse files on your device with a web browser. It even lets you send files between devices (even without wifi). Yes, it's a bit like AirSharing, but the interface is significantly different, and it has file transfer capabilities. It's also cheaper.Here are some demo videos Here's the app store linkI have 50 promo codes (most I can get per version) that I want to give out for a free download, so if you want one, please send me a private message and I'll give you one (if I haven't run out).I'm not only looking to get the word out about it, I'm also looking for feedback (both suggestions and problems you have with it).A slight caveat, the promo codes only work in the U.S. iTunes store. Nothing I can do about this unfortunately. :-(

With portable navigation systems hanging from millions of windshields and the price point of the popular devices diving down to the $99 mark, automakers’ expensive in-dash nav systems are going the way of the car phone. But with mobile-phone based navigation gaining ground — and the new 3-G iPhone expected to debut on Monday with full GPS capability — portable navs could soon face a similar fate.Phone-based GPS navigation has been steadily gaining ground on portables. Earlier this week, Networks in Motion, the leading provider of navigation services to the top four U.S. cellular carriers, announced that the day before Mother’s Day, May 10, saw the largest spike ever in the use of navigation on mobile phones, with nearly 5 million requests.That’s a lot of drivers finding their way to mom’s house. And looking at a small screen while driving.Portable navigation has experienced phenomenal growth over the past several years, while automakers’ expensive in-dash systems have been shown to increase the depreciation of a vehicle. But the use of GPS-enabled mobile phones isexpected to quadruple by 2011, and if GPS is introduced on the new iPhone, as expected, it could accelerate the shift away from portable nav systems. And as Popular Mechanics reported, leave GPS suppliers "scared %#*@-less." Portable nav heavyweight Garmin already introduced an iPhone-like GPS phone earlier this year, and last week minor player Mio unveiled two similar GPS phones. Now, all eyes will be on Steve Jobs on Monday when the Apple Godhead is expected to unveil the iPhone 2.0 with built-in GPS at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.The market is ripe for it. Networks in Motion, which claims to have a 57 percent share of U.S. revenue from navigation services offered on mobile phones, says that in early in 2007 it had less than a million paid users. Now it has more than 3 million, and in May it reached the milestone of more than 100 million monthly navigation requests.But the biggest challenge will be how to deal with driver distraction issues in moving from the small screen of portable navs to the even smaller screen of mobile phones.Let’s see if Apple will show the way.

Once the best of friends, Google and Apple have been warring for months now. First there was Apple's rejection of Google Voice from the App Store, which was soon followed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt stepping down from Apple's board of directors. And then let's not forget about Google positioning its Android OS to challenge the iPhone, Steve Jobs calling Google's "Don't be Evil" mantra bs, and of course, Apple indirectly going after Android by suing HTC for patent infringement.All in all, while Apple and Google still work closely on some initiatives, a new wrinkle in their relationship appears to manifest itself every couple of weeks. And now we have yet another example on our hands.The word "Google" is so ingrained as part of our everyday lexicon that it's now referenced as a verb more so than anything else - i.e "Did you Google it?" In fact, Google is so synonymous with 'Search' that in the current version of mobile Safari, where Google is the default search engine, users press a "Google" button after they've typed in their web query.  But those days appear long gone.In the new iPhone OS 4, the "Google" button has been replaced by a more generic "Search" button. Does this mean that Apple is indeed considering a deal with Microsoft whereby Bing would become the default search engine on the iPhone? Or maybe it's simply an indication that Apple doesn't want to give Google free branding promotion on the iPhone, even if it happens to be the default search engine.I, for one, hope Apple's hyper-competiveness regarding the iPhone and Android doesn't cloud their judgement to the extent that Bing becomes the default search engine on the iPhone. While Microsoft has certainly made some strides with their search engine offering, it simply can't compete with Google. At least not yet, anyways. The iPhone is all about quality, and it seems a bit backwards to push Google search aside when it's clearly the highest quality search engine available. While Google search would still be available as an option in a Bing/iPhone world, why make users wade into the system preferences to begin with?

Denied the opportunity to make the argument in court that the design of the original iPhone was derived from Sony concepts, Samsung has decided to make it in the court of public opinion. Moments ago, the company released to the media two batches of evidence excluded from the trial currently occuring in San Jose, Calif., along with the following statement:The Judge’s exclusion of evidence on independent creation meant that even though Apple was allowed to inaccurately argue to the jury that the F700 was an iPhone copy, Samsung was not allowed to tell the jury the full story and show the pre-iPhone design for that and other phones that were in development at Samsung in 2006, before the iPhone. The excluded evidence would have established beyond doubt that Samsung did not copy the iPhone design. Fundamental fairness requires that the jury decide the case based on all the evidence.A brazen statement, particularly the last line which seems to express hope that members of the jury will see the excluded evidence. But evidently Samsung’s legal team is not at all happy with the way the trial has progressed so far.Ahead of opening arguments on Monday, Samsung lawyer John Quinn asked the court to hear further arguments and allow evidence showing that Samsung designs for what became the P700 predate the iPhone. Judge Lucy Koh denied the request, saying that she had already heard three motions to reconsider the point and noting once again that the evidence had been excluded for good reason: it was introduced far too late in the discovery process.Quinn persisted, saying he was begging the court to hear more discussion, something he said he hadn’t done in his 30-plus years of law.“You’ve made your record for appeal,” Koh said. “Don’t make me sanction you, please.”Update: Apple’s legal team was quick to take issue with Samsung’s release of evidence excluded from the trial, saying the action was contemptible. Judge Koh was none too pleased with the move herself, calling for an immediate meeting with Quinn.“Tell Mr. Quinn I’d like to see him today,” Koh said. “I want to know who drafted the press release, who authorized it from the legal team.”

For some time now, rumors of the GPhone (or Google phone) have been circulating around the web.  While it didn't make a whole lot of sense that Google was going to get into the hardware business, especially the highly competitive handset business, it seemed reasonable that Google had an interest in the handheld market for obvious reasons, not the least of which is the huge potential in search.  Though, as we came to find out, it wasn't so much the hardware but the "platform" that Google was interested in.  Tomorrow (9/23) will bring a lot more clarity to Google's play in the handset business, according to Time , as the first ever Google Andriod operating system-based handset is set for retail availability with T-Mobile customers.  The T-Mobile Dream is go for launch.The sweetest part of the Dream is the Android Market — Google's answer to the Apple App Store. Whereas many Apple apps cost money (typically anywhere from $.99 to $9.99), at launch all Android Market apps will be free. That includes BreadCrumbz, a picture-based navigation program that doesn't just give you a drawing of your route, but also includes real-world photos to keep you on track. Another interesting app, TuneWiki, is a tricked-out music player that encourages mobile karaoke, by synchronizing written lyrics onscreen to the song's YouTube video.Let's see, open source, major player support in key enabling technologies like search and navigation, freeware utilities to the public --  Apple, you can be afraid now, very afraid.This video of the Android concept was published a little less than a year ago and it's still pretty impressive.  Now if they could just find a real service carrier, we'd be in business.

It's all kicking off: Apple has called an emergency press conference to address the controversy surrounding the iPhone 4 and its incredible shrinking phone signal.iPhone 4 has been plagued with controversy since it first arrived in customers' hands, and owners quickly discovered those very hands broke their new £500 phone. It may be the dog and bone everyone and their gran has heard of, tweeted about, and featured in a hilarious webcomic, but it divides opinion like few other tech products -- and has even led to a share price nosedive.Apple's official stance is that the reception issues are the result of a long-standing software glitch that displays the wrong number of signal bars. So far, Apple has refused to acknowledge the alleged hardware problems caused by wrapping the phone's two antennas around the outside of the phone.Fortunately, someone has seen the funny side: Microsoft COO Kevin Turner joked at the MS Worldwide Partner Conference that "the iPhone 4 might be their Vista". The wag! Wasn't so blinkin' funny in 2005, Kev.If you aresuffering an iPhone 4 signal catastrophe, Crave is here to help: we show you how to fix your iBlower with our patented CNET UK iPhone 4 super-reception stick. We've also rounded up a selection of our favourite iPhone 4 cases.So what will Apple announce? Look no further than Crave, as we'll be closely following the press conference. It all kicks off tomorrow, Friday 16 July 2010, at 5pm BST, as if we've got nothing better to do on a Friday night.Will Steve Jobs announce a recall? Will Gray Powell's head be served up on an iPad? Will there be free bumpers for everyone? Or will El Steve be slowly wheeled across the stage in a wheelbarrow full of money, impassively flicking the Vs?Tell us your predictions in the comments, or on our official Facebook page. And most importantly, tell us has Apple finally jumped the shark?

the dreaded words 'No Service' plague my iPhone's (beautiful) screen.i decide to take the SIM card out and place it into my eight-year-old Nokia 6100. i turn it on. and now i see 'O2 - UK' and a full 7 bars! i place a call. i hear it ringing. my friend answers. we have our chat. all is well. i hang up and, apart from the handset getting slightly warm, i'm happy.i don't know about you but I want my phone to be able to place calls first and foremost. everything else is secondary.so is my phone faulty or has technology really gone backwards at Apple? how would I convince them to give me a new phone or a refund? your thoughts would be appreciated.EDIT: I have tried switching 3G both on and off. I leave things like Push, Wifi, Bluetooth, Notifications, etc all off. I find it has bad reception generally whenever I go indoors and, even when I leave a building or come out of the underground, it takes a while for it to find a signal.

BEIJING (AP) — Foxconn Technology Group denied on Saturday that production was affected at a Chinese factory that makes Apple’s iPhones, although both state media and an overseas labor watch group said some workers halted production lines on Friday, apparently over higher quality control standards.China Labor Watch, based in New York, reported that 3,000 to 4,000 workers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou in central China went on strike Friday over increased quality control demands and having to work during an extended national holiday.The state news agency Xinhua, quoting a spokesman for the management committee of the Xinzheng Comprehensive Bonded Area where the plant is, said some production lines were halted Friday when workers persuaded quality inspectors to skip work to show dissatisfaction over higher quality standards.In a statement on Saturday, Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, said production at the Zhengzhou plant continued without interruption. It denied any strike or work stoppage.Foxconn said there were two isolated, small-scale disputes between production line workers and quality assurance personnel on Monday and Tuesday.Xinhua said some workers were unhappy when Apple strengthened quality inspections of the iPhone 5 after consumer complaints regarding aesthetic flaws in the phone. In the Xinhua report, the spokesman was unable to provide a specific number of workers involved.

Recently reunited German electro-punk spazzes Atari Teenage Riot are still causing controversy. ATR's iPhone app has been delayed by the German iTunes store due to a dispute over its content. The free app is set to feature every ATR album, song, and video, as well as photos, news updates, and more. But it also included something called "Riotsounds Produce Riots", an audio player that features sounds that ATR used at a May Day protest in 1999, at which the band members were arrested.According to a press release, those sounds include "very low sub basses, square waves, noise sounds which trigger hysteria and panic within the audience." So your iPhone could make a whole lot of people very uncomfortable, if hooked up to big speakers-- which ATR encourages, via press release.But Apple has held up the app's release while they investigate whether it's legal to release an app with all those noises on it. The band had hoped to get the app out in time for this year's May 1 protests, but that didn't happen.Responding to inquiries about the app's status, ATR mastermind Alec Empire writes, "Today's status is that the ATR iPhone will be released within the next ten days. The Riotsounds player might be added later with an update. It's a legal loophole. So not sure yet what the outcome will be. But the free app which includes all ATR songs and videos plus a lot of extras will still be pretty awesome, even if the Riotsounds player is not included in this version. ATR plans regular updates for the app including free bonus tracks, unreleased songs, outtakes and more."On May 24, the group will release the reunion single "Reactivate" on their own Digital Hardcore label.

First came the rumors. Then came the leaked images. And now, 3 all-knowing (conveniently unnamed) analysts have predicted that Verizon’s long awaited foray into Android will happen some time next week with the announcement of Motorola’s Sholes/Tao smartphone. The timing seems feasible, especially considering that Motorola is holding a MOTODEV Android-related press event next Tuesday, October 6 (WinMo 6.5 who?).But, this is far from certain, folks. In fact, we have it on good word that Verizon retail employees have yet to train on Android, making a near term launch that much less likely. However, that does not rule out an announcement only like the recent Motorola CLIQ event.Either way, the speculation is definitely heating up. Just this morning the friendly folks over at AndroidGuys have posted information suggesting the Tao (or whatever it will end up being called) will be released on December 1, just in time for the all-mighty holiday shopping bonanza. But the fun doesn’t stop there.According to the super secret document that found its way to AndroidAndMe, the Tao will purportedly be the “world’s thinnest” slider QWERTY phone at 13.7mm thick. Yes, please! Other juicy tidbits include: a 3.7? 16:9 touch screen display, 16GB built-in storage, 5MP camera with dual LED flash, full HTML browser with Flash support, and supposedly the next generation of Android, the big 2.0.Here are the rest of the leaked specs:

An Apple iPhone 3GS sits on a cradle at a Singtel showroom ahead of the phone launch this evening in Singapore in this July 10, 2009 file photo.The world's top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday, saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer, a key factor in the success of iPhone, and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a "free ride" on Nokia's technology investment.Apple, a latecomer to the cellphone industry, has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market, but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals, when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements.Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $200 million and $1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far.In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $566, according to Strategy Analytics.The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies, alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson."It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies," said Ben Wood, research director at CCS Insight.An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple.Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis, but the U.S. firm had declined those.The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties, but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders. For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower."Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space. As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Qualcomm," CCS Insight's Wood said.Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model, and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies."This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name. They wanted it, and needed it, in the same way they need Nokia's technologies," said Steven Nathasingh, managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc.Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007, after Apple unveiled its iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. The lawsuit was short lived, and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the "iPhone" trademark.Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple, which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007.In July-September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter, while Apple saw its market share rising."The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit. This has to create concern for Nokia," Nathasingh said.Nokia's previous major legal battle ended last year with a one-time payment of 1.7 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15-year patent agreement.(Additional reporting by Ian Sherr in San Francisco; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)

The iPhone 4?s screen may be the best mobile display yet, but its resolution does not exceed the human retina, as Steve Jobs claims.The math just doesn’t add up, said Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, who explained that the iPhone 4?s purported “retina display” was a misleading marketing term.“It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far,” Soneira said.During his keynote speech, Jobs said the iPhone 4?s display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. He claimed that this resolution exceeds the limit of the human retina, which Jobs said was 300 pixels per inch for a display about a foot away.“It turns out there’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch, that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes, is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels,” Jobs said.Soneira, who possesses a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton and has been studying displays for 20 years, said it was inaccurate to measure the resolution of the eye in terms of pixels, because the eye actually has an angular resolution of 50 cycles per degree. Therefore, if we were to compare the resolution limit of the eye with pixels on a screen, we must convert angular resolution to linear resolution. After conversions are made, a more accurate “retina display” would have a pixel resolution of 477 pixels per inch at 12 inches, Soneira calculated.He noted, however, that he was confident Apple will have the best phone display on the market. Like the iPad’s LCD display, the iPhone 4?s screen features In-Plane Switching technology, in which crystal molecules are oriented so their motion is parallel to the panel rather than perpendicular. For viewers, the result is a very wide viewing angle — up to 180 degrees — with brilliant color. Soneira added that we might not realistically need anything better than 326 ppi.For comparison, glossy magazines are typically printed at 300 dots per inch.Soneira said he wanted to highlight that “retina display” is a symptom of a larger problem of market puffery in the display industry. Basically, many manufacturers exaggerate claims about their display specifications — everything from resolution to viewing angle, and from brightness to contrast — and they have to do it because everyone is doing it.“The marketing puffery is now in control,” Soneira said. “Everything that’s being said now is just this superamplified imaginary nonsense, and the only way to get people’s attention now is making more outlandish statements.”For example, Soneira discarded Sharp’s Quattron TVs that claimed to display four primary colors (as opposed to the traditional three) as utter nonsense. He explained in an earlier Maximum PC guest article that all television and movie content is produced and color balanced in the traditional RGB color arrangement. Sharp Quattron’s fourth primary color is yellow, and there is nothing for it to do because yellow is already reproduced with mixtures of the red and green primaries, he said.“[Market puffery] hurts companies that make good products, like Apple, because they can’t really put the specs out because everybody is lying,” Soneira said. “If you and I have the world’s greatest display, and we launched it and put down the real scientific numbers, we’d go bankrupt because our numbers would look like the worst display being made.”

Not interested in waiting until the 23rd for Verizon's big announcement? Don't worry, we've got you covered right now! The Motorola Droid X has probably been one of the worst kept smartphone secrets in recent memory, but after spending two hours with the phone we sort of see why. In short, it's pretty awesome. Call it a superphone or a mega-smartphone, but the 4.3-inch handset is absolutely Verizon / Motorola's answer to the HTC EVO 4G , and makes the Droid Incredible look like a bench warmer. What do we mean? We'll let you see for yourself just after the break in a breakdown of exactly what this phone is all about -- and in a video or three of it in action. Oh, and on your way down, make sure to feast your eyes on the gallery, too. So here are our main takeaways: Pretty promising, isn't it? We should know more when we get an announcement toward the end of the month, but in the mean time, we're really excited about what Moto's got going on here. There have been conflicting reports on the Droid X's screen size. We're going with 4.3-inches for now. Sam Sheffer contributed to this article.

Under the radar of this week’s WWDC news is a small but very significant change to the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement. The change is in the oft-controversial section 3.3.2. Here is the last sentence of the old copy:Here is the new copy:Unless otherwise approved by Apple in writing, no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with Apple’s prior written consent, an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application.?I’ve said before that Apple’s aversion to interpreted code and external runtimes is the potential for someone else to take the platform over. That’s not the whole story, though. Games in particular tend to use engines and libraries that leverage interpreted languages such as Lua. Many of these applications pose no threat, neither implicitly nor explicitly.While explicit approval from Apple is still required, these new terms seem to acknowledge that there’s a difference between an app that happens to have non-compiled code, and a meta-platform. It’s a step that should allow for many new possibilities.

With Apple's top marketing executive on the stand and under oath, Samsung's lawyers attempt to pry out information about Apple's next iPhone.SAN JOSE, Calif. -- There's been no shortage of once-confidential Apple information spilling out recently, ahead of the Apple v. Samsung patent trial here. But with the proceedings in full swing, today could have brought the biggest revelation of all.During the cross-examination of Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller, Samsung's attorney tried to get the executive to talk about a product that hasn't been announced yet.In an attempt to get Schiller talking about design, Samsung attorney William Price asked Schiller whether Apple's next iPhone model would look anything like existing versions, or if changes were in store.Apple's legal team jumped up to object the question immediately, telling U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh that an answer would be divulging confidential information. After a brief pause, Koh overruled, saying she would let Price ask the question.Schiller, looking nervous, sought confirmation from Price of what had just been asked of him. Then he said, "I prefer not to tell confidential information about future products."Apple is expected to roll out a new version of the iPhone next month, per numerous rumors. That event is rumored to take place on September 12, by which time this trial will presumably be wrapped up.You can check out CNET's complete coverage of the trial here. And our roundup of iPhone 5 rumors is here.

After initially denying it, Apple has acknowledged the iPhone 5's purple flare camera problem in an email to a Gizmodo reader. Their solution: "Angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures."Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera. If you wish to reach me regarding this case number *********, please contact me at 1-877-***-**** ext. *******. I currently work Thursday-Monday: 7:00am - 3:30pm Mountain Time. If you reach my voicemail, please leave your name, phone number, case number and the best time to reach you. Email is ***********@apple.com.Long time Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel received this email after a long call with Apple support regarding the Purple Flare problem in his phone, which apparently is a feature common to every iPhone 5:Initially I was told that it shouldn't happen and that it is strange. My call was escalated to a senior support individual who again said it was odd and shouldn't happen. I sent her some pics of the issue and she in turn sent them to the engineering team.Her final response is what you can see at the top of this article. Some photography experts have speculated that the purple flare is a product of the sapphire glass covering the iPhone 5's camera.So it is final, folks: Apple says that, if your photos have a purple flare, this is totally normal behavior of the iPhone 5's camera. You are just holding it wrong.Also, it's not Apple's fault that the Sun is purple. [Thanks Matt!]

UPDATE: Now It’s Personal: Apple ditches private investigator, personally taking on teen who sold white iPhone 4 kits > Read the breaking news here !A 17-year-old geek from Queens has turned the fervor for the unreleased white iPhone 4 into a six-figure business — enough to send himself to college, so long as he can stay out of trouble with the law.The unbelievable demand among Apple enthusiasts for the long-delayed white version of the iPhone 4 has been compared to the hunt for that legendary white whale, Moby Dick.So when Fei Lam, a high school senior and gadget nerd, got a tip about buying up some white iPhone 4 parts, he saw the opportunity to finally make his passion for electronics pay off.According to Lam, who speaks fluent Chinese, about six months ago he was able to make a connection with Apple’s infamous overseas supplier. “I knew a guy from a few years back that had somewhat of a relationship with folks in Foxconn,” Lam told The Observer by email.Lam created a site, whiteiphonefournow.com, to sell conversion kits that turn regular iPhone 4?s into their elusive white version.NEED A FUNNY SLIDE SHOW? CLICK HERE FOR : IF STEVE JOBS’ NECK COULD SEND HIM A TEXT MESSAGE, WHAT WOULD IT SAY?During the first month or so, Lam only sold one or two parts a day, and because he was getting the pieces himself, repacking and shipping them, he actually lost money.But he quickly figured out how to have the parts ship direct and his venture was noticed by major sites like TechCrunch, CNET and CNN, helping him to sell more than $130,000 worth of parts since this past August.“I’m very thankful, cause for months I was struggling for an idea that would bootstrap my first startup and help pay for college,” says Lam, who hopes to attend NYU and study computer science or business.Yesterday however, Lam received an ominous letter. “I got an email from a private investigator accusing me of selling stolen goods, which I’m 100 percent sure is not the case. They are some kind of anti-counterfeit/trademark firm, which sounds ridiculous, similar to what Apple is bringing up to remove White iPhone 4 Listings on eBay. I don’t know how this legal stuff works.”The consequences for selling stolen good online can be steep. In September a women in Kansas was convicted of selling stolen goods on eBay. She faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.Lam intends to contact a lawyer and has no plans to take his site down or change his business. “There are a couple of other sellers online and somehow I’m the ‘focus’ of it all. I think this guy is just trying to scare me into stop selling on behalf of Apple.”He can take heart in the fact that Steve Jobs, along with his partner Steve Wozniak, helped to fund their first business selling “Blue Boxes” that let users make illegal long distance telephone calls.The Observer has reached out to Apple for comment.Read the thrilling part 2 of the Fei Lam story here: Apple ditches their P.I., now it’s personal!If Steve Jobs Neck Could Send Him A Text Message, What Would it Say?Can Joe Einhorn Build A Database of Every Object in the World?

Hey iPhone users: how many times a day do you take your beloved device out of your pocket just to check the time, change the tune, check email or see who's calling? What if we wore some kind of notification device on our wrists -- let's call them watches -- that could connect to your iPhone to do all of the above and more? And what if it didn't cost an arm and a leg?[More from Mashable: Snapstagram Wants to Print Your Instagram Photos [VIDEO]]Smart watches aren't exactly a new notion. In the past year we've seen and reviewed several: the InPulse, the WiMM One and the oddly-named I'm Watch. But they were all powered by Android, or connected to Android smartphones only.iPhone owners were out of luck -- until Wednesday, when a new smart watch by the guy behind InPulse (Eric Migicovsky, above) hit funding site Kickstarter. Dubbed the Pebble, it's the first smart watch that can form a meaningful, long-lasting relationship with your iOS device, as well as Android.[More from Mashable: 10 Waterproof Smartphone Cases to Prevent Disaster]And it's nothing if not popular. The Kickstarter campaign asked for $100,000 in funding; it got that in the first two hours. By day's end, the device had more than $500,000 in pledges.What's so smart about the Pebble? Well, for starters, it doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Other smart watches offer color screens as if they're trying to be a mini-smartphone. The Pebble lets your iPhone do all the heavy lifting. Its simple e-paper display -- much like the original Kindle -- is viewable even in direct sunlight, which is pretty necessary for a watch.It is also releasing its software kit to developers, so they can create their own iPhone app-linking apps. Out of the box, you'll be able to see incoming emails and calls, track your run and your bike ride via your phone's GPS, as well as use your watch as a remote for the music app on your phone.That feature alone seems worth the asking price -- which, by the way, will be $149.Check out the video below for more, and let us know in the comments: would you wear this?This story originally published on Mashable here.

As Verizon iPhone speculation heats up ahead of tomorrow's Verizon Wireless press conference, it appears that even rival AT&T can't keep its mouth shut.Yesterday, AT&T's vice president of communications, Larry Solomon, told Business Insider that "the iPhone is built for speed, but that's not what you get with a CDMA phone. I'm not sure iPhone users are ready for life in the slow lane."Several publications have taken Solomon's comment as proof positive that Verizon will announce the Apple iPhone tie-up tomorrow.Verizon hasn't commented on the trash talk, but this morning Verizon's policy blog editor John Czwartacki retweeted an article entitled "Rant: AT&T should shut up about Verizon iPhone."Does Solomon's claim have merit? If the Verizon iPhone confirms carriage on its legacy 3G network rather than its nascent 4G LTE network as most believe, then the answer is yes.Big Red may deliver more consistency and capacity than AT&T, especially in San Francisco and New York, but in PCMag's search for the Fastest Mobile Networks 2010 we found that AT&T performed faster than Verizon nationwide. It delivered average download speeds of 1.79Mbits/sec compared to Verizon's 1.01Mbits/sec.Instead of fighting speed, Verizon appears to be attacking the AT&T iPhone's Achilles' heel: capacity. Over the weekend the Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Verizon was "confident enough in its network" to offer unlimited data plans with the iPhone.

When it comes to smartphones, Apple's iPhone may be top of mind, but mobile devices with Google Android guts pose the biggest threat to Jobs and Co.According to a new market research study from Google-owned AdMob, the iPhone held about a 50 percent share of the global operating system (OS) market for smartphone devices browsing the internet in February 2010. While that statistic may not be surprising, AdMob found that Google Android is creeping up from behind, capturing about 24 percent of the market share. Nokia-owned Symbian placed third with 18 percent of the market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (RIM) and Microsoft Windows Mobile are left in the dust with a paltry 4 percent and 2 percent of market share, respectively, despite its solid smartphone sales.In the U.S., AdMob found that in February 2010 the Apple iPhone operating system held a 44 percent market share, down from 55 percent in November 2009; while Android's share rose in the U.S. from 27 percent in November to 42 percent in the most recent AdMob report.While Apple maintained a 50 percent market share globally, Google Android devices like the Motorola Droid, the Motorola CLIQ, and a slew of HTC handhelds like the Dream, the Hero and the Magic helped push Google Android to No. 2, according to the study results."Android was the fastest growing operating system in the AdMob network year-over-year," the study explained. "Android's share of smartphone requests increased from 2 percent in February 2009 to 24 percent in February 2010."The study, according to AdMob, illustrates that Apple iPhone and Google Android users take advantage of the mobile Internet more than users of competing devices.AdMob services mobile ads for more than 15,000 mobile Web sites and applications globally and stores and analyzes the data from every ad request, impression and click within its network and issues monthly reports based on that data to evaluate the mobile device and mobile Internet ecosystem.Other findings in AdMob's most recent study show that smartphones accounted for about 48 percent of AdMob's worldwide traffic in February 2010, which was up from 35 percent in February 2009. The increase in smartphone traffic pushed traffic from feature phones down. Feature phone use declined from 58 percent a year ago to 35 percent in February 2010.

Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch cancels his C4 programming conference in the wake of an Apple change he sees as stifling programming innovation.New restrictions that Apple added to its iPhone software developer kit have led an independent programmer to cancel a conference devoted to Mac programming and computer science.Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch announced Wednesday he canceled the C4 conference after four years organizing it because of new wording in a section of the iPhone OS 4.0 software developer kit."With resistance to Section 3.3.1 so scattershot and meek, it's become clear that I haven't made the impact I wanted with C4. It's also clear my interests and the Apple programming community's interests are farther apart than I had hoped," Rentzsch said.Central to the matter is the battle between Apple and Adobe Systems concerning Flash, an Adobe programming foundation widely used on the Web but banished from the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Apple further restricted even native applications originally written in Flash with new wording in section 3.3.1 of the iPhone OS 4.0 SDK, leading Adobe to cancel a Flash-for-iPhone programming tool as well. CEO Steve Jobs explained in a rare open letter in April, but his words didn't satisfy Rentzsch."By itself Section 3.3.1 wasn't enough to cause me to quit C4. I've weathered Apple lying to me and their never-ending series of autocratic App Store shenanigans. But unlike previous issues such as the senseless iPhone SDK NDA [nondisclosure agreement], the majority of the community isn't riled by 3.3.1. On this issue, Apple apologists have the loudest voice. They offer soothing, distracting yet fundamentally irrelevant counterpoints to Apple's naked power-grab."Rentzsch said he was motivated to produce C4 because he wanted to marry Mac programmers' "maniacal focus on user experience" with better low-level programming tools."I believed the best way to move software forward was to inform Apple programmers about better ways to build software--to infect the best top-downer minds with fertile discontent," he said. "My hope was that developers would care primarily about user experience yet also be passionate about utilizing lingual and tooling advances."Apple has thwarted that hope, though, with the new SDK license terms. Those read: "Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g., Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited).""Section 3.3.1 has broken my spirit," Rentzsch said. "Apple is crazy-innovative in terms of hardware and software design, but I can count the total number of software engineering advances they've made on one hand. Section 3.3.1 makes developers wholly reliant on Apple for software engineering innovation."Apple, which didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday, has offered an explanation for the change to the programming tools license."We know from painful experience that letting a third-party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in substandard apps, and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third-party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features," Jobs said in his open letter. "We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers."

Yes, but what has France to say?Samsung is demanding the source code of the iPhone 4S firmware, while Apple wants copies of Samsung's contract with Qualcomm and both companies are looking to France in their Australian case.France is important, as that's where the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is based and where Samsung agreed to license critical 3G patents on a Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) basis. But, as Australian business title iTnews reports, Samsung reckons Apple is breaching three of its patents, while Apple reckons the Qualcomm chips it uses come with patent rights, so wants to see the contract Samsung has with Qualcomm.Samsung is seeking an injunction on the iPhone 4S in Australia, though the only patents it can apply are fundamental to the W-CDMA (3G) standard and thus fall into the ETSI-mandated FRAND policy. Apple reckons it is free to use those patents having bought chips from Qualcomm, and Qualcomm has a licence from Samsung which Apple has seen, but only in a form so redacted as to be useless to its case.Apple has previously argued that its licence to the Lodsys (mobile payments) patents should also cover users of its services (mobile developers taking payments through iTunes), so Cupertino obviously believes patent rights should be transferable, but that will depend on the contract Samsung has with Qualcomm, which is why Apple wants to see it.Samsung, meanwhile, wants to see the iPhone 4S firmware so it can establish that Apple really is breaching its patents, something Apple still denies.Samsung has tried to get injunctions against the 4S in America, France and Italy, where cases continue, with only the Dutch courts ruling in Apple's favour. Samsung is also pursuing a separate case though the Australian courts, involving the same three patents, and four others, in the increasingly impenetrable battle between the two companies.In this instance the judge reckons all these demands for documents mean the case isn't going to fit into the four-day schedule, and will start considering which of the various document requests should be sustained when the case continues on Friday. ®

If you’re someone who always ends up having to shell out extra money for your monthlycell phone bill because 1,000 anytime minutes just isn’t enough, there’s a solution for you (and, don’t worry, it does not involve talking less). VoIP (voice over internet protocol) phone systems no longer only pertains to the world voip business phone systems, and its advantages have now become available for the iPhone. If you’re familiar with VoIP phones, then you already know how cost-effective they can be for those who have to make frequent long-distance phone calls. Such savings can now be applied to cell phone use, and it is estimated by one company that offers VoIP for iPhones that people may be able to save up to 80% by using a VoIP application on their cell phone (Mobile Dev & Design).The iPhone has taken the capabilities of small business phone systems to a whole new level. Using the technology of a VoIP phone system (using Internet protocol to send and receive calls), users can now place long-distance or even international calls without having to worry about the charges. Internet phone systems, such as VoIP, are a much cheaper alternative to sending calls on your iPhone the traditional way – using your minutes.VoIP phone system companies now offer applications you can download to your iPhone which will give it the capabilities of ip phone systems. There are many applications available, however, some are more favored over others. Here are our favorites:has been given high ratings by such publications as The Times, The New York Times,and Stuffmagazine. This application is favored, in particular, because it allows users to search their iPhone’s contact list. In addition, calls are very clear, and can be made and received without delay.allows you to stay in touch with contacts on multiple networks, such as Skype, AIM, and MSN. iCall can be completely integrated with your iPhone, and works with a Wi-Fi connection. If you are using Wi-Fi and receive a call, you can easily switch over to your iCall application and save your minutes. Papaya and PennyTel are also VoIP applications for your iPhone.You also have the option of using web-based VoIP applications (which is kind of like using a hosted VoIP system in your office). Instead of downloading the application to your iPhone, you can simply log-in to your account online. JAJAH is one of the top web-applications, and looks like your iPhone’s dialing pad. Talkety, Raketu, and iPhoneGnome are also web-based.RingFree was one of the first VoIP services for your iPhone, and allows you to make calls using any VoIP service provider you choose. This application also allows you to make calls through an office phone system or virtual pbx.Now that you can use VoIP technology with your iPhone, ‘unlimited’ minutes has a whole new meaning. VoIP business phone systems have the capabilities to be even more mobile. The iPhone has taken softphone technology to the next level, allowing calls to be placed all over the world without having to pay the high cost. This is great for business travelers who need to be able to stay in-touch with co-workers or loved ones.Now you have more money for important things, like downloading the latest hit song to be your ringtone.

We all worry about personal safety. Chances are you have some form of self-defense on hand, just in case something happens. However, in the heat of the moment, are you really going to have it in hand and ready for use?The Yellow Jacket was created by a man who was attacked in his home. While he had firearms and a Tazer nearby, none of these items were within his grasp, which is what made him think about weaponizing his phone. Yellow Jacket is an iPhone case that comes equipped with a 650K volt stun gun, and is also capable of giving your phone an additional 20 hours of battery life. Not only can this save you from an attacker, but will also make sure your phone doesn’t die near the end of the day when you may actually need it. If you jump on this project now, it will only cost you $85, otherwise you’ll be looking at about $100.

The first day of the annual Pwn2Own contest in which security researchers can win cash and hardware if they successfully compromise machines using zero-day exploits is finished. Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7, Firefox 3 on Windows 7, Safari 4 on Mac OS X 10.6, and iPhone OS 3 were all compromised during the competition. Google's Chrome was the only browser left standing—and in fact, was completely untested. None of the researchers at the competition even tried to attack Chrome.So far, little is known about the successful exploits. Until vendors have been informed of the flaws and those flaws have been patched, details will not be made public.The iPhone was not successfully hacked in 2009's competition, but was predicted to fall this year, and those predictions have come true. A zero-day Safari flaw was used to gain access to text messages stored on the device by Vincenzo Iozzo from German security firm Zynamics and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg. Notable in the exploit was that it bypassed both iPhone's Data Execution Protection as well as its requirements that all code be signed.A little more is known about the IE8 exploit, including an (abridged) video of the browser being taken down. The successful researcher, Peter Vreugdenhil, has published a rough outline of the techniques used to bypass IE8's DEP and ASLR protections.The Safari hack came from Charlie Miller; this makes three years in a row now that Miller has pwned—and hence owned—a Mac at pwn2own. Thus far, nothing further about either this exploit or the Firefox one appears to have been published.Neither the iPhone exploit nor the IE8 exploit managed to escape the OS-supplied sandboxes that protect these platforms. Without escaping the sandboxes, the impact that flaws can have is reduced, preventing, for example, writing to hard disk (and hence, preventing installation of malware). Nonetheless, read-only access is still valuable for data theft.It is this sandboxing that might explain why Google's Chrome was untouched; no researcher even attempted to attack it. It is certainly not the case that Chrome has no security flaws—a couple of days before the Pwn2Own draw was made to decide who got to attack which machine and in what order, Google published an update to Chrome that fixed a range of security flaws, some of which were deemed to be high-risk. Google's sandboxing shouldn't be impenetrable, but it is sufficient to make the standard harmless exploit payload—starting up Windows calculator—harder to do.

People identifying themselves as representing Apple last week visited and sought permission to search the Silicon Valley address of the college-age man who came into possession of a next-generation iPhone prototype, according to a person involved with the find.“Someone came to [the finder's] house and knocked on his door,” the source told Wired.com, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is under investigation by the police. A roommate answered, but wouldn’t let them in.Apple’s vaunted wall of secrecy was smashed wide open when one of its developers lost a next-generation iPhone prototype sometime in March at a bar in Redwood City, California. Another bar patron took the phone home and, having failed to find the owner, gave tech news site Gizmodo exclusive access to the device in exchange for $5,000. Gizmodo eventually returned the phone to Apple, but not before it published numerous photos and details.San Mateo County police are now investigating, and they seized computers from Gizmodo writer Jason Chen’s home last week under a search warrant that Gizmodo is challenging as unlawful. Police have also identified and interviewed the man who took the phone from the bar, the reportedTuesday.News of Apple’s lost iPhone prototype hit the web like a bombshell, but it was apparently an open secret for weeks amongst the finder’s roommates and neighbors, where the device was shown around mostly as a curiosity. According to the source, who has direct knowledge of the Gizmodo transaction, the group of friends suspected this might be Apple’s new phone, but no one knew for sure.“There was no effort to keep it secret,” the source said. “There were a bunch of people who knew.”The finder attempted to notify Apple and find the owner of the device but failed, even going so far as to search alphabetically through Facebook, the source said. Thoughts then turned to contacting the press about the device to confirm its authenticity and help locate the owner, but early attempts to drum up interest went unanswered. After a few days with no response, the finder expanded the search.“The idea wasn’t to find out who was going to pay the most, it was, Who’s going to confirm this?” the source said.The finder at one point attempted to restore the phone by connecting it to a roommate’s Apple computer, but was unsuccessful.News accounts depicting the $5,000 payment as a “sale” are incorrect, this person said. Rather, the agreement with Gizmodo was for exclusivity only. “It was made very explicit that Gizmodo was to help the finder return the phone to its rightful owner or give it back,” this person said. “Gizmodo said they could help restore the phone.”Wired.com received an e-mail March 28 offering access to the device, but did not follow up on the exchange after the tipster made a thinly veiled request for money.

Hate going into AT&T stores and interacting with real humans? Worry not, as unlocking your AT&T iPhone is turning out to be a simpler process than expected for some users. The process can still be performed in-store by AT&T personnel, but it can also be done at home with the help of AT&T chat, Apple, and iTunes.We reported on Friday that AT&T would begin unlocking iPhones for qualified customers beginning Sunday, April 8. That was yesterday, and readers have begun reporting back with their experiences. As it turns out, all you really need is an active Internet connection and your iPhone's IMEI number to get started (you can get it from your iPhone under Settings > General > About). After logging into AT&T's website with your account credentials, you can then bring up AT&T's Wireless Support Chat where you can request your device be unlocked.As long as you meet the criteria—your phone isn't associated with an active-term commitment, you're out of contract, and your account is in good standing—AT&T will likely approve the request. But then it comes down to Apple, which has to push your unlock code to your e-mail address before you can proceed (this happens within 72 hours, but many users have said it took an hour or less). Once you receive the code, you must perform a backup and restore of the device through iTunes while tethered to a computer.As with most processes that are user-facing, the unlock process doesn't always work smoothly. AT&T's own documentation on the process points to this Apple support document on troubleshooting unlock issues, though there are a number of forum threads dedicated to discussing the nuances of performing the unlock procedure as well. Do you have any extra tips to offer for those who have yet to go through the process?Update: We have begun hearing that AT&T is making users call to initiate the unlock process instead of using the website chat feature. Still less effort than going into a retail outlet, but human interaction is somewhat required.
