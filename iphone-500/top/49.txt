This is weird. Touching the lower left corner of the iPhone 4 consistently drops calls. I've been testing this all night and here's a replication on video. The test was performed four times, but it could have been 40. Whether the palm of the and, should, neck, or any body part results in quickly dropping the call. This does not appear to affect the iPhone 3GS, which was tested with the iPhone 4.
