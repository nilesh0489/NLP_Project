Well, well, would you looky here? Seems like that super-exclusive iPhone leak that Gizmodo and Engadget were involved in has repeated itself in Vietnam.

Engadget reported earlier this morning about the leak, and noticed that the phone is slightly different from the one seen during Gizgate, in that the screws on the bottom of the phone are no longer present.

Aside from that, there are few other differences. The model is still pre-production — you can see little XXX placeholders on the body — so it may still change before launch, but the front-facing camera looks to be a pretty sure thing.

Pro tip: the source link has some awesome commentary on the leak, courtesy of Google Translate. It also has more photos.
