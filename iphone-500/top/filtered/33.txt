Ok, yes.. This was done recently. But, a LOT of people didn't get in on it fast enough, so, they didn't get referrals. Think of this as Dropbox referrals, part 2. It's your second chance to get 8GB of extra Dropbox space.

Please choose a random code from below.

Remember.. Remove your code when you've reached your limit.

Edit: In case you don't know.. If you sign up without a referral code, you only start with 2GB. If you USE a referral code, you start with 2.25GB. So, any way you slice it, you come out ahead. :)

Also.. Dropbox rocks. They use Amazon S3 to securely store your files and synchronize them between as many computers/iPhones/etc as you want.

Edit 2: One last thing.. In order for this to work, we need up-votes. Yeah, it's lame. But.. This is a self.reddit. So, I don't benefit from karma. SO.. upvote, sign up, post YOUR referral link and we can all prosper!

Edit 3: You can get an additional 250MB just for completing the Getting Started tutorial.
