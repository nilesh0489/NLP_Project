I'm looking to start to learn how to do some computer programming. It's a skill I've always wanted to have, but never found the time to do so. Fortunately, I will now have the time. I was wondering if there was a language that could expected to be useful for quite sometime? I want to learn C++ but i am having reservations that it will become like COBOL and my time and effort will be wasted. Anybody have some suggestions?

Edit: Someone asked for more specific goals.

I'd like to be able to do Iphone or Android apps, but at the same time have the language be useful for normal personal computer programming.
