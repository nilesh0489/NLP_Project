Nissan isn?t the first name most associate with the cutting edge of gadget case technology, but their self-healing Scratch Shield iPhone case has the potential to be a revolutionary product in an already oversaturated market. The technology behind the ?self-repairing? case technology isn?t new, it?s been in use on several Nissan and Infiniti car models since 2005. The collaborative effort between the University of Tokyo and Advanced Soft Materials INC consists of an ?outer ?paint? made from polyrotaxane, which means that when damage occurs to the coating in the form of a fine scratch, the chemical structure is able to react to change back to its original shape and fill the gap ? ?healing? the blemish? according to Nissan. Nissan soft-launched the case over the weekend at an automotive event held in Dubai. Nissan handed a number of cases out to customers and journalists for beta testing and announced that if the demand was strong enough they would consider mass producing the cases for a release to the general public. Hopefully the beta testing creates a strong buzz, but that all depends on how well the self-healing feature of case works in real world use.The pockets of gadget owners can be unforgiving dungeons capable of scratching the toughest reinforced screens, and cases. However, if the underlying technology of Nissan?s cases has been used on cars for the last five years, I?m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the material's ability to withstand consumers' pockets.
