You’ve seen the demos, we’ve gotten the approvals and now Spotify is mobile.

Today we’re really excited to announce that Spotify is available to our premium subscribers for the iPhone, iPod Touch and Android platforms. The Spotify app is downloadable in both Apple’s App Store and the Android Market.

We’ve worked hard to bring you the same great Spotify experience you’re already familiar with to your phone. The mobile apps will allow you to take the entire Spotify catalogue and put it in your pocket. You can use our ‘offline mode’ to make playlists available at all times, even when no connection is available. Perfect for that ride on the tube or long flight across the Atlantic.

Launching these apps is our first step at going mobile and we’d like to thank all the people who worked hard on making this happen as well as all the partners involved in the process.

We’ve set up a mobile section with more details and we look forward to hearing your thoughts. We know that you’ve been eagerly awaiting this launch and we appreciate the patience – now go out and get that app!
