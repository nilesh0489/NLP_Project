the dreaded words 'No Service' plague my iPhone's (beautiful) screen.

i decide to take the SIM card out and place it into my eight-year-old Nokia 6100. i turn it on. and now i see 'O2 - UK' and a full 7 bars! i place a call. i hear it ringing. my friend answers. we have our chat. all is well. i hang up and, apart from the handset getting slightly warm, i'm happy.

i don't know about you but I want my phone to be able to place calls first and foremost. everything else is secondary.

so is my phone faulty or has technology really gone backwards at Apple? how would I convince them to give me a new phone or a refund? your thoughts would be appreciated.

EDIT: I have tried switching 3G both on and off. I leave things like Push, Wifi, Bluetooth, Notifications, etc all off. I find it has bad reception generally whenever I go indoors and, even when I leave a building or come out of the underground, it takes a while for it to find a signal.
