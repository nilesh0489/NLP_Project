Responding to a string of complaints, Apple said that the error overstated the phone's signal strength, causing it to appear to lose more reception than it actually does when gripped a certain way.

Angry owners said that when they grip it via its lower left-hand corner, the phone drops several bars of signal.

"We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising," the company wrote in a letter.

"Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength."

Apple's CEO Steve Jobs last week told people complaining about the issue to simply hold their phone a different way.

Earlier this week, the company stated that "gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas".

It now says the combination of the effect of gripping the phone, plus the error in the way signal is displayed on the iPhone 4, is what is causing some users to report a drop of several bars.

"Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars.

"Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place," Apple said Friday.

The company said that it wouldl issue a software update within a few weeks to fix the issue, adding: "We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same - the iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped."

Several users have filed lawsuits over the reception issue.
