Google launched its first-ever Gmail app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch on Wednesday, but was forced to yank it from Apple's App Store within minutes due to a bug, Computerworld reported.

"Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS. Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app," Matthew Izatt, a Google product manager, wrote on the company's Gmail blog. "We’ve removed the app while we correct the problem, and we’re working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who’s already installed the app can continue to use it."

According to Computerworld, "scores" of users who downloaded the app were complaining on Twitter that they received a "Notification Error" message upon launching the app. 

"Googla culpa!" David Girouard, Google's vice president of apps, Tweeted on Wednesday, according to Computerworld. "Sorry, but we pushed a bad version of our iOS app for Gmail. More info shortly - we're working on it."

Before the app was yanked, Izatt had written a blog post touting the new app and saying it was "fast, efficient and take[s] full advantage of the touchscreen and notification capabilities of your device."

Meanwhile, Google has also been rolling out a new look for its regular Gmail service. On Tuesday, the company wrote a blog post giving an "in-depth" look at the new design, along with a video:

On Wednesday, as people got a chance to experience the changes from themselves, many have, perhaps predictably, shared their feelings on Twitter. Here's a sample of what people are saying:
