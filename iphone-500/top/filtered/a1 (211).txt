We all worry about personal safety. Chances are you have some form of self-defense on hand, just in case something happens. However, in the heat of the moment, are you really going to have it in hand and ready for use?

The Yellow Jacket was created by a man who was attacked in his home. While he had firearms and a Tazer nearby, none of these items were within his grasp, which is what made him think about weaponizing his phone. Yellow Jacket is an iPhone case that comes equipped with a 650K volt stun gun, and is also capable of giving your phone an additional 20 hours of battery life. Not only can this save you from an attacker, but will also make sure your phone doesn’t die near the end of the day when you may actually need it. If you jump on this project now, it will only cost you $85, otherwise you’ll be looking at about $100.
