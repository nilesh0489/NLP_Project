The overwhelming success of Apple’s iPhone 4S has finally hit a lull. Since its launch last October, the device has managed to hold on to the title of top selling device in the United States for 10 months before finally being dethroned by the Samsung Galaxy S III last month.

According to analyst Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity, monthly channel checks have confirmed that the Galaxy S III is the top selling device at T-Mobile (who doesn’t carry the iPhone 4S), Sprint and Verizon. The iPhone remained the number one device at AT&T, but the S III’s success at the other three largest carriers in the nation is enough to secure the number one spot.

The S III wasn’t the only Android device to do well, it’s worth noting that the number two top selling device at Verizon was the Droid RAZR MAXX, and every carrier that sells an HTC One series device has it in their top three.

Now that the Galaxy S III has become the top selling device in the nation, can it hold on? Apple, Motorola, HTC, LG, Nokia and even Samsung have new devices slated to hit the market before the end of the year. Still, I’d venture to guess the S III is more than capable of keeping up with whatever hits shelves by the holiday season.
