iPhones running iOS 4.0 or higher use very strong encryption to protect your data. But somebody just broke it.

All iOS devices have 256-bit encryption, and the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 additionally have built-in chips for hardware-based protection. But TheNextWeb reports that a team at Russian forensics firm Elcomsoft figured out a way to make your iPhone spill all its secrets — encryption or no encryption. The resulting data dumps can then be easily analyzed with common forensics software.

There is a catch which'll make you breathe a sigh of relief though. Elcomsoft's encryption cracking method only works long as there's physical access to your actual iPhone — not just the encrypted software backups on your computer:

Decryption is not possible without having access to the actual device because [Elcomsoft needs] to obtain the encryption keys that are stored in (or computed by) the device and are not dumped or stored during typical physical acquisition.

Whew! So assuming that you always check the “Encrypt iPhone backups” box in iTunes and keep your iPhone safely out of the hands of anyone with malicious intent, why should you care about this news? Because it's a little reminder that you need to be aware of the data which can be coaxed off your lost or stolen mobile device under the right circumstances. Follow the advice of good ol' Mad-Eye Moody, and stay "always vigilant!"
