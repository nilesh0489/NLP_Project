Just an hour after pre-orders for the iPhone 5 went live Apple Store shipping estimates for new pre-orders have already slipped to two weeks in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, and Australia. Once transit times are accounted for, users pre-ordering now may not receive their iPhones until nearly two weeks after the official launch date of September 21. Customers may still be able to receive launch-day delivery by ordering through their carriers. AT&T Verizon , and Sprint are listing 9/21 delivery dates at the time of this posting -- but those dates may not immediately reflect available stock. Customers may also still purchase the iPhone 5 on September 21st by going to a retail location. Apple is opening retail stores at 8 a.m. that day for the launch. Verizon, AT&T and Sprint stores are likely to have availability of the iPhone 5 as well on that day. Last year, it took about 22 hours to sell out of the pre-order launch day stock for the iPhone 4S.
