Many iPhone users arrived at work an hour late this morning after a glitch caused their smartphone's alarm to malfunction.

In the latest clock woe to strike the Apple device, some phones rang their alert an hour late, while others were an hour early and many didn't ring at all.

Users who missed appointments took to Twitter and other blogging sites to vent their frustration.

One person who had an unexpected lie-in Tweeted: 'It was set for 8 but went off at 7 I then set it for 9 and it went off at 9'.

The glitch is thought to have been caused by the change to British Summer Time in the early hours of Sunday morning.

But for all of its fancy features, the iPhone has had trouble telling the time of late, particularly when the clocks go back or forward an hour.

A clock malfunction prevented alarms from sounding for the first three days of the New Year, leading to complaints from users that they had missed flights or were late to arrive at work.

The devices also struggled to adjust to the end of U.S. daylight savings time in November.

One possible solution is to shut down and restart the phone or switch it to 'airplane mode' and then back again - advice that is too little, too late for those who slept in.

Apple was embroiled in publicity problems in July last year after the launch of the iPhone 4, when reports about bad reception snowballed and forced the company to call a news conference to address the issue, dubbed 'antennagate'.

This had no visible impact on Apple's sales as the company sold more than 14million iPhones in the quarter ending last September, more than ever before.

Apple reached another milestone earlier this month when it sold between 500,000 and a million iPad 2 tablet computers in the U.S. alone.

People across America queued for hours to become one of the first to buy the must-have gadget.

The pattern was repeated in the UK on Friday when the iPad 2 went on sale here. It was sold out by lunchtime on Saturday.
