FRUIT THEMED FIRM Apple's Iphone and Ipad could be banned in Germany after Motorola won a temporary injunction in the Mannheim Regional Court.

The case, which relates to Motorola's wireless technology patents, represents a huge loss for Apple in its tit for tat patent battles taking place around the world.

However, in typical fashion, Apple immediately said it would appeal the ruling. It said, "We're going to appeal the court's ruling right away. Holiday shoppers in Germany should have no problem finding the iPad or iPhone they want."

According to patent gadfly Florian Mueller, the ruling includes an injunction that is preliminarily enforceable against Ireland-based Apple Sales International in exchange for a €100mn (£85.4mn or $134m) bond unless Apple wins a stay.

He said on his blog, "Apple is certainly going to appeal this ruling to the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court and to request a stay for the duration of the appellate proceedings. Such a suspension may or may not be granted."

Apple suffered another loss today when an Australian court lifted a ban on the Samsung Galaxy Tab in Australia. µ
