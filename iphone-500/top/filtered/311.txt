For some time now, rumors of the GPhone (or Google phone) have been circulating around the web.  While it didn't make a whole lot of sense that Google was going to get into the hardware business, especially the highly competitive handset business, it seemed reasonable that Google had an interest in the handheld market for obvious reasons, not the least of which is the huge potential in search.  Though, as we came to find out, it wasn't so much the hardware but the "platform" that Google was interested in.  Tomorrow (9/23) will bring a lot more clarity to Google's play in the handset business, according to Time , as the first ever Google Andriod operating system-based handset is set for retail availability with T-Mobile customers.  The T-Mobile Dream is go for launch.

The sweetest part of the Dream is the Android Market — Google's answer to the Apple App Store. Whereas many Apple apps cost money (typically anywhere from $.99 to $9.99), at launch all Android Market apps will be free. That includes BreadCrumbz, a picture-based navigation program that doesn't just give you a drawing of your route, but also includes real-world photos to keep you on track. Another interesting app, TuneWiki, is a tricked-out music player that encourages mobile karaoke, by synchronizing written lyrics onscreen to the song's YouTube video.Let's see, open source, major player support in key enabling technologies like search and navigation, freeware utilities to the public --  Apple, you can be afraid now, very afraid.



This video of the Android concept was published a little less than a year ago and it's still pretty impressive.  Now if they could just find a real service carrier, we'd be in business.
