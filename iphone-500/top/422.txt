Apple is, according to a "Korean Mole", readying OLED-screened iPhones to be sold this year. The rumor comes via Reg Hardware, which points out that:

Normally such small rumors would be filed for later use, but with the recent announcement of the 3.0 iPhone OS and the summer fast approaching (The next iPhone – if Apple follows the pattern of recent years – should be announced at the end of June), we’ve been wondering just what Apple might add to the next iteration of the hardware.

Last year, it was obvious. The iPhone lacked both a 3G radio and GPS. Those were added, along with a slimmer body. This year, there is no clear upgrade path. Perhaps a better camera with a few more pixels (but please, not too many) and maybe video capability. Otherwise, what is there to add?

An OLED screen would make sense. It uses less power, looks better and runs brighter, so this rumor has a ring of the truth about it. Otherwise, we expect little more than some re-styling, a faster processor and more memory. Think about it. The iPhone and the iPod Touch are more of a computing platform than phones or iPods. Apple only offers major redesigns of its computers every few years, with incremental, internal upgrades in between. We’d say the iPhone will go the same way.
