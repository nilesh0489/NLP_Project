One of the niftier features of the Palm Pre is its Touchstone inductive charger, which recharges your phone wirelessly while holding it in place magnetically.  No slots, no contacts, no muss, no fuss.  What could be better? more pics after the fold

How about making it mobile?

As you can see from the attached photos, a good friend of iSmashPhone.com did just that in his BMW.  After mounting a Touchstone on the center console, he ran a Sprint car charger with a mini-USB connector from the Touchstone to the car’s electrical system.  (The cigarette lighter will work just as well.)

Voila! No spiderweb of charging cables, no fumbling with plugs at stop lights, no fear a sudden hard turn will fling your phone into the back seat, and — most importantly of all — no more worries about your Pre’s battery dying while you’re closing that big business deal on I-95 South.

Bottom line: this is how allin-car phone chargers should work.
