SAN JOSE -- Apple released late Tuesday its best evidence that Samsung has copied its patents and trade dress, a 132-page Samsung report comparing its handsets to the iPhone.The report methodically compares the iPhone and Samsung's S1 handset across 126 specific features. A page is dedicated to each feature with each page showing side-by-side comparisons of how the iPhone and the S1 implement the feature.At the bottom of each page, the report makes recommendations for how Samsung could improve its handsets.
