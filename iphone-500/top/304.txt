UPDATE: I have run out of promo codes, but really appreciate all the positive comments and support. If you have feedback, please feel free to email me at jacobu@gmail.com. I can only do some much QA testing on my own, and it's not until something gets into the hands of the masses that it can truly be torn apart :-D. I'll do my best to reply to all your messages and fix anything that needs fixing. I will release a bug fix version within a few days (+approval time, ~2-3 days), and will likely give out more free copies then. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.

So for the last 2 months, I've been cranking away on an app called Aetherspark. It's a file browser, storage, and transfer system. It lets you mount your iPad as a disk from any OS (via WebDAV), transfer files to it, and browse them on the device. You can also upload and browse files on your device with a web browser. It even lets you send files between devices (even without wifi). Yes, it's a bit like AirSharing, but the interface is significantly different, and it has file transfer capabilities. It's also cheaper.

Here are some demo videos Here's the app store link

I have 50 promo codes (most I can get per version) that I want to give out for a free download, so if you want one, please send me a private message and I'll give you one (if I haven't run out).

I'm not only looking to get the word out about it, I'm also looking for feedback (both suggestions and problems you have with it).

A slight caveat, the promo codes only work in the U.S. iTunes store. Nothing I can do about this unfortunately. :-(
