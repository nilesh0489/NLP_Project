Surprise, surprise, there is another patent battle going on. This time Apple and HTC are arguing over patents in the International Trade Commission. In this trial, HTC is claiming that Apple is infringing upon patents having to do with LTE technology, patents that were secured for the HTC Thunderbolt. They now say that these patents are used in the new iPad and will be used in the new iPhone.

ITC Judge Thomas Pender said the case might end up with an import ban unless Apple can invalidate the two patents in question, which he also said is not very easy. We just got a statement from Samsung last week saying they would sue over an LTE iPhone, is this going to give Android some wins in the court room?
