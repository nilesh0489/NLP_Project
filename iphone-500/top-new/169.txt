It's all kicking off: Apple has called an emergency press conference to address the controversy surrounding the iPhone 4 and its incredible shrinking phone signal.

iPhone 4 has been plagued with controversy since it first arrived in customers' hands, and owners quickly discovered those very hands broke their new £500 phone. It may be the dog and bone everyone and their gran has heard of, tweeted about, and featured in a hilarious webcomic, but it divides opinion like few other tech products -- and has even led to a share price nosedive.

Apple's official stance is that the reception issues are the result of a long-standing software glitch that displays the wrong number of signal bars. So far, Apple has refused to acknowledge the alleged hardware problems caused by wrapping the phone's two antennas around the outside of the phone.

Fortunately, someone has seen the funny side: Microsoft COO Kevin Turner joked at the MS Worldwide Partner Conference that "the iPhone 4 might be their Vista". The wag! Wasn't so blinkin' funny in 2005, Kev.
