A key feature of Unity is Dash, a single place to search for apps, documents, music, and other data on your computer. Starting with the latest release of Ubuntu, Dash is also starting to search the Internet for you. While some people find this convenient, others find it a violation of their privacy. Luckily, Ubuntu makes it easy to turn this off. Scroll down to "How to Disable Amazon Ads and Data Leaks" to learn how.The first thing you'll notice about the new Dash is that when you search for something, you not only see local files but also Amazon-affiliated advertisements for products. There has been a massive outcry of complaints from the Ubuntu community about this, as well as a bug reports, both serious ("Don't include remote searches in the home lens", "Direct data leaking to Amazon") and tongue in cheek ("grep -R doesn't automatically search amazon", "Spyware coverage incomplete - limited to Dash"). Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of Ubuntu, defended the decision to include Amazon ads in Dash: We are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Donâ€™t trust us? Erm, we have root. You do trust us with your data already. You trust us not to screw up on your machine with every update. You trust Debian, and you trust a large swathe of the open source community. And most importantly, you trust us to address it when, being human, we err.Technically, when you search for something in Dash, your computer makes a secure HTTPS connection to productsearch.ubuntu.com, sending along your search query and your IP address. If it returns Amazon products to display, your computer then insecurely loads the product images from Amazon's server over HTTP. This means that a passive eavesdropper, such as someone sharing a wireless network with you, will be able to get a good idea of what you're searching for on your own computer based on Amazon product images.It's a major privacy problem if you can't find things on your own computer without broadcasting what you're looking for to the world. You could be searching for the latest version of your rÃ©sumÃ© at work because you're considering leaving your job; you could be searching for a domestic abuse hotline PDF you downloaded, or legal documents about filing for divorce; maybe you're looking for documents with file names that will gave away trade secrets or activism plans; or you could be searching for a file in your own local porn collection. There are many reasons why you wouldn't want any of these search queries to leave your computer.The new version of Dash that comes with Ubuntu 12.10 introduces more than just Amazon ads. It includes a new legal notice that you can see by clicking the "i" in the corner of Dash that states that by using Dash, you automatically agree to send your search term and IP address to a number of third parties. Unless you have opted out, we will also send your keystrokes as a search term to productsearch.ubuntu.com and selected third parties so that we may complement your search results with online search results from such third parties including: Facebook, Twitter, BBC and Amazon. Canonical and these selected third parties will collect your search terms and use them to provide you with search results while using Ubuntu.Ubuntu's Third Party Privacy Policies page lists all of the third parties that they may send your search term and IP address to, and states: "For information on how our selected third parties may use your information, please see their privacy policies." In other words, once they give your data away, it's no longer their problem.Canonical is not clear about which third parties it sends data to and when, but it appears that many of these third parties only get searched in certain circumstances. Ubuntu's new Online Accounts feature lets you authorize Ubuntu to use your accounts from Facebook, Twitter, Google, Flickr and other services for Ubuntu apps. Dash will likely search these services for photos, documents, and other content only after you've authorized Ubuntu to use them.Canonical has been listening to feedback from Ubuntu users and they are working on improvements to Dash, such as loading Amazon images over HTTPS to prevent eavesdroppers from learning what users search for, and NSFW filters so that pornography doesn't appear in Dash. These changes are great, but it doesn't change the fact that users' search queries automatically get sent to third party companies without giving users a chance to opt-in.Even loading Amazon product images over HTTPS instead of HTTP, the fact that they are loaded directly from Amazon's servers instead of from Canonical's means that Amazon has the ability to correlate search queries with IP addresses. One way to fix this would be if Canonical proxied all third party images and other content for Ubuntu users.How to Disable Amazon Ads and Data LeaksYou can uninstall Dash's Amazon integration by removing the package called unity-lens-shopping from your computer. If you are currently using Ubuntu 12.10, you can click here to open unity-lens-shopping in Ubuntu Software Center, and then click the "Remove" button on the right. You can also uninstall it by opening the Terminal app and typing:sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shoppingFinally, if you don't like the direction that Unity is going but you still like the Ubuntu operating system, you can switch to a different desktop environment altogether such as GNOME 3, KDE, or Cinnamon.You can get GNOME 3 by installing the package called gnome-shell. You can get KDE by installing the package called kde-full. And you can get Cinnamon by adding the Cinnamon PPA to your repositories and then installing the package called cinnamon. Once you have installed a new desktop environment, you can choose which one you want to use from your login screen. Click the Ubuntu logo next to your username to change your desktop environment.What EFF Wants From UbuntuUbuntu is the third most popular desktop operating system, and it's the most popular free software one. Many of EFF's employees run Ubuntu on their own computers. Here is what we would like to see from future versions of Ubuntu.Disable "Include online search results" by default. Users should be able to install Ubuntu and immediately start using it without having to worry about leaking search queries or sending potentially private information to third party companies. Since many users might find this feature useful, consider displaying a dialog the first time a user logs in that asks if they would like to opt-in.Explain in detail what you do with search queries and IP addresses, how long you store them, and in what circumstances you give them to third parties.Make the Search Results tab of the Privacy settings let users toggle on and off specific online search results. Some users might want Amazon products in their search results, but never anything from Facebook.We love that Ubuntu is bold enough to break new ground and compete directly with the large proprietary operating systems, but please make sure that you respect your users' privacy and security while you're doing it. Windows and Mac users are used to having their data sent to third parties without their express consent by software companies that are trying to maximize profits for their shareholders. Let's make sure Ubuntu, like the GNU/Linux operating system at its heart, remains an exception to this.Last Thursday, Microsoft held its formal shindig in honor of the arrival of Windows 8 and Surface in New York. Today, itâ€™s another coast, another Microsoft event and another version of Windows â€” namely Windows Phone 8, which the company launched at a San Francisco press conference this morning.Over the weekend, I tried an HTC Windows Phone 8X, one of the new Windows Phone 8 handsets. (The new software wonâ€™t be available as an upgrade for Windows Phone 7.5 devices, so the only way to get it will be to buy a new phone.) I didnâ€™t have enough time to give the 8X a truly thorough workout, and the review unit supplied by HTC is an international model that doesnâ€™t support LTE in the U.S.; I just used it on wi-fi, and therefore didnâ€™t try making phone calls. So this story isnâ€™t a review.That said, my early impressions of the phone are positive: Itâ€™s got a tapered soft-touch polycarbonate case which feels good in the hand and doesnâ€™t look like a sad iPhone knockoff. At 4.3â€³, the screen is big enough to feel roomy, and small enough that the phone isnâ€™t a behemoth, and the cameras (including a wide-angle front one) seem solid. Along with its cousin the 8S, this is also the first Windows Phone with Beats audio, which boosts bass during headphone listening in a way that adds a jolt of energy to certain types of music.Nice though the 8X hardware is, this phone, like all smartphones, is defined by its operating system. While 2010â€²s Windows Phone 7 was good; last yearâ€™s Windows Phone 7.5 was really good. And Windows Phone 8, from my brief time with it, seems to be really, really good.The new version is a substantial one in terms of new features, but the biggest change is one of fundamental technology: Windows Phone 8 is now based on the same core as Windows 8, rather than Windows Mobile, the aging junior-sized platform thatâ€™s been the basis of all previous versions of Windows for phones. Microsoft says that moving on up to full-strength Windows will permit the operating system to do a better job of supporting more powerful hardware, and will allow Windows developers to more easily write apps which run on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.Iâ€™m not going to step through all the new features in Windows Phone, but theyâ€™re many and varied, from a new mapping application based on Nokiaâ€™s mapping data to â€œlensâ€? add-ins which add additional features to the camera app to better voice input.Microsoft is continuing its emphasis on people-centric stuff with even more social-networking capabilities, such as the ability to group people into â€œRooms.â€? Itâ€™s added a feature called Kidâ€™s Corner which lets you hand over your phone to your children, content that theyâ€™ll only be able to get at the apps and content you permit. And itâ€™s introduced Data Sense, a technology which compresses web pages to help you stay within your data planâ€™s limits. (Verizon will be the first carrier to support it.) It all adds up to an impressive piece of work.Normally, the tech industry is a meritocracy: Impressive pieces of work tend to do well. But if thereâ€™s one thing weâ€™ve learned from Windows Phone to date, itâ€™s that impressive products sometimes fail to take off.With mobile phones, the alchemy of success is particularly complex. An operating system such as Windows Phone has four constituencies: consumers, developers, manufacturers and carriers. Itâ€™s tough for an operating-system company to come up with something compelling for any one of these groups unless it gets all of them excited, all at once. And with the iPhone and Android so deeply entrenched in their own ways, it hasnâ€™t been entirely clear whether the market has room for a strong number three mobile platform.So far, Windows Phone is stuck as an also-ran. While Gartner says that Windows Phone shipments grew by more than 130 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, that only got the platform to a measly 2.7 percent of the market share, compared to 64.1 percent for Android and 18.8 percent for iOS.For Windows Phone to thrive, it needs cool apps â€” both the major cool apps available elsewhere, and some cool apps which are its alone. It needs dynamite phones. And as much as anything else, it needs the salespeople at phone stores to do a good job of selling the platformâ€™s virtues, even though itâ€™s probably much easier to sell the known quantities that are the iPhone and Android.Microsoft is making progress on the cool-app front: At this morningâ€™s event, Windows Phone honcho Joe Belfiore says that Windows Phone 8 will get 46 of the top 50 apps, including Pandora, until now the poster child for Windows Phone unavailability. (He didnâ€™t mention the four which arenâ€™t on their way, but Instagram and Flipboard leap to mind as iOS/Android all-stars that remain no-shows on Windows Phone.) The new phones from Nokia, HTC and Samsung look promising, too.As for whether the carriers will do a good job of getting consumers interested in Windows Phone 8, I chatted with Microsoft Corporate VP Terry Myerson after the event, and he said that the companyâ€™s relationship with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon has never been better. (Sprint, however, hasnâ€™t announced any plans to release Windows Phone 8 devices.)Then thereâ€™s the great big wild card known as Windows 8. Until now, Microsoftâ€™s Metro Modern interface, as clever as it is, has been an outlier â€” a radical departure from the one you encounter on all your other computing devices. Now that both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 have their own incarnations of the Modern look, Windows Phone could go from feeling a tad foreign to being utterly mainstream.Or, if consumers donâ€™t buy into Windows 8â€²s brave new world, Windows Phone 8 could get caught in the backlash. Itâ€™s just hard to know.Me, Iâ€™m going to give it a try. As soon as I press Publish on this post, Iâ€™m going to take the U.S. version of the 8X phone that I (and everyone else at the event) received and hotfoot it over to the nearest AT&T store. Iâ€™ll ask someone there to switch my account over from the Samsung Galaxy Nexus Iâ€™ve been using for the past few months to the 8X. For a few weeks, at least, Iâ€™ll be a Windows Phone 8 person â€” and Iâ€™ll let you know how it goes.The most obvious UI tweak in 8 â€” the one that users will immediately notice the first time they turn on their phone â€” is that the home screen is now more functional and flexible. Windows Phone 7 is noted for sacrificing precious real estate with a wide black bar on the right side of the home screen, but no more: version 8 spreads out, allowing the Live Tiles to occupy the entire width of the display. You can still get to your full list of apps the same way as before by swiping left (if you prefer to tap, the right arrow icon is still there â€” itâ€™s been moved to the bottom of the Live Tile stack).And speaking of Live Tiles, I think this is my single favorite change in Windows Phone 8: users can now choose from up to three sizes for each tile they pin to the home screen (some apps are limited to two). If you think of Windows Phoneâ€™s home screen as a grid four units wide and infinitely long, the available sizes are 1 x 1, 2 x 2, and 4 x 2; the latter two will be familiar to existing users, but the new 1 x 1 size is a great choice for app shortcuts that donâ€™t need a ton of space to show live information flowing from the app (I use one for my third-party Starbucks card app, for instance). Injecting 1 x 1 tiles throughout your home screen layout really gives it some flair and individuality; I think itâ€™s exactly what Microsoft needed to complete the look. Itâ€™s not a stretch to say that Windows Phone 8 has the best home screen â€” the perfect combination of flexibility, design, and simplicity â€” of any major platform right now.Microsoft has always suggested that meaningful personalization is a critical element of the Windows Phone proposition. Touchpoints like highlight color (which is deeply ingrained throughout the platform) and home screen configurability have always been important to the platform â€” things that let users show hints of individuality while still making sure you can always tell beyond a shadow of a doubt that youâ€™re definitely looking at a Windows Phone. To that end, the lock screen also gets some welcome improvements without losing its "Windows Phone-ness" â€” it still has the big time and date text across the bottom, for instance. Now, though, you can let third-party apps and services plug into it to cycle the background image, which is cooler than it sounds; take Bing, for instance, which is known for its killer imagery. Apps can also make status icons available to the lock screen, and you can choose up to five icon types to show at a time: Facebook messages, Xbox notifications, unread email, text messages, missed calls, and the like.Like the home and lock screens, Windows Phoneâ€™s soft keyboard is another element that users inevitably interact with on an almost constant basis, and that makes its design critical â€” particularly considering that it still (frustratingly) canâ€™t be swapped out for a third party keyboard in version 8. Youâ€™d think that Microsoft would look to the wild success of keyboard like SwiftKey and Swype on Android and admit that the benefits to users of opening up the input method to developers outweigh the risks, but no dice. Fortunately, Windows Phone has always had a fantastic keyboard, and this version is no exception; I felt as though it was lagging me on a couple occasions, but that may have been my imagination because I never had major input problems or uncorrected errors.In Windows Phone 8, the keyboard incorporates something from its Research division that it calls "Word Flow," which operates much like the phrase prediction technology in SwiftKey and the keyboard found in Android 4.1 â€” it can type entire sentences for you, word by word, by looking at what youâ€™ve typed so far. One interesting feature of Word Flow that Iâ€™ve not seen on other keyboards, though, is contextual correction: Microsoft says itâ€™ll actually analyze the sentence you write and make corrections based on context. The example they give is that if you type "come over fir dinner" itâ€™ll correct "fir" to "for," but Iâ€™m not convinced â€” I then tried typing "thatâ€™s a nice fir tree" and it still made the same correction.The loop you're trying to view is pushing more traffic to our server than it can handle.

Learn moreWASHINGTON - It is expected to be the mother of all cyber diplomatic battles.When delegates gather in Dubai in December for an obscure UN agency meeting, fighting is expected to be intense over proposals to rewrite global telecom rules to effectively give the United Nations control over the Internet.Russia, China and other countries back a move to place the Internet under the authority of the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency that sets technical standards for global phone calls.US officials say placing the Internet under UN control would undermine the freewheeling nature of cyberspace, which promotes open commerce and free expression, and could give a green light for some countries to crack down on dissidents.Observers say a number of authoritarian states will back the move, and that the major Western nations will oppose it, meaning the developing world could make a difference."The most likely outcome is a tie, and if that happens there won't be any dramatic changes, although that could change if the developing countries make a big push," said James Lewis, director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies."But there is a lot of discontent with how the Internet is governed and the US will have to deal with that at some point."Lewis said there was still an overwhelming perception that the US owns and manages the Internet. Opponents have a "powerful argument" to create a global authority to manage the Internet, Lewis said, but "we need to find some way to accommodate national laws in a way that doesn't sacrifice human rights."Terry Kramer, the special US envoy for the talks, has expressed Washington's position opposing proposals by Russia, China and others to expand the ITU's authority to regulate the Internet."The Internet has grown precisely because it has not been micro-managed or owned by any government or multinational organization," Kramer told a recent forum."There is no Internet central office. Its openness and decentralization are its strengths."The head of the ITU, Hamadoun Toure, said his agency has "the depth of experience that comes from being the world's longest established intergovernmental organization."Toure wrote in the British newspaper The Guardian that any change in regulation should "express the common will of ITU's major stakeholders" and "find win-win solutions that will act as a positive catalyst."But Harold Feld of the US-based non-government group Public Knowledge said any new rules could have devastating consequences."These proposals, from the Russian Federation and several Arab states, would for the first time explicitly embrace the concept that governments have a right to control online communications and disrupt Internet access services," Feld said on a blog post."This would reverse the trend of the last few years increasingly finding that such actions violate fundamental human rights."Paul Rohmeyer, who follows cybersecurity at the Stevens Institute of Technology, pointed to a "sense of anxiety" about the meeting in part because of a lack of transparency.He said it was unclear why the ITU is being considered for a role in the Internet."The ITU historically has been a standards-setting body and its roots are in the telecom industry. I'm not familiar with anything they've done that's had an impact on the Internet today," Rohmeyer told AFP.And the analyst noted that the significance of extending "governance" of the Internet to the ITU remains unclear.Some observers point out that the ITU hired a Russian security firm to investigate the Flame virus, which sparked concerns about the dangers in cyberspace and the need for better cybersecurity cooperation.Rohmeyer said it was unclear whether a conspiracy was at hand, but that "the suggestion that the Internet is a dangerous place could be used to justify greater controls."Observers are also troubled by a proposal by European telecom operators seeking to shift the cost of communication from the receiving party to the sender. This could mean huge costs for US Internet giants like Facebook and Google."This would create a new revenue stream for corrupt, autocratic regimes and raise the cost of accessing international websites and information on the Internet," said Eli Dourado of George Mason University.Milton Mueller, a professor of information studies at Syracuse University who specializes in Internet governance, said most of the concerns are being blown out of proportion.Mueller said the ITU "already recognizes the sovereign right of nations to restrict communications into and out of the country.""What gets lost in the confusion over content regulation is that the real motive of most of the reactionary governments is to protect themselves from economic competition caused by telecom liberalization and deregulation, of which the Internet is only one part," he said.Related: US Says It Will Oppose Major Revisions of Global Telecom RulesRelated Reading:Â 'Internet Kill Switch' - Is this Technically Feasible in the US?VMworld is about a month behind us now and Iâ€™ve had a little more time to noodle on the joint survey I did with virtualization management vendor Xangati. There was a tremendous amount of energy at VMworld and the show floor was one of the biggest and busiest Iâ€™ve seen in a long time. This might give one the impression that the VMware franchise is impenetrable, but the survey shows differently.Before I go through some of the data, remember the survey was answered by current VMware customers, so the data is likely to be skewed pro-VMware, which makes the data even more surprising. VMware has had a virtual (pun intended) monopoly on the market, but there does seem to be some chinks in the armor that could be exploited by another solution provider.The first question regarding VMware competition was "What are your plans for implementing Microsoft Hyper-V in your virtual infrastructure?" While 58.5% of the respondent base said they had "no plans," 19.6% said they were currently implementing Hyper-V in production and test and dev environments. Another 20.9% are currently evaluating functionality within Windows Server 2012 for potential future deployment. Considering the survey consisted of existing VMware customers, this is a surprising large number.How to address WAN jitter issues for real-time applicationsThe decision to bring Microsoft into the environment is being brought in by more of the "hands-on" individuals versus IT management. Of the respondents that are considering or using Hyper-V, 53.2% reported it was the technical team. Another 30.6% of the time it was the manager/director level was pushing for the hybrid environment. And only 16.2% said the VP or CIO level makes the decisions to create a hybrid Microsoft/VMware environment.In the survey, we tried to uncover why customers are looking to add Microsoft to their virtualization environment by asking, "what are the executive-level drivers that are pushing a hybrid VMware/Microsoft hypervisor model?" The most common answer (34.7%) was VMware's licensing and pricing. Another 26.2% chose "Perception that Microsoft functionality is now â€˜good enough.â€™" In some way, these are tied together. If one can get good enough functionality for a better price, why not look at it? Now, itâ€™s no secret that VMwareâ€™s vRam pricing scheme wasnâ€™t exactly a hit. The company moving away from vRam may change the minds of some potential defectors. Itâ€™s good to see that VMware listened to its customers and heard them with regard to pricing, and were willing to make the change.The second part of the above paragraph â€“ whether or not Hyper-V is "good enough" - seems to be widely believed. Responding to the question - "based upon what you know of Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 do you believe it can manage the performance of your infrastructure on par with vSphere?" - 52% of the companies said they did believe the technology was equivalent. Another 16.4% said they wanted different hypervisors for different applications. We didnâ€™t ask much detail around this but Iâ€™m assuming that thereâ€™s a perception that Microsoft applications might perform better on Hyper-V. Only 10.2% responded they were bringing Microsoft in for price leverage, meaning the desire to use Hyper-V seems real.VMware has been an early mover, which is an advantage when combined with a weak competitive landscape for the better part of a decade. As technically sound as Xen is, it doesnâ€™t have near the channel that Microsoft has. So from the survey results, it appears the VMware "free ride" is rapidly coming to an end. The timing of the pricing range was spot on. But watch your back VMware, because Microsoft is coming.Microsoft needs apps. The success of the new, touch-centric Start Screen of Windows 8 and Windows RT depends on building a thriving app ecosystem to compare with the iOS App Store or Google Play. But if one developer's experience is any indication, actually getting an app into the Windows Store is a lot harder than you might expect.Longtime Windows developer Jeffrey Harmon says he first submitted an app to the Windows Store on August 29 â€“ but it wasn't until this week that it was approved and made available to the public.Harmon doesn't fault the Windows 8 SDK. "For the most part, I think they have done a great job, as the tools, documentation and examples are excellent," he writes. "Where they really fall down though is in the last mile: app submission."Harmon says he first began developing his app, Memorylage, in December. He started work using the Windows 8 Developer Preview, then later updated his code for the Consumer Preview and the Release Preview.In the process, he attended both a Microsoft App Excellence workshop and a Hackathon event, winning Microsoft's "App X" contest both times. At the App Excellence event, Harmon and a Microsoft Field Engineer went over a 60-point checklist to ensure that his app met Redmond's design guidelines and was ready for submission to the Windows Store. All seemed well.No such luck, though. When Harmon finally submitted his app in August, he received a rejection notice a day later. Memorylage crashed, he was told, though the notice didn't specify when or how. He was told it had performance problems, but not what kind. He was told it failed a Direct 3D test, which seemed strange since it wasn't a 3D app and it only used standard controls. Furthermore, the notice said, his website wasn't finished.Needless to say, without more information, fixing all of the problems with Harmon's app proved difficult â€“ particularly since Memorylage passed all of the Windows App Certification Kit tests on his own computer.As he worked to narrow down the issues, Harmon engaged at least six different Microsoft employees, both online and over the phone, eventually including no less than Microsoft's Windows group president, Steven Sinofsky. In all, he exchanged 131 emails with Microsoft staffers, he says, but to no avail."I have given my app, and even my source code, to multiple people within Microsoft.Â To date, not a single one of them has been able to cause it to crash, or fail a single test," Harmon wrote earlier this week. "Every issue that I have figured out, I found on my own, but the store still fails it. How do you debug that?"When El Reg reached out to Microsoft for comment, a spokesperson pointed out that Harmon's appÂ is in fact now available in the Windows Store, adding, "We are committed to delivering a great experience for our developers."But although MemorylageÂ was eventually accepted, its journey from submission to approval took nearly two months. Harmon says the delay has cost him plenty, including marketing opportunities and first-mover advantage, to say nothing of time he could have spent improving his app instead of struggling to get it into the Store."I still think that Windows 8 is a great opportunity for developers, but as it stands, they are in for a world of hurt in trying to get through that last hurdle," Harmon writes. "As a long-time Windows developer, I really hope that changes soon." Â®Every sixty seconds, a tidal wave of unstructured data is produced, consumed, and archived.

Â Classic case of â€œInnovatorâ€™s Dilemmaâ€?. Amazing how managers donâ€™t pay attention to mega-trends and simply watch the train-wreck unfold. Â Handling disruptive business model change is never easy.Clearly we are not short on data. What we need are better big data platforms, paired with predictive and sentiment analytics, that allow us to correlate â€œcause and effectâ€? say transactions with social media mentions; Â positive buzz with ad campaigns; Â uplift Â in certain age groups by certain influencers and so on.Instead of learning which customers a company lost; it might be better to predict which customers a company might lose and present timely offers or products motivating customers to stay.I was recently in a Best Buy and had a interesting social experience. Â I used Red Laser to do real-time price compare but eventually decided that the 10% discount on a product is not a good tradeoff of my time.As I checked out, I asked about the return policy and was met with a hostile responseâ€¦.donâ€™t take anything back without a manufacturer defect. Â Itâ€™s interesting that while companies like Target are â€œprice matchingâ€? online competitors they are still not paying attention to the other aspects of the sale like easy (no questions) returns; unlimited return windows etc. The shopping experience is more than price!!!This â€œnew customer interaction modelâ€? example illustrates how much work is ahead of traditional firms as they transform their business model in the Mobile + Social world.In the new â€œMobile + Socialâ€? interaction paradigmâ€¦ the traditional firms â€“ banks, retailers, etc â€“ Â better figure out the future of stores (and brick and mortar) in the age of digital products, same-day delivery and mobile apps that tell you in real-time what is out there.This is definitely accelerating the â€œshowroomingâ€? phenom as traditional players become an expensive fronts for online retailers. Businessweek (October 28, 2012) had a great quote: â€œBest Buy pays for real-estate, sales people and cash registers and Amazon.com rings up the sale.â€? Showrooming put Borders out of business and brought Barnes & Noble to the brink.So this is for real â€” what are you going to do about it. Â Technology convergence (cloud, mobile, social) is the catalyst for a bigger disruption.A mounted laser that projects bike lane lines onto the street at night joins the ranks of lit-up safety gear for cyclists. The question is: Does it actually work?The XFire bike lane safety light was created by a Los Angeles based company with the goal of helping bike commuters stay safe. The patent-pending light costs about $40, contains five bright red LEDs, and projects two visible red laser lines on either side of the bike. It reminded me a little of the BLAZE device, which projects a bright green shared lane symbol on the road ahead of a cyclist.British blogger Trevor Ward recently took the XFire tail-light for a spin and described his experiences in the Guardian online. Although a dog walker was impressed by the lasers, a neighbor who followed Ward in her car said she didn't really notice the lines and didn't feel the need to give him more room.You might be wondering why I try the XFire out myself. The truth is I've already got some bright (and expensive) flashing bike lights, and they've made me realize that lights can only do so much.Many Colorado drivers don't care that my bike is lit front and back, or that I'm in a bike lane with reflective painted lines, or even that the crosswalk just automatically lit up to signal that they should stop for me. There have been a bunch close calls, and I was carefully following the rules.Better city planning could make more of a difference. Recently several main streets in my Denver neighborhood, which hasn't historically been the most bike-friendly area, were painted with shared lane symbols. Two bike shops have also opened up. Lasers are fun, but I'm looking forward to the day when drivers expect to see bikers everywhere.Although maintaining complete anonymity on the internet is very difficult, there are plenty of tools and alternative services out there that can help protect your personal data. Below weâ€™ve listed five of our favourite services and tools that are privacy conscious. Of course, using the below suggestions will not guarantee 100% protection from privacy intrusions, but theyâ€™re a good place to start!If you want to get out of the Google eco-system then the first thing youâ€™ll want is a search engine alternative. You can find big brand alternatives such as Bing and Excite, but DuckDuckGois one of the few search engines that takes user privacy seriously. DuckDuckGo promises that it wonâ€™t track users orÂ  employ filter bubbles â€“ tailoring your search results based on your account history. This anti-Google attitude has been gaining DuckDuckGo a great deal of publicity and the search engine recent broke the million visitors per day milestone. DuckDuckGo also offers a bunch of handy tools such as metric conversions, common calculations and stock price info.Ghostery is an add-on that originally launched on Mozillaâ€™s Firefox browser and is now available for Chrome, IE and Opera (as well as a standalone app for iOS). Along with DoNotTrack, Ghostery is one of the best privacy-orientated add-ons available for browsers. Ghostery essentially blocks tracking from ad-companies via cookie blocking and cookie protection. The add-on also gives you a list of all the ad networks, data companies and publishers tracking your browser on any given page. Itâ€™s a great tool, but it can cause some pages to load incorrectly and mess-up social sharing buttons (if youâ€™re into that kind of thing).If youâ€™re looking for an email service that takes privacy seriously HushMail is a good option. However itâ€™s not perfect. Hushmail has to comply with court-ordered warrants from law enforcement, just like any other email provider (and it drew a lot of criticism for this). If you want more privacy over the content of your emails then you can use Mozilla Thunderbird in combination with an encryption tool like Enigmail. Thereâ€™s also Lavabit, which promises a privacy-orientated email service, but its servers are located in the US, which some say has less-stringent requirements for law enforcement access than Canada, where Hushmail is located.Diaspora was originally billed as a Facebook-killer back in 2010 when it first started out. That scenario is looking ever more unlikely, as the project was fraught with difficulties while Facebook has gone from strength-to-strength. Nevertheless, if youâ€™re looking for a social network that gives you control of your personal data â€“ via a decentralised network â€“ then Diaspora still a good choice. You could also try Friendica as another privacy-orientated social network. A user in the comments section also recommends the decentralised social network Tent.Of course, youâ€™re not really anonymous online unless you use a VPN of some sort to shield your IP address. Tor is a free VPN thatâ€™s aimed at protecting people from state-level privacy intrusions. Tor is a great way to protect yourself online, but it isnâ€™t perfect. The main problem is it allows anyone to set-up â€˜entryâ€™ and â€˜exitâ€™ nodes, through which your data travels (most people setting up nodes have good intentions, but if you donâ€™t know who they are then how can you trust them not to spy on your traffic?). The other problem with TOR is that it generally offers slower speeds than a privately run VPN. Of course, we have to shamelessly toot our own horn here and recommend iVPN if youâ€™re looking for a paid privacy-orientated VPN, with no bandwidth restrictions.Yes we know the headline says top 5, but as commentators have pointed out, omitting I2P is a bit of an oversight. I2P is an overlay network that allows other software to use it for anonymous communication, including web browsing, sending messages, blogging and file transfers. Itâ€™s compatible with BitTorrent clients such as Vuze and the I2P instant messenger. I2P is currently in Beta, but the developers say the code is stable enough for use.Satellites provide important data about potentially dangerous storms, but as many of these satellites reach the end of their lifespan, the United States could be facing a significant gap in weather coverage, reports the New York Times. A new polar satellite called the JPSS-1 is slated to launch in 2017, but several independent reviews suggest that this won't be in time to prevent a gap in coverage that could last a year or more. The reasons for the delayed launch include everything from reported mismanagement to a lack of adequate funding. And despite "urgent restructuring" at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, it doesn't look like the satellite will be launching in time to avoid the impending coverage gap, which could take place at some point between 2016 and 2018.The LG Optimus G and the Samsung Galaxy S III are the best Android can currently offer. Picking between a smartphone that came to the market five months ago and one that is just arriving might have seemed easy at first, but after the somewhat surprising finding in this review, things are less clear cut.The LG Opttimus G chipset is so vastly powerful that we expected it to swim laps around the Galaxy S III Exynos, but the smartphone was obviously let down by its software support. The LG flagship managed to win on many occasions, but the differences were pretty minor.The only place where the Optimus G was able to give its competitor a real trashing was GPU performance at 1080p resolution. On the other hand, the LG Optimus G lost the web browsing performance battle, which is one of the most common applications of smartphones these days.The 13 megapixel camera came as another disappointment to us. LG made quite a big deal about it, but as we found out it's not able to offering any real life advantage over the Samsung Galaxy S III 8MP shooter. Even worse - the Optimus G video recording comes seriously short of the Galaxy S III footage. Don't get us wrong - the LG Optimus G does some pretty good photos and decent videos, but if we had to pick one of these two for its overall camera performance it would probably be the Galaxy S III.Where the LG Optimus G comes out on top is design. It's all subjective, of course, and it might be that the Galaxy S III has been around longer so we are getting a bit bored with it, but we find the LG smartphone to be better looking than it. The extra gig of RAM is also a nice thing to have and makes the Optimus G more future-proof than its competitor.So on which of those two should you spend your hard-earned cash? It depends what you are looking to get from the deal really.If you are going SIM-free and it's value for money you are after, then by all means go for the Galaxy S III. Judging by the current pre-order prices the Optimus G will cost notably more than its competitor when it launches. The Galaxy S III will let you save about 150 euro and still give you impressively solid smartphone experience and even treat you to a newer Android release. Not to mention that the microSD card slot allows for extremely cheap memory expansion.On the other hand, if money is no object for you (which is usually the case with those looking for high-en smartphones) or your carrier has helped even the field with its subsidies things are looking far more favorable for the LG flagship. It might not be able to assert its dominance over its competitor now, but once LG releases its Jelly Bean update, it should become a real beast.There's just no way the Galaxy S III can fend off the attacks of the newer chipset forever. The LG Optimus G has a sharper screen of slightly higher resolution too, which while lacking the wow factor of the Galaxy S III AMOLED, is far better for productivity and can really help put those four Krait cores to good use.So it seems we are one software update away from the moment when the Galaxy S III finally gives up its throne and the LG Optimus G succeeds it. It up to LG to deliver that quickly and make its flagship the power user's dream device before the holiday shopping spree begins.UNITE HERE Local 11 organizer Martha Santamaria at a Holiday Inn LAXstrike on October 11. (Photo via UNITE HERE Local 11â€™s Facebook)During election season, we constantly hear candidates paying lip service to freedom as the highest American ideal.Â What we almost never hear, however, is a real discussion of the place most Americans have their freedoms curtailed: the workplace.Â For example, look at the Hyatt Andaz hotel in West Hollywood, California. The hotel housekeepers, represented by UNITE HERE Local 11, have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board over an electronic tracking system used to monitor their productivity.The housekeepers are given an iPod Touch to carry with them as they workâ€”but not to listen to morale-boosting music, or to communicate with one another as they clean. The iPods are outfitted with a program that tells the housekeepers which room to push their carts full of cleaning equipment to. There's a button to push when they start cleaning the room and another to push when they finish.The program is known as â€œRexâ€? because it features a running, tail-wagging dog animation. â€œWhoever thought of this system thought it was cute,â€? Cathy Youngblood, a housekeeper at the Hyatt Andaz, tells WorkingÂ In These Times. â€œIf you're a housekeeper you're not thought of as highly intelligent. This is American society. You're in a low position anyway. Now the dog has become our symbol at my Hyatt Andaz. We do run around like dogs, but still, we're not dogs.â€?The complaint was filed, not because this type of surveillance at work is illegal, but because it was imposed on the workers from above without a chance for them to bargain through their union. Under the terms of their most recent collective bargaining agreement, which both parties have agreed to abide by, the housekeepers should get some input before their work processes are drastically changed.The NLRB has agreed to hold hearings on the issue on November 26.â€œThey never ask for the housekeeper's input before they change the working rules. What does that tell me? That tells me we don't count for anything,â€? Youngblood says. The Hyatt's stated reason for the new system was â€œefficiency,â€? but, she pointed out, the best way to do things efficiently would have been to sit down and discuss with the people who know the job best: the workers who do it every day.â€œWhoever designed this system has not done hotel housekeeping,â€? Youngblood said. â€œThey may be a business major, and they may be a very good business major, but they have not done hotel housekeeping at Hyatt Andaz.â€?Â Under their old system, Youngblood explained, the housekeepers were given a paper at the beginning of the day listing the rooms they needed to clean, and they could do them in the most efficient manner. Now, with the Rex system, the iPod tells them which room to do next, even if that room is on another floor. They may make the trip from floor to floor, pushing their 100-pound carts on carpet, many times rather than just one. â€œIt creates unnecessary travel time, and a housekeeper doesn't even have an extra minute,â€? she said.In addition to feeling belittled by the choice of a dog as a symbol, Youngblood and the other housekeepers are upset about the way the system monitors their work process. â€œI don't know if it was their intent to also do surveillance on us,â€? she explained, â€œbut it has become a surveillance system.â€?The computer system allows supervisors to see exactly where housekeepers are at any time, how long it takes them to complete a room, and when they clock out for a break. Youngblood said that while she's working, she has gotten surprise phone calls from a supervisor tracking her with the system.Corey Robin, Brooklyn College professor andÂ author of the book Fear: The History of a Political Idea,Â commented to WorkingÂ In These Times:Youngblood noted too that the new system allows the supervisors free time to attend meetings, rather than requiring them to be a presence in the halls to attend to housekeepers' questions immediately. Now, she said, everything goes through the computerâ€”if they are missing something they need, they have to stop and use the iPod to report a problem.Apple could not be reached for comment, but Robin noted the gulf between what the iPod Touch was designed for and its use as a tool of control:One of the items in this story that most reveals the gulf between the lives of workers and the lives of professionals and media types is the iPod. For many people, the iPod is their freedom: they get to choose their own music, fashion their own media, suit everything to their own particular tastes. But for housekeepers in a hotel, it's an instrument of submission and domination. We know the terrible stories about how iPods get produced (in faraway lands). But what about the terrible stories of how they get used, not merely elsewhere but also here, in the US?The housekeepers are already subject to inspection of the rooms they clean, as well as the possibility of guests' complaints if a room is not up to their standards. All of this can subject them to the hotel's â€œprogressive discipline," a series of escalating punishments for each infractionâ€”a verbal warning, one day of lost work, then two, and so on. A severe guest complaint, Youngblood said, can lead to termination right awayâ€”and, she noted, the people they're serving expect a lot from them. â€œYou are serving pretty much the 1%,â€? she said. â€œI call it a high roller hotel.â€?This is not the first complaint the union has made against Hyatt, by a long shot. Earlier this year, UNITE HERE and community and labor allies including the AFL-CIO, NOW and the NFL Players Association launched aÂ boycottÂ of the Hyatt chain over its treatment of employees. The hotel chain has deniedÂ that it mistreats workers.For Youngblood, this episode is symptomatic of how the hotel chain treats her and her colleagues. â€œIf you had a respectful employer-employee relationship, if we are counted as family, if their door is always open, we should not have had to go to the NLRB,â€? she said. â€œWe women, we know when we're being treated wrong.â€?In the midst of an ever-increasing list of multi-million-dollar campaigns, who in their right mind would run a Kickstarter for $1?Right now, 16 projects on Kickstarter have reached and exceeded the million-dollar mark. Some have become household names â€” Ouya, Pebble â€” and while theyâ€™ve engendered heavy media coverage, theyâ€™ve also raised questions about what to expect from Kickstarter as a platform. But what about the little ones â€” the Joe the Plumbers of the Kickstarter world? Theyâ€™re out there, maybe more than you think, raising from $1 to $100. And, just like the behemoths, their stories have something to tell us about how Kickstarter works, and why, and what it means to the people who use it.What good does running such a small campaign do you?Â Publicity, for one thing. An almost guaranteed success, for another.Â We posed this question to the creators of the least ambitious Kickstarters we could find, from $1 for a podcast to $50 for handmade mugs, and their answers offered some insight into bigger questions, the kind that creators and backers wrestle with, no matter how big their projects.Kickstarter as an organization doesnâ€™t encourage lowballing. They even counsel creators to make their goals reflect the cost of their project, says Kickstarter spokesperson Justin Kazmark.â€œTrying to circumvent the all-or-nothing model is not what the Kickstarter experience should be about,â€? Kazmark says, adding that itâ€™s also the backerâ€™s job to decide whether that influences their decision. â€œA creatorâ€™s funding goal should be an accurate reflection of the costs of the project and if itâ€™s clearly not, backers can take that into account.â€?But Kickstarter as a platform can, in some cases, offer benefits to those who aim low. Itâ€™s easier to reach, of course. And backers may be more likely to fund something they think will reach its goal. After all, nobody likes to fail.But if lowballing your goal makes you more likely to reach it, it also brings the risk that, given that amount of money, you canâ€™t fulfill your promises to your backers.Myq Kaplan, a stand-up comedian starting a podcast, reached 99,600 percent of his $1 goal. His bounty of nearly $1,000 will offer a bit of a buffer, he says, in case he incurs unexpected costs. But how would he have completed a podcast had he raised just a dollar, or even ten?â€œThe thing is, number one, I want to have a podcast,â€? he says. â€œAnd so, if there was no Kickstarter, I would be happy to invest my own money into making a podcast.â€?It doesnâ€™t hurt that itâ€™s very cheap to make a podcast, he adds. (Kaplanâ€™s projectÂ is now live, with two episodes posted so far â€” a cool $498 per show.)â€œIâ€™m just a fan of having reasonable to low expectations, like no entitlement to anything in life,â€? Kaplan says. â€œPick something you can achieve, and vastly exceed it if you can.â€?So if Kaplan didnâ€™t need the money, if he was going to do his podcast anyway, why bother? Publicity, for one thing: â€œI figured this would just be a bonus to get people excited about it,â€? he says.In that, heâ€™s not alone. Roots Worship/Live from the Trash Bar, NYC had already raised some funds, according to creator John Barnett. The $2,205 raised for the album â€” recorded at a church service in a bar in August â€” vastly exceeded the projectâ€™s $25 goal, but that wasnâ€™t the point.â€œIt was more of a marketing concept and a unique way to pre-sell the album than a fundraising one, although what money we did raise was gladly appreciated,â€? he says. â€œUltimately, the Kickstarter site is only a piece of the puzzle in getting visibility of the project in a music industry that is bloated and looking for ways to survive in the digital world.â€?But Barnett had already raised some funds. While Kickstarter allows this â€” Kazmark says creators have received funding from grants and foundations â€” it can make for some pretty bad publicity. Ouya founder Julie Uhrman backpedaled frantically after backers jumped on her for telling Develop that Ouya was looking for additional funding. Itâ€™s not just a matter of fidelity; a creator beholden to multiple entities â€” say, a venture capital firm â€” could be forced to fulfill commitments to their investors prior to, or in place of, their Kickstarter backers. But in a small project, the ability to shoot low often means thereâ€™s funding coming from somewhere else, even if itâ€™s the creatorâ€™s own pocket.'Horrible write speeds', 'vanishing storage'... but it IS early in the RCI have been watching a few Storage Spaces discussion threads on Microsoftâ€™s support forums with interest. Storage Spaces is a new way to manage disk storage in Windows 8 and Server 2012. It allows you to create a pool from two or more drives, create virtual drives on them with an option for RAID-like resilience, and add or remove physical drives as needed when drives fail or more storage is needed.It's a great feature, and particularly since it comes from the server team you would expect it to be solid. Nobody can afford to use storage that is unreliable.Look at this thread though, based on Windows 8 Enterprise Evaluation which should be the RTM code:I had three empty discs which I used for it: 320 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB. The manager told me that the maximum capacity for this setup would be ~2 TB. I then proceeded to fill the space up, resulting in a horrible write speed of ~20 MB/sec. Okay, that can be accepted, it is a software solution, after all. Hereâ€™s the kicker, though: Upon reaching ~0.9 TB, the storage space vanished! Yes, vanished. After invoking the Storage Space Manager, I discovered that the space was deemed â€œfullâ€? and that I was to add another disc. I also took a look at the volumes itself. Hmmh. The 320 GB disc was 100% filled, the 1 TB was at 32% and the 2 TB at 16%. And what are 32% of 1 TB and 16% of 2 TB? Why, 320 GB! So, instead of creating a Parity storage space, it simply downsized every hard disc to the lowest denominator, i.e. 320 GB. Which means that there are two massive problems here: Itâ€™s lying about the remaining capacity (which is confusing in itself: The manager talks about the storage space having a 2 TB capacity, but directly above it talks about a 3.01 pool capacity?) It also gives no warning when the real capacity is reached and the pool is deemed â€œfullâ€?. It simply takes the pool offline (instead of, say, reverting to a â€œread-onlyâ€? mode with a warning) and you have to bring it online manually. Not fun.Or have a look at this (which likely refers to the release preview) â€“ the article it is commenting about is worth a read to.Iâ€™ve run into a major problem with storage spaces. My storage space is full. Having a full storage space puts it into an error state, and it goes offline. You can click â€œBring onlineâ€? but it immediately goes offline again. So, I canâ€™t free space on it, because I canâ€™t get it online to delete stuff. And, more importantly, I canâ€™t get anything off of it because it wonâ€™t stay online. It seems my only option is to add three drives, as I had it set to parity. The only problem? I donâ€™t have three more drives to add.Even bugs in the release preview worry me. Storage is so fundamental that I would expect a feature like this to be 100 per cent solid early in the release cycle, or pulled.We asked Microsoft to comment, but the software giant is still investigating.

Thankfully, Microsoft's new Windows 8 store offers quick access to a number of the applications you'd normally have to go hunt down anyway, but it also has some real treasures worth downloading. Here are some of the best.The Windows 8 Store is surprisingly large and full of useful apps for an OS and product this new, so don't hesitate to try something new if it looks like it'll be useful for you. There were plenty of apps we didn't cover here because they were either really geared towards Windows 8 tablets like the Surface, or because they came from developers we weren't terribly familiar with. Just like with mobile apps, make sure you take a look at the developer and the permissions an app requires before you install it, and a good glance at the reviews won't hurt either, although you should always take those with a grain of salt.We should also note that reading news and browsing headlines on the Start Screen was a joyâ€”and there are plenty of apps for newspapers, magazines, and even some tech blogs. Most of the apps just reformat the top stories and articles for comfortable tiled viewing, but it's definitely a fun and interesting way to surf the headlines. With more apps coming to the Windows 8 Store every day, if you don't find an app specifically for your favorite web site or service, just stay tunedâ€”it'll likely appear quickly.Upgrade to the latest Flash Player for improved playback performance.

The device consists of a doughnut-shaped reactor called a tokamak, wrapped in superconducting magnets that squeeze and heat a plasma of hydrogen isotopes to the point of fusion. The result should be something that no experiment to date has been able to achieve: the controlled release of ten times more energy than is consumed.That's the dream. But so far, ITER has been consuming mostly money and time. Since seven international partners signed up to the project in 2006, the price has roughly tripled to around â‚¬15 billion (US$19.4 billion), and the original date of completion has slipped by four years to late 2020. Many of the delays and cost increases have come from an extensive design review, which was completed in 2009 (seeÂ 'Fusion dreams delayed').Now, sources familiar with the project warn that the complex system for buying ITER's many pieces could put the project even further behind schedule. Rather than providing cash, ITER's partners have pledged 'in kind' contributions of pieces of the machine. Magnets, instruments and reactor sections will arrive from around the world to be cobbled together at the central site in St-Paul-lÃ¨s-Durance in southern France.Â Because no one body holds the purse strings, designs for the machine's components face a tortuous back-and-forth between the central ITER Organization and national 'domestic agencies', which ensure that local companies secure contracts for ITER's components.Nowhere is the problem more pronounced than the tokamak, the central structure that will eventually house ITER. The construction of the building is meant to be contracted outÂ by Fusion for Energy (F4E), Europe's domestic agency. But the ITER Organization could notÂ tell the agency what neededÂ to be built, says Rem Haange, ITER's technical director, until it receivedÂ data from the other domestic agencies on the numerous systems and subsystems that the building must house. That process was seriously behind schedule when Haange arrived in 2011, he says. "Not a single piece of data had been given by the domestic agencies."Haange says, however, that the project remains firmly on schedule, and he is racing to make up for lost time. A task force of engineers is working through the tokamak building design floor-by-floor to finalize it. "We have a deadline for every floor level, and we are just about making it," he says. The final design will be finished in March next year, but to keep the project on schedule, F4E must tender the construction contract by the end of this year.F4E is also encountering trouble on another key contract, for the giant poloidal field coils that will wrap around the girth of the machine. The coils are among the largest in ITER, and the bottommost ones must be completed before the machine can be assembled. The ITER Organization authorized procurement of the coils in 2009, but F4E's tender received just a single, joint bid from the French firm AlstomÂ and the German company Babcock Noell.F4E rejected the bid because it came in far above the agency's cost expectations, according to multiple sources, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the bidding process. Isabelle Tourancheau, a spokeswoman for Alstom, said that the bid had failed after "long and difficult technical and commercial negotiations". Aris Apollonatos, a spokesperson for F4E, says that the contract will now be broken into seven parts to make it more attractive to competitors and put it back out to tender. A meeting earlier this month garnered interest from 27 companies, he says.Despite the tight schedule, both Haange and Apollonatos say that they will not ask for more time at next month's ITER council meeting in Cadarache, France. "We remain committed to delivering on all fronts and in line with the ITER schedule," Apollonatos says. Haange says that Osamu Motojima, director-general of the ITER Organization, is already looking at "simplified assembly", a further stripping-down of the already bare-bones first version of the machine, to keep the project on track. "We will ask for more time only if it is absolutely necessary," Haange says.But holding onto the date for start-up may delay the first power-producing experiments, now scheduled for late 2027 or early 2028. Those experiments require a radioactive isotope of hydrogen called tritium to be produced on site. The necessary tritium plant may have to be delayed to keep to the current budget and schedule, Haange says. That delay may be politically unacceptable, Â he says. "We will have to find ways of recovering potential time delays."Diigo, a social bookmarking and annotation site, is finally back online 50 hours after the domain was first hijacked. Itâ€™s an incredible story that involves crisis management, blackmail, investigative research, payoffs, a clever thief, and points to potential problems with the domain name registry system that could affect anyone with a website. Diigoâ€™s co-founder called it a nightmare and crisis that heâ€™d like to help other companies avoid.Diigo has 5 million registered users. For two days this week, they couldnâ€™t access the site. The service is both a collaborative research tool, and a social content site. TechCrunch called Diigo â€œa research tool that rocksâ€?, back in 2006. Iâ€™m a big fan and started using Diigo (pronounced Deeâ€™go) to bookmark websites after Yahoo shut down its popular bookmarking site Delicious.This past Wednesday, I tried using Diigoâ€™s browser bookmarklet to save a site to my library. But, it didnâ€™t work. I went to the Diigo.com site and it got one of those junky parked domain pages that you see when you mistype a URL. My first thought was, did the site close or perhaps their domain name expire? I checked Diigoâ€™s twitter account and learned their domain was hijacked. The twitter account directed users to an emergency announcement that was put up at diigo.net, not diigo.com.The message also included a way users could help:On Friday afternoon, after 50 hours, the Diigo.com came back online.I contacted Wade Ren, Diigoâ€™s Co-founder and Executive Chairman to get the details of what happened. He agreed to share his story in the hope that other companies will learn some valuable lessons and not have a similar crisis.Ren told me â€œitâ€™s a nightmare since it was unexpected. It was a crisis because it may damage Diigo the brand if it isnâ€™t resolved quickly. And it was an ordeal to go begging for help and getting frustrating go-arounds.â€?The Diigo team learned their site was being redirected Wednesday morning. They did a WHOIS search and learned their domain was moved from their Yahoo domains to another domain registrar called Aust Domains.Ren called Yahoo to find out what happened. Ren says he had several calls with Yahoo over the course of 30 hours, but Yahoo staffers repeatedly told him they couldnâ€™t do anything to help. They insisted the only option was to file a police report, which Ren knew, at best, would take a long time to get his domain back.Ren also discovered Yahoo is not an official domain name registry operator, like GoDaddy, eNom, Tucows, and Melbourne IT. It turns out Yahoo is a domain reseller, and anyone using Yahoo Domains really uses a third party DNS registry operator. Renâ€™s account used Melbourne IT Ltd., based in Australia.I discovered that Yahoo discloses this in the fine print in our Small Business Terms of ServiceRen discovered that the actual DNS registry operator, Melbourne IT, would need to get involved to get this resolved. After much pleading, a Yahoo staffer called Melbourne IT to help, and was told that since the domain was transferred out, there was nothing they can do.At the same time, Ren called and sent an email to Aust Domains, where diigo.com was now registered. His email, titled â€œhigh traffic domains stolen, please help!â€? got a boilerplate reply from customer support saying:Aust Domains and Yahoo werenâ€™t going to help Ren get his domain back quickly. But then Ren was contacted by someone who could. The thief.The thief, who had a yahoo email address, wanted money in exchange for Diigo to get their domain back. Ren says the thief bragged about how he had done this many times before and was very careful.Of course, Ren in principle didnâ€™t want to do business with a cyber blackmailer. But, he wanted to get his site back as quickly as possible for his users and didnâ€™t want to deal with this problem much longer. He said the thief was well aware of the timing. He said the criminal knew it may still take 2 weeks for Diigo to get their site back even with the help of Yahoo, and it would be a lot quicker to pay him to get the domain back, otherwise known as blackmail.Weighting options, Ren decided to pay the money and was given the account information at Aust Domain so Diigo could get their site back, by pointing the DNS settings back to his servers. Ren doesnâ€™t want to disclose the exact amount of the payment, but it was in the 3-figures.Searching the web, Ren found many cases of domain hijacking, and in one case, by the same hijacker at HowardForum.com, the thief was paid $400. You can read the timeline of that attack here.In that case, the website owner says his registrar, GoDaddy, worked with Aust Domains to get the domain back. It took 13 days. Howard shared some of the emails he got from the thief:Back to Diigo, Ren says that at the same time he was in contact with the criminal, a more senior person at Yahoo got in touch with him. This person was much more eager to help.I sent requests via email and phone to Yahoo for comment. After 22 hours, Yahooâ€™s PR department told me they will look into this. Iâ€™m still awaiting their reply and will update this post with any response.Ren says heâ€™s learned several lessons this past week that he wants to share.Ren isnâ€™t sure how the thief got the accountâ€™s password. He speculates it could have happened on some public wifi network and was perhaps sold to the blackmailer. But, all the thief needed to transfer the domain was his email and password.The thief was very careful according to Ren. He doesnâ€™t let his target know that heâ€™s hijacking their domain until itâ€™s too late. The thief didnâ€™t change his Yahoo account password. He just took actions to transfer the domain to the new registrar.Since the thief still had access to the Yahoo accountâ€™s email, Ren suspects the thief was watching his emails and quickly deleted ones that might have warned Ren of the domain transfer. This wasnâ€™t Renâ€™s main email account so he didnâ€™t check it as often.He says 2-step verification of logins could have prevented all this. Yahoo offers 2-step verification where â€œany sign-in attempt Yahoo! deems suspicious will require a second verification, either answering your accountâ€™s security question or entering a verification code we send to the mobile phone or non-Yahoo! alternate email address we have on file.â€?Ren says that unfortunately, this security feature is still in beta and does not seem to work as promised. After the hijacking happened, Ren says he tested his account and was surprised to find that he could still login without the verification step. When Ren told Yahoo about this problem during the hijacking, they asked him to fill out a bug ticket to report it.Would the domain locking featured offered by Yahoo and other registrars have helped? Ren says no, it only provides false hope. Since the thief had access to his account, the thief was simply able to turn domain locking off. And the thief was able to get the domain transfer authorization code, designed to prevent fraudulent or unauthorized transfer, because he had access to the account.Ren says heâ€™s learned itâ€™s better to use a domain name registry operator, rather than a reseller.Based on his experience, Ren says the the domain name registry system is flawed and it needs a system to freeze a domain transfer and revert the domain to its pre-transfer state, immediately after a transfer dispute is submitted, pending further investigation.Ren makes a comparison to the online banking industry. If someone steals you financial account, you have more recourse and security since further verification steps are typically required. But even though your website might be your most business important asset, you donâ€™t have the same protection from your domain host, and there ought to be better procedures and recourse in place to prevent this from happening.Until that happens, criminals will still be out there taking advantage of the situation and prying on unsuspecting website owners.Despite the inclement weather, Google was still able to announce the new LG-made Nexus 4 handset yesterday, and like the Optimus G on which it is based, this new phone should be quite speedy. Both phones use a 1.5GHz quad-core version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 Pro (part number APQ8064) paired with an Adreno 320 GPU. To put that in context, the dual-core versions of the S4 routinely match or beat the quad-core Tegra 3 and Exynos 4 from NVIDIA and Samsung, respectively, so the quad-core version of the chip should be a real monster.To explore just how fast the new Nexus phone will be, I asked our own Florence Ion to send me the benchmark results from the LG Optimus G she's currently reviewing. While there will be some subtle differences between the performance of the two phonesâ€”the Nexus is running Android 4.2, for example, while the Optimus G is still stuck on 4.0.4 for the time beingâ€”looking at how its non-Nexus cousin runs is going to tell us a lot about the latest Google-branded phone and whether it can stand up to the competition on both the iOS and Android sides of the fence.Let's dive right into the benchmarks to see just what kind of performance these phones will be able to deliver.In the Sunspider test, the quad-core Snapdragon handily beats the other Android devices in the lineup and the A5X in Apple's third-generation iPad (and, by extension, the A5 chips in the iPad 2, iPad mini, iPhone 4S, and iPod touch). The combination of the A6 and mobile Safari's generally faster JavaScript engine help the iPhone 5 stay ahead, though. The story is slightly different for the Google Octane test, where the Optimus G bests the iPhone 5 but can't outscore the dual-core Snapdragon in the Galaxy SIII, possibly a sign that the Optimus G's extra CPU cores are going unused.Moving on to our other CPU tests, Geekbench shows the Optimus G pulling ahead of the dual-core A5 in the number-crunching integer and floating point benchmarks but falling behind in the memory bandwidth tests. Memory bandwidth has long been a bottleneck for ARM chips (particularly those using Cortex A9 CPU cores, as we can see in the low iPad 3 and Nexus 7 scores), and its high memory and stream scores are probably what's helping the iPhone 5 outscore the competition in Linpack by such a ridiculous margin (the Optimus G can't beat the iPhone 5 here, but it does clobber the older Android devices).The quad-core version of the S4 also includes a beefed up Adreno 320 GPU, and its results are less ambiguous than our CPU testsâ€”after years of playing second fiddle to the graphics performance in iOS devices, Android is beginning to catch up. In the GLBenchmark offscreen tests, which render the same scene at 1080p on all GPUs to put them on even footing, the Optimus G keeps pace with the A6 and A5X in the Egypt HD test but falls behind in the older Egypt Classic test. As we can see in the onscreen test, however, this discrepancy shouldn't affect games too much when played on the phone's 1280Ã—768 display.The Nexus 4 will wipe the floor with the Galaxy SIII and Nexus 7 in both CPU and GPU performance, and while it doesn't always beat the Apple A6 in the iPhone 5, it's always very close in synthetic benchmarks. Between the two, the iPhone's dual-core A6 may have the advantage in real-world performance, since not all apps will be able to take advantage of all four of the Snapdragon's CPU cores, but we need more real-world comparison time to say for certain. If you can get past the lack of LTE, the Nexus 4 (and by extension the Optimus G, which will give you LTE but take away the Nexus line's guaranteed updates) is easily the fastest Android handset you can buy today. Look for our full review of both the Nexus 4 and Optimus G in the coming weeks.The GPU performance in particular is a good sign for Android devicesâ€”taken with the Nexus 10 tablet, which ships with a powerful Cortex A15-based Exynos 5 chip and a quad-core GPU, it shows an Android ecosystem that is finally beginning to take graphics performance as seriously as Apple's devices do. Expect our review of the Nexus 10 to go up next week, if Hurricane Sandy doesn't get in the way.Wikipedia, the encyclopedia for and by the internet, might just be done: Many of the main articles that the encyclopedia might possibly contain, from history to math and science, are almost complete. The Atlantic writes:It may seem impossible for an encyclopedia of everything to ever near completion, but at least for the major articles on topics like big wars, important historical figures, central scientific concepts, the English-language Wikipediaâ€™s pretty well filled out. (There is, of course, room for improvement in articles that have received less attention, but that is a different, yet still very important, set of challenges.) Thereâ€™s always going to be some tidying â€” better citations, small updates, new links, cleaner formatting â€” but the bulk of the work, the actual writing and structuring of the articles, has already been done.Of course, Wikipediaâ€™s not entirely done. New pages are added every day, for both new events and other odd nooks and crannies of humanity. And there are some pages that will be disputed forever, like the entry onÂ the bookLolitaÂ (should Humbert Humbert be referred to as the bookâ€™s â€œheroâ€??)Â and the one on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Some entries are being updated as news comes in, like the current entry on theSyrian civil war. When big events happen like the Japan tsunami, and the 2011 Tucson shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, entries pop up immediately.But for many, the best part of Wikipedia is its extensiveness. Its blanketing of our human experience. There is little that isnâ€™t included, even really weird things. In honor of the weirdness of Wikipedia, here are some of the strangest Wikipedia entries out there.1. A list of places with fewer than ten residents. This list includes several towns in Canada and towns with names like Mule Barn and Zug Island.2. The worldâ€™s littlest skyscraperÂ â€” which is in Wichita Falls, Texas, and is really just a regular sized building.3. The Pope Lick Monster is a part-man, part-goat, part-sheep (theyâ€™re not specific about which parts) that haunts a bridge in Louisville, Kentucky.4. Lists of lists of lists. Yes, this is a thing, and itâ€™s exactly what it sounds like.5. Mike the Headless Chicken lived for 18 months without a head. It might have been a hoax. But heâ€™s got his own Wikipedia page, regardless.6. Three Wolf Moon shirts swept the internet, and real life, around 2008. They have their own entry, explaining the irony and the phenomenon.7. Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone DenÂ is a poem consisting of the sound â€œshiâ€? repeated over and over again. But since there are many different tones used while pronouncing â€œshi,â€? to Chinese speakers, the poem makes total sense.8. Ghost ridingâ€”commonly used in the phrase â€œghost-riding the whipâ€?â€”as explained by Wikipedia.9. YOLO, the current awful catch phrase of young people, means â€œyou only live onceâ€? and is generally said before doing something dangerous or stupid.10. Robert Shields died in 2007, leaving behind a diary of 37.5 million words that chronicled every five minutes of his life.So, go forth and Wikipedia.How Many Women Does It Take To Change Wikipedia? Help Illustrate the Internet With Wikipediaâ€™s Photo ContestBlockbuster executive leadership change at Apple; Scott Forstall has been shown the door. Hereâ€™s the key passage:Jony Ive will provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design. His incredible design aesthetic has been the driving force behind the look and feel of Appleâ€™s products for more than a decade. Eddy Cue will take on the additional responsibility of Siri and Maps, placing all of our online services in one group. [â€¦] Craig Federighi will lead both iOS and OS X.Forstall has long been a polarizing executive within Apple. Remember this piece by Austin Carr for Fast Company six weeks ago, on the tensions within the company regarding skeuomorphic UI design?:Inside Apple, tension has brewed for years over the issue. Apple iOS SVP Scott Forstall is said to push for skeuomorphic design, while industrial designer Jony Ive and other Apple higher-ups are said to oppose the direction. â€œYou could tell who did the product based on how much glitz was in the UI,â€? says one source intimately familiar with Appleâ€™s design process. But before Forstall, it was Steve Jobs who encouraged the skeuomorphic approach, some say.The biggest tell, though, might have been this interview with Jony Ive by Shane Richmond for The Telegraph, back in May:When I mention the fake stitching, Ive offers a wince but itâ€™s a gesture of sympathy rather than a suggestion that he dislikes such things. At least, thatâ€™s how I read it. He refuses to be drawn on the matter, offering a diplomatic reply: â€œMy focus is very much working with the other teams on the product ideas and then developing the hardware and so thatâ€™s our focus and thatâ€™s our responsibility. In terms of those elements youâ€™re talking about, Iâ€™m not really connected to that.â€?Heâ€™s connected to it now.Forstall has been around for a long time: he started at NeXT in the early â€™90s and had been involved in the evolution of NeXTStep, Mac OS X, and iOS ever since. That makes it all the more telling that Appleâ€™s press release contains no quote from Tim Cook offering kind words or thanks to Forstall. Compare and contrast to the quote from Cook when Mansfieldâ€™s (now cancelled) retirement was announced in May, or the personal quote from Bertrand Serlet when he stepped down in March 2011. Forstall is not walking away; he was pushed. Potential factors that worked against Forstall: his design taste, engineering management, abrasive style, and the whole iOS 6 Maps thing. I also wonder how much Forstall was effectively protected by his close relationship with Steve Jobs â€” protection which, obviously, no longer exists.Say this for Forstall, though: heâ€™s been in charge of iOS from its inception, and my understanding is that he, along with Bertrand Serlet, were the leading proponents of using OS X as the foundation of the iPhone (as opposed to something more like the embedded OS that runs iPods other than the Touch). No one is more excited than I am to see Jony Iveâ€™s design taste spread to Appleâ€™s software, but under Forstallâ€™s leadership, iOS has been an unprecedented success.In what was almost a mere postscript to the press release, Apple also announced that theyâ€™ve canned retail chief John Browett, whose performance has garnered zero acclaim. Canning Forstall is a big change; Browett, on the other hand, is still so new that he never even got around to managing a single holiday quarter. I wouldnâ€™t read anything more into Browettâ€™s departure than that Tim Cook knows how to recognize a mistake and correct it. (Although it was Cook who hired Browett in the first place.)One of the things I admire about Apple is their plainspokenness, both in advertising and in press releases. Just today I linked to a piece by Derek Thompson for The Atlantic, in which he makes the interesting observation that Appleâ€™s quarterly earnings releases contain remarkably fewer words than other large corporations. At first glance, the headline of the press release announcing Forstallâ€™s departure seemed to go against this: â€œApple Announces Changes to Increase Collaboration Across Hardware, Software & Servicesâ€?. That was followed by a subhead: â€œJony Ive, Bob Mansfield, Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi Add Responsibilities to Their Rolesâ€?.Thinking about it some more, though, and considering what I know about Forstallâ€™s reputation within the company, I think that headline, euphemistic though it is, tells the plain truth: Forstall was an obstacle to collaboration within the company. Now heâ€™s gone, and his responsibilities are being divided between four men who foster collaboration: Ive, Mansfield, Cue, and Federighi.Federighi, like Forstall, dates back to NeXT, and has moved up the ladder quickly after returning to Apple in 2009. Mansfield has had a curious year â€” five months ago he was retiring, then he un-retired, and now heâ€™s taking over a new â€œTechnologiesâ€? group encompassing all wireless and semiconductor engineering. Who better to take over Maps than Eddy Cue, the guy who took over the disaster that was MobileMe and turned it into the far-from-perfect-but-pretty-good-overall and steadily improving iCloud?But the big news today is about Jony Ive. I donâ€™t think it can be overstated just how big a deal it is that he now oversees all product design, hardware and software. For the last year, outside observers have been left to wonder just where the buck stopped for UI design at post-Jobs Apple. That question has now been answered: Jony Ive.Internet Explorer 9 gives you control over your privacy by blocking online tracking.

Other stores drew crowds too.(And all three Surface models are back-ordered three weeks on Microsoft's online store.)I was surprised to see any line at all. After reading some reviews, you would have thought that the thing was DOA.Fortunately, I had plenty of time to try out the tablet for myself. Ill-conceived, unusable keyboard? Nope. Yeah, it takes getting used to, but the 3mm-thick keyboard is far from unusable and beats a virtual keyboard any day.And besides, for a few bucks more you can get the other Surface keyboard that Microsoft is selling, which is a real keyboard -- responsive and easy to use.And as I've been saying for a while now, as an interface, I like Windows 8 and its split personality.For Microsoft, one of the more encouraging signs (I saw) was the intensity of interest. Customers had lots of questions about Surface and some sat there for 30 minutes or even an hour kicking the tires (or, in this case, pounding on the 3mm keyboard).If Microsoft can maintain that kind of enthusiasm, it has a chance to make a run at the iPad and MacBook.The other unmistakable change at the Microsoft store (which I visit often) was a crop of new Windows 8 laptops with touch screens.There were new Asus, Acer, and Sony clamshell laptops -- all touch capable. For me, this is a watershed feature and big leg up on Apple.Some reviewers believe that touch screens and clamshells go together like oil and water. Not me. I want the option to use the touch screen. I mean, why not have a touch display? It's there if you need it. And I know I need it.And new touch-capable Windows 8 laptops, like the razor-thin $1,299 Acer Aspire S7 (it boasts a 13.3-inch 1,920x1,080 display), are very capable rivals to the MacBook Air.And there are less expensive touch-screen laptops too, like the $699 Acer Aspire V5 and the $549 Asus VivoBook X202E.And note that these all run the full Windows 8 on Intel. So you're not getting shortchanged on applications -- a common complaint cited by Windows RT reviews.Which brings us to the next Surface tablet -- the Intel version with Windows 8 Pro. Though under 2 pounds and only 0.53 inches thick, it will pack a 10.6-inch 1,920x1,080 display, Mini DisplayPort, 4GB of memory, up to 128GB of solid-state drive storage, and a Core i5 chip.It will obviously be more expensive, but it may be a more viable version of Surface for consumers worried that RT won't cut it. (Or for those who take it home only to find that RT doesn't run all of their favorite Windows applications.)Will the Pro version prove to be more popular than Surface RT? We should know by early next year when it debuts at the Microsoft store.If you want to find the secret of Apple's success boiled down to its simplest form, look no further than an interview with Apple Senior Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller. In comments given to Time, Mr. Schiller said that old technologies are anchors holding the world, or at least his company, back, and that his company isn't afraid to ditch them.Mr. Schiller was asked about the new Mac hardware introduced during Tuesday's iPad mini media event, including the lack of optical drives in the company's new iMac line."These old technologies are holding us back," he told Harry McCracken. "They're anchors on where we want to go. We find the things that have outlived their useful purpose. Our competitors are afraid to remove them. We try to find better solutions â€” our customers have given us a lot of trust."Contrast this with Microsoft, a company desperately afraid of leaving Windowsâ€”the source of the company's vast wealth and successâ€”behind. Microsoft's Windows 8 strategy has been to anchor media tablets down by marrying them to the desktop metaphor where Windows matters.Microsoft hopes that it can have its Windows cake and eat into Apple's iPad empire, too, but that strategy has seen Windows-based touch tablets stagnate. The company released Surfaceâ€”its own version of the toaster-fridge conceptâ€”on Friday, and I will be very surprised if it any way changes anything.Microsoft and its PC OEMs are far too terrified to simply shuck aside legacy technologies, whereas Apple will ditch something it no longer wants without a second thought. For instance, you can still find VGA ports on Dell computers...why?Note to Dell: Your website still sucks, and it doesn't even consistently suck. Different UI elements on different device pages? Different layouts? Please, it's 2012.Apple has gone through, what, six display technologies since VGA mattered? DVI, Mini-DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, mini DisplayPort, and now Lightning? That's six, and with each move, Apple dumped the predecessor with little or no concern for those with legacy hardware.Floppy drives? ADC? FireWire? FireWire 800? Gone the way of the dodo. Now we have optical drives, and sooner, rather than later, hard drives will be few and far between on any Mac. On the iOS side, Apple just recently gave its own 30-pin Dock connector the boot.Offering some insight on the company's thinking, Mr. Schiller said, "In general, it's a good idea to remove these rotating medias from our computers and other devices. They have inherent issues â€” they're mechanical and sometimes break, they use power and are large. We can create products that are smaller, lighter and consume less power."The company has been very successful doing this, too. Apple has outgrown the PC market since George W. Bush was president, and the company is selling record numbers of its Mac computers, even while its iOS empire has grown larger still.Simple, streamlined, integrated, smaller, lower power...this combination has been part and parcel to Apple's stellar growth during the last ten-plus years.Admittedly, Apple has often gotten pushback for its decisions to drop legacy products. As someone who prefers to buy music on CD and rip it in a lossless format (Apple Lossless currently), and who prefers Blu-ray movies for the quality and the extras, I personally lament the loss of optical drives and wish I could watch my Blu-ray movies on my Mac.Apple doesn't care, however, and that's for the best. Also, and this is important, those of us who get anxious when our beloved legacy thing gets axed eventually get over it. There was much gnashing of teeth and wailing when the original iMac was introduced without ADC or a Floppy, and that was from Mac fans. Do you remember how the PC world laughed and pointed?Who's laughing now? (Hint, it's Apple on the way to the bank to drop of sacks full of cash.)Even Blu-ray, a technology that many Mac users clamored for (see above), gets nary a peep from customers these days, according to Mr. Schiller.The Apple marketing guru also spoke to the rush-to-the-bottom approach of all of its competitors, saying, "Our approach at Apple has always been to make products we're proud to own and use ourselves. We wouldn't make something cheap or low quality."This also is part and parcel to Apple's success. When the economy fell off a cliff in 2008, Apple's stock tanked like the rest of the markets, but the astounding thing was that Apple's results accelerated, rather than declining."When the economy is difficult," he said, "people care a great deal about the things they spend their money on. Customers have come to understand that Apple's products aren't priced high â€” they're priced on the value of what we build into them."To that end, he pointed to netbooks, once the (bleak) future of the PC market. Today, no one talks about netbooks, and that's entirely because Apple didn't jump on the bandwagaon."People said they were the future," Mr. Schiller said. "We rejected them because we thought they were poor. Even if the market was going there, we weren't going to chase everybody downhill."He added, "This is what Apple has always been about, and the Mac has been about, from the first Mac and first iMac. It's always been about making the best Mac we know how. Among the many benefits are making it easy to use and affordable, with great features. This high level of integration is part of delivering on that."If Apple's competitors were smart, they would break into Harry McCracken's office, steal his computer, find the full interview, listen to it over and over again, take copious notes, develop an action plan based on those notes, and then do the things on that action plan.If they were concerned about such subtleties as "the law," they would at least read the Time story over and over again and spend some time thinking about how their businesses differ from the ideals and thoughts laid out by Mr. Schiller.The truth is, however, that few of Apple's competitors are capable of running their businesses anything close to Apple's model. They don't control their ecosystem, they don't control their own hardware and software, they're tied into legacy technologies and ideas, they're afraid to charge a price that will actually sustain innovation, and they have little or no vision.That's why Mr. Schiller and other Apple execs can be so open about these things, and why Mr. McCracken's computer is safe.The hacker group says layoffs at Zynga will lead to the "end of the US game market as we know it" as jobs get shipped overseas, and it vows to take action.The hacktivist group Anonymous apparently is perturbed by the financial situation at Zynga.A posting on the AnonNews site this morning posits that layoffs at Zynga will help to bring about the "end of the US game market as we know it" as jobs get shipped overseas, a plan that the AnonNews report says was discovered in confidential files leaked from the games maker.During the last few days anonymous has been targeting Zynga for the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers. We have come to believe that this actions of Zynga will result in massive layoff of a thousand people and legal actions against everyone that speaks to the public about this plan. It will also come to end of the US game market as we know it as all this jobs will be replaced in other more convenient financial countries. With a billion dollars cash sitting in a bank we do believe that such actions are an insult to the population and the behaviour of corporations like Zynga must change.Beyond merely publicizing the alleged plan, Anonymous says it stands ready to retaliate -- it is threatening to "release also all the games we've taken from their servers for free," if Zynga doesn't call off the offshoring effort. The group did not specify what games it has taken but set a deadline of November 5 -- also known as Guy Fawkes Day, named for the English historical figure from which Anonymous derives inspiration.Zynga this week said that it is planning to lay off about 140 employees, or approximately 5 percent of its worldwide workforce. It is also closing its Boston office and expects to shutter its U.K. and Japan studios as well. That word came just a day before the FarmVille maker reported that it lost $52.7 million in the third quarter. The company also said it has a cash stockpile of about $1.6 billion.Financial troubles aside, Zynga has 5 of the 10 most popular games on Facebook, the massive social network that helped propel it into widespread popularity.Hackers penetrated the computer defenses of South Carolina's Department of Revenue and accessed 3.6 million social security numbers and account data for 387,000 payment cards, officials said. The Associated Press reported the intrusion also exposed citizens' tax returns, which typically contain much more sensitive personal information, but that couldn't immediately be confirmed.The breach, which occurred in mid-September, followed a series of attempted intrusions beginning in August, according to a press release. State officials have known of the data breach since October 16, and suspected an intrusion as early as October 10, but didn't disclose it until Friday, just hours before the start of the weekend. The underlying vulnerability that attackers exploited to access the state network was fixed on October 20.Officials have retained security firm Mandiant to assist in the investigation of the breach and to help secure the system. The state is also offering one year of credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection from Experian."The number of records breached requires an unprecedented, large-scale response by the Department of Revenue, the State of South Carolina and all our citizens," Governor Nikki Haley was quoted as saying in the press release. "We are taking immediate steps to protect the taxpayers of South Carolina, including providing one year of credit monitoring of identity protection to those affected."Of the 387,000 payment cards exposed, all but 16,000 were encrypted using measures "deemed sufficient" under credit card industry standards, presumably a reference to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which critics say doesn't go far enough in protecting account data. With a state population of about 4.6 million, the exposure could affect as many as much as three-fourths of South Carolina citizens.Windows 8 is finally here, and if you're used to previous versions of Windows then you're going to notice that quite a bit has changed. In fact, Windows has seen the biggest changes since the jump from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95.Out goes the Start menu, in comes the new touch-oriented Start screen, new apps, new interface conventions - even experienced PC users may be left feeling a little lost.Don't despair, though, help is at hand. We've been investigating every part of Windows 8, uncovering many of its most important tips and tricks, so read our guide and you'll soon be equipped to get the most out of Microsoft's latest release.Windows 8 opens on its lock screen, which looks pretty but unfortunately displays no clues about what to do next.It's all very straightforward, though. Just tap the space bar, spin the mouse wheel or swipe upwards on a touch screen to reveal a regular login screen with the user name you created during installation.

And if you're using a tablet then it'll all be very straightforward: just swipe left or right to scroll the screen, and tap any tile of interest.On a regular desktop, though, you might alternatively spin the mouse wheel to scroll backwards and forwards.And you can also use the keyboard. Press the Home or End keys to jump from one end of your Start screen to the other, for instance, then use the cursor keys to select a particular tile, tapping Enter to select it. Press the Windows key to return to the Start screen; right-click (or swipe down on) apps you don't need and select Unpin to remove them; and drag and drop the other tiles around to organise them as you like.The Start screen apps are initially displayed in a fairly random order, but if you'd prefer a more organised life then it's easy to sort them into custom groups.You might drag People, Mail, Messaging and Calendar over to the left-hand side, for instance, to form a separate 'People' group. Click the 'minus' icon in the bottom right corner of the screen to zoom out and you'll now find you can drag and drop the new group (or any of the others) around as a block.Right-click within the block (while still zoomed out) and you'll also be able to give the group a name, which - if you go on to add another 20 or 30 apps to your Start screen - will make it much easier to find the tools you need.Right-click in the bottom left corner (or hold down the Windows key and press X) for a text-based menu that provides easy access to lots of useful applets and features: Device Manager, Control Panel, Explorer, the Search dialog and more.The Win+X menu is useful, but no substitute for the old Start menu as it doesn't provide access to your applications. To find this, hold down the Windows key and press Q or either right-click an empty part of the Start screen or swipe your finger up from the bottom of the screen and select 'All Apps' to reveal a scrolling list of all your installed applications. Browse the various tiles to find what you need and click the relevant app to launch it.If there's an application you use all the time then you don't have to access it via the search system. Pin it to the Start screen and it'll be available at a click.Start by typing part of the name of your application. To access Control Panel, for instance, type 'Control'. Right-click the 'Control Panel' tile on the Apps Search screen, and click 'Pin to Start'. If you're using a touchscreen, press and hold the icon, then flick down and select 'Pin to Start'.Now press the Windows key, scroll to the right and you'll see the Control Panel tile at the far end. Drag and drop this over to the left somewhere if you'd like it more easily accessible, then click the tile to open the desktop along with the Control Panel window, and press the Windows key to return you to the Start screen when you're done.To shut Windows 8 down, just move the mouse cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen, click the Settings icon - or just hold down the Windows key and press I - and you'll see a power button. Click this and choose 'Shut Down' or 'Restart'.Some of the tricks available in previous versions of Windows still apply. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del, for instance, click the power button in the bottom right-hand corner and you'll be presented with the same 'Shut Down' and 'Restart' options.And if you're on the desktop, press Alt+F4 and you'll be able to choose 'Shut Down', 'Restart', 'Sign Out' or 'Switch User' options.At Yahoo!, we aspire to make the worldâ€™s daily habits more inspiring and entertaining. Our users have come to expect a personalized Yahoo! experience tailor-made for their lives â€” whether theyâ€™re checking local weather, sports scores, stock quotes, daily news, or viewing ads on our site. We fundamentally believe that the online experience is better when it is personalized.That said, we also believe that there should be an easy and transparent way for users to express their privacy preferences to Yahoo!. Thatâ€™s why we offer our own tools and resources such as Ad Interest Manager, to give users more control over personalized advertising on Yahoo!, and why we participate in industry-wide programs such as AdChoices, which allows users to learn why theyâ€™ve been shown an ad.Yahoo! has been working with our partners in the Internet industry to come up with a standard that allows users to opt out of certain website analytics and ad targeting. In principle, we support â€œDo Not Trackâ€? (DNT). Unfortunately, because discussions have not yet resulted in a final standard for how to implement DNT, the current DNT signal can easily be abused. Recently, Microsoft unilaterally decided to turn on DNT in Internet Explorer 10 by default, rather than at usersâ€™ direction. In our view, this degrades the experience for the majority of users and makes it hard to deliver on our value proposition to them. It basically means that the DNT signal from IE10 doesnâ€™t express user intent.Ultimately, we believe that DNT must map to user intent â€” not to the intent of one browser creator, plug-in writer, or third-party software service. Therefore, although Yahoo! will continue to offer Ad Interest Manager and other tools, we will not recognize IE10â€™s default DNT signal on Yahoo! properties at this time.Yahoo! is committed to working with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to reach a DNT standard that both satisfies user expectations and provides the best Internet experience possible. We will closely evaluate our support for DNT as the industry makes progress in reaching a meaningful, transparent standard to promote choice, reduce signal abuse, and deliver great personalized experiences for our users.This entry was posted on Friday, October 26th, 2012 at 5:49 pm and is filed under Privacy.

We felt that the situation was especially urgent in light of a recent Human Rights Watch report documenting the use of torture in 27 detention facilities run by Syrian intelligence agencies. Now it appears that our concerns were well-founded. According to a new Amnesty International report, a released detainee has informed Bassel Khartabilâ€™s family that he is being held at the Military Intelligence Branch in Kafr Sousseh and had been tortured and otherwise ill-treated.In response to this alarming news, Bassel's friends and supporters around the world have launched a letter-writing campaign, hoping to flood Syrian officials and diplomats with physical mail demanding that Khartabil be formally charged and given access to a lawyer or released immediately. Participants are encouraged to send photographs of their letters to info@freebassel.org.EFF has sent the following letter to Syrian officials: I am writing to you on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to express my concern over Bassel Khartabil, a Palestinian man born and raised in Syria, who has been detained incommunicado since his arrest in Damascus, Syria, on March 15. One week after his arrest, Khartabil was briefly brought to his home by some members of security forces who confiscated his computers and files. The Electronic Frontier Foundation does not have information about the reasons for his arrest, but we fear it may be connected to the ongoing unrest and armed conflict in Syria. A few weeks later when relatives inquired about him, security officials at the Kafr Sousseh Military Intelligence branch confirmed that Khartabil was detained, without revealing his whereabouts, his state of health, or if charges had officially been brought against him. International human rights standards require that detaineesâ€™ families are notified promptly after their arrest, and are allowed to communicate with detainees. Khartabil has also not been granted access to a lawyer, although international human rights standards require that detainees have access to a lawyer of their choice. A few weeks later, a released detainee informed Bassel Khartabilâ€™s family that he was being held at the Military Intelligence Branch in Kafr Sousseh and had been tortured and otherwise ill-treated, heightening our concern for his safety. Khartabil is also diabetic. It is not known if he has access to the medication he needs, if he has been provided with a diet that takes into account his diabetes, or if he has been granted a proper medical assessment. EFF urges the people detaining Kartabil to grant him immediate access to his family, a lawyer of his choice, and all necessary medical treatment. We urge you to protect him from torture and other ill-treatment. Additionally, we call on you to release Khartabil, unless he is promptly charged with an internationally recognizable criminal offence and tried in proceedings that respect international fair trial standards.EFF stands with Amnesty International, Creative Commons, Mozilla, and others in demanding Bassel Khartabil's safe return. We will continue to follow this case as it develops.This is the complete 50 minutes of my speech at the Belfast Media Festival 2012 see http://www.belfastmediafestival.co.uk/sessions/ on the future of media and the creative industries.

Holk Nielsen said that â€œif all ethanol plants in the US started using Avantec, they would save 3 million tonnes of corn.â€?Claus Felby, professor of biomass and bio energy at the University of Copenhagen, said that technologically, the enzyme was not a revolution, but that itâ€™s â€œvery smart to use the resources more efficiently.â€?â€œFirst generation bio ethanol is often criticised. But one tends to forget that just as much animal feed is produced when you produce ethanol from corn,â€? he said.First generation biofuels are made from the sugars and oils found in arable crops, while second generation biofuels are based on feedstocks that include crop residues, waste, algae and woody material.Dan Belusa, a sustainable agriculture campaigner with Greenpeace in Copenhagen, suggested Novozymes focus on second generation biofuels instead, a process in which enzymes can be used to convert municipal waste into resources.â€œThereâ€™s a world of difference between worsening a food crisis and â€¦ taking real waste and using that as a resource,â€? Belusa said.Earlier this month a UN official called for the European Union and the United States to abandon biofuels altogether as the land used to produce them was needed by farmers to grow food instead.Food security has emerged as a top item on the international agenda and critics claim that biofuels have pushed out food production in some areas, contributing to a global rise in food prices.This is the complete 50 minutes of my speech at the Belfast Media Festival 2012 see http://www.belfastmediafestival.co.uk/sessions/ on the future of media and the creative industries.

Ballmer mentioned the launch of Surface, but did not reveal any specific sales figures for that particular device.â€œStaff was rude, bad location, voter intimidation, chads hanging all over the place. One out of five stars; would not vote there again.â€?If you have a noteworthy voting experience on Nov. 6, whether itâ€™s particularly good or bad, you probably want to share it. Thatâ€™s the idea behind MyFairElection.com, a new site that creator Archon Fung calls â€œYelp for Democracy.â€?â€œIf the election of 2012 is anything like 2008 or 2004, thousands of Americans will be unable to vote because polling places will be closed, thereâ€™ll be long lines, machines will be broken, and some may even face intentional intimidation,â€? Fung, a professor of Democracy and Citizenship at Harvard, said on YouTube.Calling out which polling sites do a good job can â€œhelp ensure all Americans can exercise the right to vote,â€? he said.Thereâ€™s only a few categories to fill out: how long you had to wait to vote, whether one actually was allowed to vote, to rank to total experience from one to five stars, and a comment box.Fung wants at least 10,000 people to participate in crowdsourcing reviews of polling places across America. Weâ€™ll be able to see what election conditions are like all over the United States, in real time.â€?The voting map will be broken down to precincts, and color coding (red for one star, green for five) will show how accessible polling places are as voters review them.Just be sure to only review one spot a year.Most people know Nikon as a purveyor of pro and consumer-grade digital cameras. But the company's expertise with optics bleeds over into related marketsâ€”it's one of the science community's major suppliers of microscopes. And each year the company asks the community to send it some of their favorite images of tiny objects. A panel of scientists and journalists have chosen the best of this past year's submissions, which Nikon has placed on its Small World site.We've gone through and picked out some of our favorite images from this year, and Nikon provided some high-resolution versions. In keeping with the Ars tradition, where possible, we'll tell you a bit more about the subjects than you might get from the brief description on the original site.The grand prize winner at top highlights the blood vessels as they form in the brain of a zebrafish. The fish itself is transparent at this stage of development, and the blood vessels are tagged with a fluorescent protein, which allowed the researchers to image these tiny vessels at 20 times their normal size. The image is actually a composite of many individual images taken with a confocal microscope.Confocals only capture light from a single plane of focus, so each individual image is like an optical slice through the tissue. By changing the plane of focus and taking additional pictures, it's possible to create a stack of images (called a z-stack) that captures the three-dimensional details of the sample. In this case, the authors colored the blood vessels differently at different depths, allowing them to capture the sample's complexity.Lynx spiders are a very successful genus, with members found on every continent. Their most notable feature is the hexagonal arrangement of six of their eight eyes (the remaining two vary in position). Some members of the species are hunters and don't build webs. These newly hatched spiders were photographed at 6x magnification using reflected light. Like a number of the other winners, this image relied on a different type of image stacking. Rather than providing depth, a series of short exposures are merged to create a single image with pixels being averaged. This helps get rid of any noise in each individual exposure.Cancer's an ugly disease, but damn, this image of a cancerous cell looks good. The cell is outlined in purple by structures called actin stress fibers, which essentially form a tiny skeleton made of protein that helps give the cell its shape. The yellow spaghetti-like structures are groups of mitochondria, a small structure within the cell that helps convert sugars and other energy sources into the ATP that powers most proteins. Finally, the nucleus glows blue thanks to a dye called DAPI that sticks to DNA. In this case, the image is magnified at 63x, and is the merger of three separate images, one for each color.The red compound eyes of Drosophila have been such a huge part of the history of genetics, they're almost iconic. But for all of its early existence as a maggot, the fly uses a completely different set of eyes; the adult eyes only form while it's tucked away in a pupal case. This image captures the developing adult eye, showing its array of light-sensitive cells in (of course) red. These cells send signals back to the brain (green) using a huge bundle of axons, colored blue. That bundle of axons is much larger, relative to the eye itself, than the optic nerve we use to connect our eyes to the brain. This is another confocal image, and was probably made by flattening a z-stack of images, which is why there's such a good sense of depth.If you told me this was a computer generated image of a mothership hovering over a planet's surface, I would have believed you. Instead, I had to look up desmids, which turned out to be a form of green algae. I would have guessed this is a cell in the process of dividing, but it turns out that one of the characteristic features of desmids is that they're a single cell divided into two compartments. (See, even I'm learning something from this.) Desmids are so tiny that this image was taken at 100x power. The green backdrop? It's a moss.This image of an ant is much closer to life-sized, with only a 5x magnification. It's a pretty standard photo of an animal that everybody knows well, carrying its young (a pose I recall from my grad school days, when some ants tried to house their young in my shower). But the beauty is in the details, as the image stacking technique beautifully captures the delicate filaments and the fine details of the ant's antennae.Fossils, on their own, are pretty spectacular. But the mineralization of the sediments that often surrounds them adds a chance that they'll turn into something that more closely resembles a work of art. That's what happened in this case, where fossilized snail shells and ostraods have been embedded in a spectacular looking agate, which has since been sliced open and polished. The microscopy equipment needed to bring this to the fore is pretty minimal.When you work on animal development, you get used to watching tissues like a limb or spinal cord start out looking like a somewhat amorphous, cartoonish version of their later selves. Normally, this sort of thing is limited to the embryo, which is why biologists tend to be the only ones who see it. But for plants, this sort of developmental unfolding can literally take place thousands of times every year. In this particular case, the microscopists has captured a flower in the process of forming, with its various parts building up the cells needed to construct a colorful bloom, but still compressed into a compact form. A bonus is that it's a plant we don't even think about in terms of flowers: garlic.When the very first microscopes were made, their developers often turned them on a sample of water from a local source. Much to their surprise, the water was teeming with life. (You can now read one of the earliest descriptions online.) They had to attempt to capture what they saw by sketching it. We no longer face that kind of limitation, which is why we can look at spectacular images like this, at a magnification (400x) that the original microscopists never dreamed of. This image was taken with differential interference contrast, a technique that (as its name suggests), increases the contrast between objects, including ones that otherwise appear transparent. It also gives may structures a three-dimensional appearance, as you can see in the ciliated cells at center.This is a frond of red algae, captured in a darkfield image, where any area that doesn't have signal appears black. There's not a lot to say about it other than it seems to blur the boundaries between life and art.If you find that you disagree with any of the choices made by the judges of this contest, Nikon is accepting votes for alternative winners on its Facebook page.Wellington Secondary School has always been full of passionate citizens of the global community. Every year, the Student Council, environmental club, and other groups in the school devote time and energy towards projects that contribute supplies and finances to worthy causes. Wellingtonâ€™s focus for many years has been humanitarian charities. This year we have expanded our focus so our initiatives address not only humanitarian concerns but also environmental issues. The environmental club initially worked to help keep a local stream healthy, removed invasive species from parks, and conducted fish surveys. Â Now the club is taking on its greatest project yet, the building of aquaponics system in the schoolâ€™s inner courtyard.We hope to create a fully self-sustained system that promotesÂ Â  Aquaponics as a tool in Island food security.Â  In order to do this we are asking for community involvement.Â  We hope you will give us a discount on two deep cycle batteries so that we can run all of our pumps on Solar power.Â  We are very willing to publish thank you statements to your company in our contact with parents, the press and in our grant proposals.Â  We are also willing to mount a plague on our equipment.Â  Please go to Wellington Aquaponics @facebook to see more information.Â  The Aquaponics Project plans have been altered many times in order to construct the best possible blueprint for the project. What was originally going to be a 20ft wall covered in plants has morphed into what will become a smaller plant-covered wall attached to a tank. Water will be pumped up the vertical plant-covered wall and flow down into a large tank containing fish. The fish produce ammonia, which bacteria convert into nitrate. When the water from the tank is pumped, the plants on the wall benefit from the nitrate in the water and filter the water before it goes back into the fish tank. This system will be free of artificial fertilizers making it entirely natural.The positive outcomes from this project are numerous. We will grow eatable plants on the wall and raise tilapia fish so that what is produced by the Aquaponics System can be used by Wellingtonâ€™s cooking classes. Once the project is firmly established we can experiment with raising trout to maturity, which the school could contribute to help the repopulation of lakes and streams. The plants on the wall will act as a natural insulator, lowering school heating costs as well as reducing energy usage. As well as directly benefitting the environment, the system will provide students with the opportunity to get involved and to learn more about the environment through firsthand experience.One of the goals of the Aquaponics Project is to educate the public about the benefits of aquaponics. We want the community to know what we are doing and how they can help us and the environment. To reach this goal, we have created a MP4 video to present an understandable yet detailed description of the project. Because the multimedia form we chose is easy to upload to our online site, our Twitter page, and our Facebook page, we are able to spread the word through technology. The video shows images of hardworking students enjoying the work they are doing. This is fitting seeing as the spirit of the Aquaponics Project lies with the passion of the students.Wellington is proud of the work our environmental club has done on this project. We will continue to work towards our projects goals â€“ to efficiently build the system, educate the public, and promote sustainability in our school and greater community.We're looking for Linux gamers to install and test our new Steam for Linux client.

The worst place for a ship to find itself is in the eye of a major hurricane, but the second worst place is theÂ harbor.â€œThe term Safe Harbor doesnâ€™t pertain to storms the size of Hurricane Sandy,â€? says CaptainÂ John Konrad, who has experienced hurricanes first hand. â€œThe safest place for a ship is out to sea and as far away from the storm as possible.â€?Ships are built with hardened steel, but if left tied up to the dock, they can be easily damaged as waves push them against concreteÂ pilings. Â If a ship were to break loose from the dock, it would turn into a floating wrecking ball.For this reason, the United States Coast Guard recently closed most ports along the hurricane path and ordered all ships to leave port and head east at the best possible speed.With top speeds ranging between 15 and 30 miles per hour, commercial ships donâ€™t move very fast. Â Their only hope is to leave early enough to cross ahead of the hurricane path, hoping they donâ€™t get nailed by the storm. But this is not like a foolish teenagerâ€™s game of chicken with an approaching train. Â Hurricanes do not move on tracks and even the smallest veering of a storm in the direction of the ocean (east) will cause ships to get caught in its destructive path.â€œWhen battling a storm at sea, sizeÂ andÂ mass are your friend. Ships are built of heavy steel and designed to be capable of riding out most storms. â€? says Konrad. â€œ Even the largest ships however, like the 1,302 foot long,Â Â 170,974 ton container ship, Emma Maersk, can sink if she is beaten by massive waves for too long a period of time. This is why shipping companies keep a close eye on their ships and the path of all developing stormsâ€?.In theÂ CopenhagenÂ headquarters of Maersk, there is a room that looks more like a NASA control center than the offices of a major shipping company. Ship captains,Â meteorologistsÂ and executives sit behind banks of phones and computers while massive hurricane maps plotted with the location of every ship inÂ theÂ companyâ€™s fleet, are projected on the wall. Information from NOAA gets combined with weather data from the ships and experts in the movement of storms send alerts to each individual ship with guidance on the best route to take for avoiding the storm.With new mega-shipsÂ costingÂ hundreds of millions of dollars and with lives at stake, companies like Maersk spare no time or expense in providing weather advice and guidance to individual ship captains. But advice is all they can provide. â€œAt the end of the day,â€? says Konrad, â€œthe decision on where to pilot the ship is made by the ship captain. He is the person ultimately responsible for avoiding the storm.â€?The following video is an interview withÂ Steffen Conradsen, Head of Global Execution at Maersk Line, the worldâ€™s largest containership owner. Â ConradsenÂ gives us some insight into the decision-making process when ships encounter storms like Hurricane Sandy.For more information, video and pictures of ships caught in the hurricane check out gCaptain.comâ€˜s official shipping and transportation blog here on Forbes.Hurricane Sandy: How do Maersk ships ride out the storm?HootSuite just took another big step towards becoming the one dashboard you need to manage your social news feeds.The company announced Tuesday that it has added support for five additional social platforms including Reddit and StumblUpon to its social media dashboard.

In total, Hootsuite now offers support for 35 applications, including Flickr, Tumblr, YouTube and Instagram.SUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwire - Oct 29, 2012) - Â In a bold strategic move, AMD ( NYSE : AMD ) announced that it will design 64-bit ARM technology-based processors in addition to its x86 processors for multiple markets, starting with cloud and data center servers. AMD's first ARM technology-based processor will be a highly-integrated, 64-bit multicore System-on-a-Chip (SoC) optimized for the dense, energy-efficient servers that now dominate the largest data centers and power the modern computing experience. The first ARM technology-based AMD Opteronâ„¢ processor is targeted for production in 2014 and will integrate the AMD SeaMicro Freedomâ„¢ supercompute fabric, the industry's premier high-performance fabric.Â AMD's new design initiative addresses the growing demand to deliver better performance-per-watt for dense cloud computing solutions. Just as AMD introduced the industry's first mainstream 64-bit x86 server solution with the AMD Opteron processor in 2003, AMD will be the only processor provider bridging the x86 and 64-bit ARM ecosystems to enable new levels of flexibility and drive optimal performance and power-efficiency for a range of enterprise workloads."AMD led the data center transition to mainstream 64-bit computing with AMD64, and with our ambidextrous strategy we will again lead the next major industry inflection point by driving the widespread adoption of energy-efficient 64-bit server processors based on both the x86 and ARM architectures," said Rory Read, president and chief executive officer, AMD. "Through our collaboration with ARM, we are building on AMD's rich IP portfolio, including our deep 64-bit processor knowledge and industry-leading AMD SeaMicro Freedom supercompute fabric, to offer the most flexible and complete processing solutions for the modern data center.""The industry needs to continuously innovate across markets to meet customers' ever-increasing demands, and ARM and our partners are enabling increasingly energy-efficient computing solutions to address these needs," said Warren East, chief executive officer, ARM. "By collaborating with ARM, AMD is able to leverage its extraordinary portfolio of IP, including its AMD Freedom supercompute fabric, with ARM 64-bit processor cores to build solutions that deliver on this demand and transform the industry."The explosion of the data center has brought with it an opportunity to optimize compute with vastly different solutions. AMD is providing a compute ecosystem filled with choice, offering solutions based on AMD Opteron x86 CPUs, new server-class Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) that leverage Heterogeneous Systems Architecture (HSA), and new 64-bit ARM-based solutions.This strategic partnership with ARM represents the next phase of AMD's strategy to drive ambidextrous solutions in emerging mega data center solutions. In March, AMD announced the acquisition of SeaMicro, the leader in high-density, energy-efficient servers. With this announcement, AMD will integrate the AMD SeaMicro Freedom fabric across its leadership AMD Opteron x86- and ARM-technology based processors that will enable hundreds, or even thousands of processor clusters to be linked together to provide the most energy-efficient solutions."Over the past decade the computer industry has coalesced around two high-volume processor architectures -- x86 for personal computers and servers, and ARM for mobile devices," observed Nathan Brookwood, research fellow at Insight 64. "Over the next decade, the purveyors of these established architectures will each seek to extend their presence into market segments dominated by the other. The path on which AMD has now embarked will allow it to offer products based on both x86 and ARM architectures, a capability no other semiconductor manufacturer can likely match."At an event hosted by AMD in San Francisco, representatives from Amazon, Dell, Facebook and Red Hat participated in a panel discussion on opportunities created by ARM server solutions from AMD. A replay of the event can be found here as of 5 p.m. PDT, Oct. 29.About AMDAMD ( NYSE : AMD ) is a semiconductor design innovator leading the next era of vivid digital experiences with its groundbreaking AMD Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) that power a wide range of computing devices.

According to The Washington Postâ€™sGreg Miller, the NCTC is the designer and host of a futuristic â€œnew blueprint for pursuing terrorists, a next-generation targeting list called the â€˜disposition matrixâ€™,â€? which will not just provide names for kill lists, but map plans â€œfor the â€˜dispositionâ€™ of suspects beyond the reach of American drones.â€?And donâ€™t think what goes on at the NCTC only concerns the â€œbad guys.â€?Think instead of all the personal information that is collected about you and held in various databases. As ACLU staff attorney Alexander Abdo has written, under its new 2012 guidelines, â€œthe NCTC could potentially combine all the databases that store that sensitive and private information into a single, massive searchable and data-minable database.â€?He goes on:â€œThe guidelines accomplished this sweeping transformation of the NCTCâ€™s data-mining abilities primarily by allowing the NCTC to intentionally collect data on US citizens even where those people have no suspected ties to terrorism, and to keep that data for 5 years.â€? Before the guidelines were changed on March 22, 2012, data about ordinary Americans with no link to terrorism had to be discarded within 180 days.From the start, the NCTC has been a mega fusion center by design in search of an identity. And now it has emerged as nationâ€™s leading practitioner of â€˜Total Information Awareness.After the 9/11 Commission called for the establishment of a new intelligence unit which would compile â€œall-sourceâ€? information on terrorism and at the same time plan counterterrorism activities, the NCTC was established by Executive Order 13354 in August 2004. It was given an expansive statutory charter and placed in the newly-created Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) by the December 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act.As befitting its dual information collection/operation planning mission, its director (now former NSA general counsel Matthew Olsen) has a unique dual reporting role. He reports to the Director of National Intelligence when dealing with the collection and analysis of intelligence and directly to the President for planning joint counterterrorism operations. In time, this access to the White House would make the NCTC a logical choice for â€œdisposition matrixâ€? activities.But first, the new bureaucracy needed to muscle its way into territory locked down by various intelligence agencies, most prominently, the CIA Counterterrorism Center, which had in 2003 collaborated with the FBI, DHS and DOD to set up a new Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC).Eventually, the TTIC was integrated with the NCTC, and agents from the CIA, FBI, DOD, State Department, Treasury, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency among many other government agencies were enlisted as NCTC collaborators.But not everyone was happy with the results.In the spring of 2006, Rep. Bennie Thompson, a member the House Committee on Homeland Security, wrote an article for a law journal entitled â€œThe National Counterterrorism Center: Foreign and Domestic Intelligence Fusion and the Potential Threat to Privacy.â€?He warned that having the CIA, FBI and other agencies at the same table could pose a major threat to constitutional rights:â€œIn the NCTCâ€™s zeal to help root out terrorists and their plans, it is possible that the rules of foreign intelligence gathering, which are largely free of civil liberties concerns, will overtake traditional rules that apply to both domestic intelligence and law enforcement operations. Given the risk of â€˜mission creep,â€™ Congressional oversight alone will not ensure that the NCTC will adequately respect privacy rights.â€?And would it protect national security? In mid 2006, Karen DeYoungÂ in the Washington Post described a counterterrorism infrastructure â€œthat has become so immense and unwieldy that many looking at it from the outside, and even some on the inside, have trouble understanding how it works or how much safer it has made the country.â€?During the next few years, the safety issue would move from a behind-the-scenes concern to a public scandal.The NCTC was the keeper of the giant TIDE (Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment) system, which had by January contained the identities of some 500,000 people suspected of terrorist ties.According to Rep. Brad Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technologyâ€™s Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, â€œthe TIDE database is suffering from serious, long-standing technical problemsâ€? and the supposed â€œfixâ€? represented by the $300 million Railhead software â€œwill leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today.â€?TIDE, he wrote to the Inspector General of the ODNI on August 21, 2008, was unable to properly process tens of thousands of â€œpotentially vital CIA messages.â€? It contained fundamental design flaws that made the data in the system difficult or even impossible to search. It had a tendency to crash, and â€œthere is no fool proof way to ensure that only good data gets into the TIDE database and unqualified data stays out.â€?Just over a year later, the nationâ€™s intelligence flaws hit the headlines.After the father of a 23-year-old Nigerian national, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, told the US Embassy in Abuja as well as CIA officials about his sonâ€™s possible ties to extremists in Yemen, the youthâ€™s name was placed in the TIDE database.Despite the fact that Abdulmutallab had been listed on a UK watch list in May 2009, and despite intelligence about a plot involving a â€œNigerianâ€? trained in Yemen, his name was never moved from the TIDE system to the master watch list in the Terrorist Screening Center, maintained by the FBI, a NCTC partner. The giant US intelligence apparatus was therefore none the wiser when, on Christmas Day 2009, Abdulmutallab boarded a plane for Detroit with an explosive device in his underwear.Judging from thereport on the NCTC which Richard Best prepared for the Congressional Research Service in December 2011, questions about the appropriate role of the NCTC, about its relationship with the CIAâ€™s Counterterrorism Center and its ability to â€œconnect the dotsâ€? in a timely manner remain unanswered.Some 16 different agencies are now involved in NCTC information collection and analysis, and more than half of its staff of 500 are on detail from other agencies. Best highlights the problem of different bureaucratic cultures, and the fact that people who work there can be more loyal to their own agencies. He points to concerns that the NCTC approach â€œmay jeopardize privacy rightsâ€? especially in the case of â€œhome-grown terrorists.â€?Just how accurate is the information in the TIDE database?A recent Congressional subcommittee report on fusion centers suggests that being in the TIDE database is not necessarily a red flag for Department of Homeland Security officials. â€œWhile reporting information on an individual who is listed in the TIDE database sounds significant, the Subcommittee found that DHS officials tended to be skeptical about the value of such reporting, because of concerns about the quality of data contained in TIDE.â€?NCTC head Matthew Olsen told the Senate Homeland Security Committee on September 19, 2012 that key reforms have been undertaken to improve â€œNCTCâ€™s receipt, processing, and quality of information sharing.â€?How? By â€œtaking a more aggressive and innovative approach to seek methodologies and data repositories to ingest biographic, biometric, and derogatory information. As the threat continues to evolve, our watchlisting experts are proactively working with NCTCâ€™s Pursuit Group and the counterterrorism community to expedite the sharing of information to build more complex terrorist identities. We have also enhanced our ability to store, compare, match, and export biometrics such as fingerprint, facial images and iris scans.â€?So we now know that the NCTC has a â€˜Pursuit Groupâ€™ set up â€œto develop tactical leads and pursue terrorism threatsâ€? and is in hot pursuit of biometric data. We also know that â€œthe community watchlisting guidance was revised in 2010 to provide flexibility to push forward information that previously had not met the requirements.â€?Community watchlisting guidance? NCTC director Olsen hastens to add the following:â€œNevertheless, nominations of US persons to a watchlist must still be supported by â€˜reasonable suspicionâ€™ that the person is a â€˜known or suspected terrorist,â€™ and a person cannot be watchlisted based solely upon a First Amendment protected activity.â€?Coming immediately after his claim that the FISA Amendments Act was â€œthoughtfully crafted and carefully implemented to ensure the privacy and civil liberties of Americans are protected,â€? and his insistence that the newly-adopted NCTC guidelines â€œensure we protect civil liberties and privacy when executing our mission,â€? Olsenâ€™s rhetorical nod to constitutional rights seems unlikely to reassure Rep. Bennie Thompson, for one.And needless to say, the existence of a â€œdisposition matrixâ€? never gets a mention.January this year the U.S. Government destroyed Megaupload, but founder Kim Dotcom is a not done with the file-hosting business yet and is preparing a comeback with something bigger and better. Over the past months a group of coders have been working hard on the new â€œMegaâ€? venture and Dotcom announced today that the raid-proof service will launch exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down.With 50 million visitors per day at its peak, Megaupload was one of the largest websites on the Internet.This abruptly ended January this year when the U.S. Government took down the file-hosting service and had several key employees arrested including founder Kim Dotcom.Despite ongoing criminal proceedings Dotcom and his team are determined to launch a new Megaupload, which will simply be called â€œMegaâ€?.Initially the new Mega was expected to launch in 2012, but according to the latest information the launch is now scheduled for January 19 2013, exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down.â€œThe new Mega will launch exactly 1 year after the raid,â€? Dotcom announced a few hours ago, adding that thereâ€™s a Doomsday launch button in place, a reference to the device U.S. authorities claimed could have been in place to self-destruct the old Megaupload in the event of a raid.Previously Dotcom said that the coding work for the new Megaupload was nearly finished and that the servers had been ordered. Investors are lining up to join the new venture that Dotcom has described as a â€œmassive global network.â€?â€œAll non-US hosters will be able to connect servers & bandwidth,â€? he explained.According to Dotcom we can expect a Mega with an even greater range of applications than just file-sharing. Developers of file managers are being encouraged to get in touch for early API access, and Dotcom is also calling out to those involved in email and fax tools, VOIP and video apps.For users the new Mega will also mean more security. Uploaded files will be encrypted using the AES algorithm. Users will then be provided with a unique decryption key giving them sole responsibility for who can have future use of their files.Former Megaupload users who expect â€œMegaâ€? to give them access to their old files will be disappointed. While Megaupload is trying to convince the court to help users retrieve their old files, the new Mega is going to start from scratch.One detail that still remains a secret is the domain name the new Mega will be operating on. Megaupload.com remains seized and is therefore unavailable.Dotcom told TorrentFreak that he hasnâ€™t made a definite choice for a domain yet. He did register a few options this summer that would be fitting for the new service, and his other upcoming project Megabox.Whatever the choice turns out to be, January 19 is going to be an eventful date once again.The new version of Windows is now available on store shelves, and we have the complete lowdown on Microsoft's latest operating system. Join us as we thoroughly dissect the Windows 8 UI (Metro), Apps, Desktop, Gestures, IE10, SkyDrive, and Windows Store.During the past year, all corners of the technology community were abuzz with news, rumors, and opinions regarding Windows 8. The vast majority of that chatter involved the operating system's completely new tile-based user interface. Up until the end of this summer, the new UI was referred to as Metro. But Microsoft's marketing department decided to change the interface's name to Windows 8 UI.Big logo, right? Well, perhaps that's fitting, since Windows 8 is the biggest thing to happen to Windows since...well, windows. At this point, Microsoft could quite justifiably change the operating system's name to Tiles.As the resident â€œLinux guy,â€? I'm no stranger to drastic changes and bizarre user interfaces, though. I've seen plenty of both in Linux, and the shift to something new no longer scares me. Naturally, then, I was tasked with writing our Windows 8 review.My first foray into Windows 8 was with the Developer Preview released back in September of last year. Like (seemingly) everyone else, I was taken aback by the changes Microsoft presented in its then-Metro UI. But I thought, "Hey, it's just a developer preview. Most of this will probably change anyway."Next came the Consumer Preview in February. This release actually moved Windows 8 further away from the classic Windows experience. I rationalized the changes yet again. After all, it was just a beta, and carrying the label ofConsumer Preview, maybe it would yield enough negative feedback that Microsoft would have no choice but to reverse direction.Then, in May, Microsoft released its Windows 8 ReleasePreview. Surely this one would address the serious workflow and usability issues that bloggers were publicly skewering. Nope, not even close.Finally, a 90-day trial of Windows 8 Enterprise Edition was made available this past August, and I grabbed that too. Very quickly, I realized that Microsoft had no plans to pull the plug and back out of its bold design departure.Which brings us to the here and now: Window 8 is officially available for purchase. If you were waiting for Microsoft to jump out from behind a bush and yell "April Fools!" after all of those early peeks at the operating system, you're no doubt flabbergasted by the operating system's final form.But don't count Microsoft out too quickly. I didn't take Windows 8 very seriously until a few days ago either. But, during the course of writing this review, found my stubborn disdain turning into something else.Along with Windows 8 RTM, I had early access to two genuine Windows 8-based notebooks from Toshiba: the Satellite S955 and P845t. Between my time with those two laptops and installing Windows 8 on every x86-based platform I could find, I finally understand Windows 8, and I'm confident that I can explain it to you, too.Over the next 20 pages, we'll break down the Windows 8 UI, piece-by-piece in sometimes-sickening detail. We'll use the keyboard, mouse, and touch. We cover the installation and setup. We have the apps, the Store, and the settings. Then, we get into the "classic" desktop, following up with an exploration of how Windows 8 affects the traditional Windows experience. Plus, we show you how to either create synergy between Windows 8 UI and the desktop, or to ignore the new stuff altogether.Let's kick this story off by going over the vitals: system requirements, upgrade paths, available versions, and pricing.Google this week launched its Voter Information Tool, an online resource for information on this year's presidential election. On the site, users can locate their nearest polling place, as well as nearby early vote venues. The tool also includes information on voting rules and requirements, in addition to basic details on each presidential candidate, with links to their respective social media sites. The tool is essentially a revamped version of the US Voter Info site Google launched ahead of the 2008 presidential election, and, like its predecessor, is open source and easily embeddable.Googleâ€™s autonomous vehicle project uses a spinning range-finding unit, called lidar, on top of the car. It has 64 lasers and receivers.Used for lane-keeping and back-up assistance. Image-processing software can detect lane stripes, signs, stop lights, road signs and other objects.Used for adaptive cruise control. Reflected microwaves can identify location and speed â€” but not always type â€” of nearby vehicles.Global positioning system unit determines carâ€™s position. Accelerom- eters and wheel sensors help with naviga- tion when satellite signals are blocked.Used for assisted parking. Reflected sound waves detect distance to nearby objects. Some cars use short-range radar instead.The device creates a detailed map of the carâ€™s surroundings as it moves. Software adds information from other sensors and compares the map with existing maps, alerting the system to any differences.Sorry, but this area needs the Macromedia Flash Player - click here to download the latest versionRobots that kill. In the movies, this scenario is presented as a future in which things have gone terribly wrong. But, as revealed in the new Zoot Pictures documentary Remote Control War, such robots are no longer science fiction. Â From todayâ€™s CIA drone strikes to the next generation of armed autonomous robot swarms, killer robots are about to change our world. The question chillingly posed in Remote Control War is how this shift will affect not only warfareâ€¦.but mankind.Robotic war is already here. Every evening in Indian Springs, Nevada, an hour outside of Las Vegas, a group of ordinary-looking men and women say goodbye to their families and go to war. They fight insurgents in Afghanistan and on the mountainous borders of Pakistan. They watch, they bomb, and they kill. Sometimes their vehicles crash, but the pilots always go home to their families in the morning. They are remote control warriors.Remote Control War illustrates how warfare is being revolutionized in a monumental shift unlike anything in our human history. The current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan exemplify the worldâ€™s first Robotic War.Â  The American robotic fleet, almost non-existent when the US and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003, has today grown to number 7,000 robots in the air and 12,000 others on the ground.Â  Some 43 other countries, including Canada, are now using robots in combat.Military robots are appealing: they save soldiersâ€™ lives â€“ avoiding the negative publicity of planes repeatedly returning home with flag-shrouded coffins.But, as Remote Control War shows us, today's drones and robot tanks are like "the first horseless carriage" compared to new generations of robots already being developed. Robot warriors will soon move beyond taking directions - they will become autonomous, acting independently. Surveillance and other non-lethal tools will be turned into attack weapons, as the military reconfigures todayâ€™s R2-D2 and C-3PO into RoboCop and Terminator. We see in the film how this is already happening.Remote Control War producers Leif Kaldor and Leslea Mair of Regina-based Zoot Pictures (read an interview) hunt down the most up-to-date information on military robotics. They travel to Europe, Israel and across North America, gaining entry to the Pentagon, robotic production facilities and cutting-edge research laboratories. While discovering the latest technology, they pose the serious ethical questions we need to ask: When robots are used to kill human beings, what are the new rules of engagement?Robots only have the ethics with which they are programmed, and human/robot wars raise many ethical questions.Â  Does the ability to kill anyone, anywhere, using a robot, amount to lawlessness?Â  What happens when future robots can decide, on their own, whom to kill?Â  Would the military send out an autonomous swarm of micro-robots to kill an enemy?Â  Will having no casualties on your own side make going to war too easy a decision?The development and deployment of militarized robots also opens a Pandoraâ€™s Box. Currently, the West has the upper hand, but very soon, all sides will have access to remote control weapons.Â  In that frightening scenario, will robots become the futureâ€™s suicide bombers?To contribute to our understanding of what is going on right now in the world of military robotics, and the implications of these developments, Kaldor and Mair talk to such knowledgeable experts and insiders as:"This started as a documentary about military robots and ended up more like a science fiction film,â€? says Remote Control War director Leif Kaldor. â€œThe technology is almost unbelievable, yet very few people know there are thousands of robots on the battlefield right now, let alone what the next generation of lethal, autonomous robots will be capable of.â€?Kaldor adds: Â â€œWhen a leading roboticist tells you he wouldn't be worried if we had Terminators because heâ€™s far more concerned with the lethal, autonomous flying robot â€˜swarmsâ€™ that are being developed and tested right now, you know this is something weâ€™d better be aware of and talking aboutâ€¦.soon!â€?Produced by Leslea Mair and directed by Leif Kaldor for Zoot Pictures in association with CBC-TV.The feature that helps users avoid having to upload every song individually to Google's cloud will be offered free of charge to consumers, first in Europe and then in the U.S.Google announced plans today to roll out its version of a scan-and-match feature for the company's music service in Europe in two weeks and then in the United States soon after.The company was to announce the feature today, as well as other updates to Google Play entertainment media during a press event in New York that was supposed to mark the debut of the latest version of its Android operating system, according to multiple music industry sources. The search company cancelled the event due to Hurricane Sandy.Last month, CNET reported that Google was trying to obtain the licenses it needed to launch the service. Google said in a blog post that it will launch scan-and-match in Europe on November 13 and the United States soon after.Scan-and-match is the term used to describe a process whereby a user's music can be stored on the computer servers of a host service. The service can then stream songs over the Internet to the user's choice of Web-connected music players. The one deciding benefit of scan-and-match is that it saves the user from the time-consuming process of uploading each individual track to the host's servers.There's an arms race in online music to offer consumers cheaper music and more conveniences. Scan-and-match was one of the areas where Apple, Amazon, and Google were trying to one-up each other. Google certainly appears to have bested its competition in the area of price. The company said in the announcement that it would offer the scan-and-match feature free of charge to consumers.Last month, CNET reported that Google planned to offer the feature free. Apple and Amazon require a $25 annual fee for their versions of the feature. In addition to the news about scan-and-match, Google also said it was launching Google Play in Europe, and the company is offering customers the ability to buy movies -- rather than just rent -- in Canada, the U.K., France, Spain and Australia.In addition, the company has ended a year-long stalemate with Warner Music Group, one of the top three record companies. In October, when Google Music went live, it did so without that label's music.Updated at 9:30 a.m. PT to include Google's announcement on scan-and-match.Our lives are governed by centuries of advances that havenâ€™t been random, as mathematician and network scientist Samuel Arbesman argues thereâ€™s a pattern that reveals how our knowledge has changed over time.I had my first experience with the internet in the early 1990s. I activated our 300-baud modem, allowed it to begin its R2-D2-like hissing and whistling, and began to telnet. A window on our Macintoshâ€™s screen began filling with text and announced our connection to the computers at the local university. After exploring a series of text menus, I began my first download: a text document containing Platoâ€™s The Republic, via Project Gutenberg. After what felt like a significant fraction of an hour, I was ecstatic. I can distinctly remember jumping up and down, celebrating that I had this entire book on our computer using nothing but phone lines and a lot of atonal beeping.It took me almost a decade to actually get around to reading The Republic. By the time I did, the notion that I expressed wonder at such a mundane activity as downloading a text document seemed quaint. In 2012, people stream movies onto their computers nightly without praising the modem gods. We have gone from the days of early web pages, with their garish backgrounds and blinking text, to slick interactive sites with enough bells and whistles to make the entire experience smooth and multimedia based. No one thinks any longer about modems or the details of bandwidth speeds. And certainly no one uses the word baud anymore.The changes havenâ€™t ended there. To store data, I have used floppy disks, diskettes, zip discs, rewritable CDs, flash drives, burnable DVDs, even the Commodore Datasette. Now, I save many of my documents to storage thatâ€™s available anytime I have access to the internet: the cloud.The technological revolution weâ€™re currently experiencing is not a one-off, technology has been changing over the centuries. But whatâ€™s surprising is that if you look below the surface you discover that this progress is not random or erratic, it almost always follows a pattern. And understanding this pattern helps us to appreciate far more than faster download speeds or improved data storage. It helps us to understand something fundamental to our success as a species. It helps us to understand how our knowledge changes and evolves.In technology, the best-known example of this pattern is Mooreâ€™s Law, which states that the processing power of a single chip or circuit will double every year. Gordon Moore, a retired chemist and physicist as well as the co-creator of the Intel Corporation, wasnâ€™t famous or fabulously wealthy when he developed his law. In fact, he hadnâ€™t even founded Intel yet.In 1965, Moore wrote a short paper, entitled Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits, where he predicted the number of possible components placed on a single circuit for a fixed cost would double every year. He didnâ€™t arrive at this conclusion through exhaustive amounts of data gathering and analysis; in fact, he based his law on only four data points.The incredible thing is that he was right. This law has held roughly true since 1965; it has weathered the personal computer revolution, the march of processors from 286 to 486 to Pentium, and the many advances since then. While further data has shown that the period for doubling is closer to eighteen months than a year, the principle stands. Processing power grows every year at a constant rate rather than by a constant amount. And according to the original formulation, the annual rate of growth is about 200%.But when processing power doubles rapidly it allows much more to be possible, and therefore many other developments occur as a result. For example, the number of pixels that digital cameras can process has increased directly due to the regularity of Mooreâ€™s Law. This ongoing doubling of technological capabilities has even reached the world of robots. Rodney Brooks, a professor at MIT and a pioneer in the field, found that how far and how fast a robot can move goes through a doubling about every two years: right on schedule and similar to Mooreâ€™s Law.Copy and paste the code below:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/8131382839/" title="NASA Satellites See Sandy Expand as Storm Intensifies by NASA Goddard Photo and Video, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8475/8131382839_9c82cb8d3a.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="NASA Satellites See Sandy Expand as Storm Intensifies"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/8131382839/" title="NASA Satellites See Sandy Expand as Storm Intensifies by NASA Goddard Photo and Video, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8475/8131382839_9c82cb8d3a_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="NASA Satellites See Sandy Expand as Storm Intensifies"></a> [url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/8131382839/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8475/8131382839_9c82cb8d3a_t.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/8131382839/]NASA Satellites See Sandy Expand as Storm Intensifies[/url] by [url=http://www.flickr.com/people/gsfc/
