Their output runs the gamut, from shocking to silly.People are posting shots of deserted city centers, waterlogged streets, self-portraits in scuba gear and images borrowed from the apocalyptic film â€œThe Day After Tomorrow.â€?The easiest way to see many of the storm-related photos is through a site called Instacane that is pulling together all images that are tagged with terms like â€œSandyâ€? and â€œhurricane.â€?The site, according to Instagram, was originally created by two developers named Peter Ng and Chris Ackermann. It was first set up in August 2011 as a way to collect images related to Hurricane Irene.Last winter, people used Instagram to capture the blizzard that blanketed parts of the country, revealing a kaleidoscoped view of the storm, parsed into thousands of vantage points. But the service has grown tremendously over the last year, pushing past 100 million users and billions of photographs.Kevin Systrom, the founder and chief executive of Instagram, said via e-mail that there were 10 pictures a second tagged with â€œsandyâ€? flowing through the service. In total, more than 230,000 images are using that hashtag â€” but there could be more related to the storm.â€œMost are images of people prepping for the storm and images of scenes outdoors,â€? Mr. Systrom said. â€œI think this demonstrates how Instagram is quickly becoming a useful tool to see the world as it happens â€“ especially for important world events like this.â€?Instagram has played a role in other news events lately. Last month, an Instagram user saw, and photographed, an attempted suicide on the Brooklyn Bridge. And during the shooting at the Empire State Building in August, some of the first photographs from the scene appeared on Instagram. Although both instances prompted controversy online, Instagram and services like it feel especially valuable in an era when news is not always delivered first by the television but through social networks and the people on them.What are you really agreeing to when you click that fateful â€œagree button?Â Terms & ConditionsÂ cuts out the legal lingo to spell it out in plain English.First launched by Ohio University student Alan Schaaf in 2009, Imgur has become the de-facto picture hosting site for Reddit (and thus, tens of millions of reddit users). And for good reason: Itâ€™s simple, easy to use, and makes sharing links a breeze. Due to Facebookâ€™s nasty habit of swiping usersâ€™ photos for its own purposes, Iâ€™ve come to use Imgur as my go-to online photo storage bin. And so have many others â€” more than 55 million photos have been uploaded to Imgur over the past 30 days â€” a popularity that could increase thanks to a recent, social-centric update. Given Imgurâ€™s booming popularity, itâ€™s high time we put the photo-sharing site under some good olâ€™ T&C scrutiny. Here, a quick rundown of Imgurâ€™s terms of service and privacy policy.Because Imgur was made by a real Internet user (as opposed to some disconnected corporation), the terms of service are thankfully summed up at the beginning of the document, colored by language like, â€œDonâ€™t be a troll or a jerk.â€? Summing up terms in this way is wise, and I hope to see more companies following suit.That said, it is extremely doubtful that many Imgur users have ever clicked on the tiny â€œtermsâ€? link at the bottom of every Imgur page. So hereâ€™s the rest of what you need to know.What you canâ€™t doJust like every other service weâ€™ve covered here at T&C, Imgur forbids users to do a number of things. They are:If you do any of these things, or use Imgur to break the law in some other way, Imgur â€œwill ban you along with the site youâ€™re hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on Imgur.com.â€?All that talk of â€œno copyrighted imagesâ€? sounds good. But of course, itâ€™s mostly just there for show â€” Imgur is packed full of copyrighted images that were almost certainly not uploaded by whomever owns the intellectual property rights.That said, a good number of the most popular images uploaded to the site come directly from users. Which is why itâ€™s important to note that, by making an image publicly viewable on Imgur (you can set images and galleries to private if you wish), you are giving Imgur the right to do almost whatever it likes with that image. If you delete the image, or make it private, then Imgur immediately loses its rights to your image.Make sure to keep a backup of any photos you upload to Imgur â€” the company is not responsible, and cannot be held liable, if your pictures are somehow deleted from the companyâ€™s servers.Anytime you visit Imgur, the siteâ€™s servers collect various data about your computer. This includes:All of this data is with any comment you leave on a Imgur-hosted photo.Furthermore, like most other websites, Imgur makes money through advertising. And that means your activities on Imgur are, by default, being tracked by cookies, Web beacons, and other forms of traffic monitoring. This means some vague personal information is transferred to third-party advertisers. To block these cookies, Imgur recommends installing a tracker blocker plugin like PrivacyFix.And thatâ€™s pretty much it. Compared to most other Web legal documents, Imgurâ€™s terms and privacy policy are short, sweet, and without a lick of double-speak purposefully included to confuse users. Well done, Imgur. Well done.The Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Labs today powered up Titan, a new supercomputer with 299,008 CPU cores, 18,688 GPUs, and more than 700 terabytes of memory. Titan is capable of a peak speed of 27 quadrillion calculations per second (petaflops)â€”ten times the processing power of its predecessor at Oak Ridgeâ€”and will likely unseat DOE's Sequoia supercomputer (an IBM BlueGene/Q system at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) as the fastest in the world.Based on the Cray XK7 system, Titan consists of 18,688 computing nodes, each with an AMD Opteron 6274 processor and an NVIDIA Tesla K20 GPU accelerator. The NVIDIA GPUs provide most of the computing horsepower for simulations, with the Opteron cores managing them. True to its name, Titan is bigâ€”it takes up 4,352Â square feet of floorspace in ORNL's National Center for Computational Sciences.The combination of GPUs and CPUs dramatically reduces the electrical power consumption required to generate the computing power required. "Combining GPUs and CPUs in a single system requires less power than CPUs alone," said Jeff Nichols, ORNL's Associate Laboratory Director for computing and computational sciences. In his written statement on the launch, heÂ called Titan a "responsible move toward lowering our carbon footprint."Titan is an upgrade to Jaguar, a Cray XK6 system which as of June was the sixth fastest supercomputer in the world, drawing seven megawatts at its 2.3-petaflop peak performance. Titan will provide about 10 times that performance at nine megawatts. To achieve the same performance using solely Opteron CPUs, according to NVIDIA officials, Titan would have had to have been four times larger and would have consumed over 30 megawatts of power. The move to a hybrid CPU/GPU architecture is another step down the road toward "exascale" computing systemsâ€”with a goal of achieving 1,000 quadrillion (or 1 quintillion) computations per second.ORNL researchers have been preparing for the shift to Titan's hybrid architecture for the past two years as the upgrade from Jaguar was planned, and several projects are already set to run on the new architecture. James Hack, Director of ORNL's National Center for Computational Sciences, said "Titan will allow scientists to simulate physical systems more realistically and in far greater detail. The improvements in simulation fidelity will accelerate progress in a wide range of research areas such as alternative energy and energy efficiency, the identification and development of novel and useful materials and the opportunity for more advanced climate projections."Musician-turned-activist wants new SOPA-like law preventing search engines like Google from linking to Web sites where pirated music might be found.John Mellencamp, the rock musician turned political activist who jointly launched the Farm Aid concert series, has found a new cause: attacking Internet copyright law.Mellencamp says that U.S. copyright law should be rewritten to compel Google and other search engines to police Web pages they index -- that number in the billions -- and delete links to infringing Web sites.The musician, once known as John Cougar Mellencamp, wrote in an op-ed yesterday that:Mellencamp's Huffington Post op-ed calls for revising the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), saying "the law needs to be changed" to squash sites like "the brazen thieves" at The Pirate Bay: "We need to write a new law that should declare, something to the effect, that if you own and operate a search engine, you cannot allow criminal activity to take place in your virtual town."It echoes the same argument that the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America used last year when arguing that the DMCA was outdated and copyright law must be expanded. Their legislative effort, the Stop Online Piracy Act, was designed to make allegedly piratical Web sites virtually disappear from the Internet.But the MPAA and RIAA's lobbying efforts spectacularly failed in January when major Web sites went dark, millions of Internet users protested, and SOPA's sponsors backed away from their own bill. Even Microsoft, known for its aggressive views on expanding copyright law, got cold feet a year ago.SOPA said that Google and other search engines must, when receiving a legal order, "prevent the foreign infringing site that is subject to the order, or a portion of such site specified in the order, from being served as a direct hypertext link."That would be broader than what the DMCA allows, which is page-by-page takedowns, rather than yanking entire Web sites or domain names. That's more free-speech protective, because a Web site with some infringing portions can also be home to public domain or other non-infringing music or video files.For its part, Google says it receives 1.2 million requests per month to remove links to pages, with Microsoft being the most frequent complainant, followed by the RIAA and movie studios.It says it complies with 97 percent of the requests, which are submitted under a process created by the DMCA for the benefit of copyright holders -- a turbocharged takedown process not available to people who believe their privacy is violated by a YouTube video, for instance, or think a blog post is libelous or defamatory.In August, Google went beyond what the DMCA requires by announcing a new policy that penalizes sites that generate too many complaints from copyright owners. For YouTube, it's introduced an automatic infringement-identification system called Video ID, which also is not required by the DMCA.SAN FRANCISCO â€” I.B.M. scientists are reporting progress in a chip-making technology that is likely to ensure that the basic digital switch at the heart of modern microchips will continue to shrink for more than a decade.The advance, first described in the journal Nature Nanotechnology on Sunday, is based on carbon nanotubes â€” exotic molecules that have long held out promise as an alternative to silicon from which to create the tiny logic gates now used by the billions to create microprocessors and memory chips.The I.B.M. scientists at the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., have been able to pattern an array of carbon nanotubes on the surface of a silicon wafer and use them to build hybrid chips with more than 10,000 working transistors.Against all expectations, silicon-based chips have continued to improve in speed and capacity for the last five decades. In recent years, however, there has been growing uncertainty about whether the technology would continue to improve.A failure to increase performance would inevitably stall a growing array of industries that have fed off the falling cost of computer chips.Chip makers have routinely doubled the number of transistors that can be etched on the surface of silicon wafers by shrinking the size of the tiny switches that store and route the ones and zeros that are processed by digital computers.The switches are rapidly approaching dimensions that can be measured in terms of the widths of just a few atoms.The process known as Mooreâ€™s Law was named after Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, who in 1965 noted that the industry was doubling the number of transistors it could build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years.To maintain that rate of progress, semiconductor engineers have had to consistently perfect a range of related manufacturing systems and materials that continue to perform at evermore Lilliputian scale.The I.B.M. advance is significant, scientists said, because the chip-making industry has not yet found a way forward beyond the next two or three generations of silicon.â€œThis is terrific. Iâ€™m really excited about this,â€? said Subhasish Mitra, an electrical engineering professor at Stanford who specializes in carbon nanotube materials.The promise of the new materials is twofold, he said: carbon nanotubes will allow chip makers to build smaller transistors while also probably increasing the speed at which they can be turned on and off.In recent years, while chip makers have continued to double the number of transistors on chips, their performance, measured as â€œclock speed,â€? has largely stalled.This has required the computer industry to change its designs and begin building more so-called parallel computers. Today, even smartphone microprocessors come with as many as four processors, or â€œcores,â€? which are used to break up tasks so they can be processed simultaneously.I.B.M. scientists say they believe that once they have perfected the use of carbon nanotubes â€” sometime after the end of this decade â€” it will be possible to sharply increase the speed of chips while continuing to sharply increase the number of transistors.This year, I.B.M. researchers published a separate paper describing the speedup made possible by carbon nanotubes.â€œThese devices outperformed any other switches made from any other material,â€? said Supratik Guha, director of physical sciences at I.B.M.â€™s Yorktown Heights research center. â€œWe had suspected this all along, and our device physicists had simulated this, and they showed that we would see a factor of five or more performance improvement over conventional silicon devices.â€?Carbon nanotubes are one of three promising technologies engineers hope will be perfected in time to keep the industry on its Mooreâ€™s Law pace. Graphene is another promising material that is being explored, as well as a variant of the standard silicon transistor known as a tunneling field-effect transistor.Dr. Guha, however, said carbon nanotube materials had more promising performance characteristics and that I.B.M. physicists and chemists had perfected a range of â€œtricksâ€? to ease the manufacturing process.Carbon nanotubes are essentially single sheets of carbon rolled into tubes. In the Nature Nanotechnology paper, the I.B.M. researchers described how they were able to place ultrasmall rectangles of the material in regular arrays by placing them in a soapy mixture to make them soluble in water. They used a process they described as â€œchemical self-assemblyâ€? to create patterned arrays in which nanotubes stick in some areas of the surface while leaving other areas untouched.Perfecting the process will require a more highly purified form of the carbon nanotube material, Dr. Guha said, explaining that less pure forms are metallic and are not good semiconductors.Dr. Guha said that in the 1940s scientists at Bell Labs had discovered ways to purify germanium, a metal in the carbon group that is chemically similar to silicon, to make the first transistors. He said he was confident that I.B.M. scientists would be able to make 99.99 percent pure carbon nanotubes in the future.This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about an I.B.M. breakthrough on chip design defined incorrectly Mooreâ€™s Law, an observation on technology advances named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel. Mooreâ€™s Law holds that the chip industry doubles the number of transistors it can build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years â€” not intervals of about 12 to 18 months.Picture an eerily human-like tangle of metal, wiring and lights, cables dangling from somewhere above like puppet strings. Imagine it springing to life, lifting a long, lanky leg that bends 180 degrees at the hips like the eerie biomechanical GekkoÂ inÂ Metal Gear Solid 4, then placing one foot on a high bench and flexing its ankle, probing, testing, as it leans its thick cage of a torso forward, its arms splayed against plastic and wood walls on either side.And then itâ€™s up, hoisting its bulk into the air, its arms swinging forward just as yours or mine would, finding its feet, gently quaking, balancing.Now picture it leaping back down, landing first one foot, then the other, making a thunderous sound like someone swinging a sledgehammer at sheet metal (or the noise youâ€™d imagine a hulking robot might generate as it falls from above, like a BattleTech mech).Next â€” and you can see all this and more in the video above â€” itâ€™ll straddle a shallow pit teeming with deadly lizards and snakes (okay, just rubber ones, but still scary!) using both legs, edging past the gap fluidlyâ€¦Meet Pet-Proto, a Boston Dynamics-designed bipedal robot, related to the companyâ€™s anthropomorphic PETMAN project.Â Itâ€™s capable of analyzing and navigating complex obstacle courses, making decisions autonomously, and with, if not the actual dexterity of a human being, at least the functional semblance of one.Itâ€™s all part of DARPAâ€˜s (Defense Advance Research Projects Agency) work to promote its ambitious DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), which initiated its second phase on Wednesday, Oct. 24 since launching back in April. The contest will test the sort of capabilities illustrated above and others â€œinÂ a series of tasks that will simulate conditions in a dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environment.â€?â€œRobot enthusiasts, the time has come,â€? says DARPA on its website. â€œThe DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) begins today. Will you be part of it?â€?Itâ€™s just the start of whatâ€™ll amount to a two-year ordeal for teams competing to design, tweak and test rescue either humanoid or non-humanoid robots: ultra-agile, durable mechanical servants capable of going where most humans wouldnâ€™t dare, say exploring collapsed mines and helping to rescue trapped miners, defusing improvised explosive devices, or working around nuclear meltdown incidents like Fukushima, Chernobyl or Three Mile Island.The prize? A cool $2 million. All teams have to do is create robots that can perform tasks like: drive a utility vehicle, climb a wobbly industrial ladder, shatter a concrete wall using a power tool, cross a debris-littered field, isolate and close a valve in a leaking pipe and replace industrial equipment. Simple, right?If youâ€™re from the future, maybe, but todayâ€™s robots do almost none of these things â€” ergo DARPAâ€™s two-year challenge, designed to make some or all of the above a reality, and which as of Wednesday just got even more interesting.Take the newly announced Track C, which allows participants to compete without touching actual machine parts. Itâ€™ll involve using something DARPA calls its â€œDRC Simulator,â€? an open-source, cloud-based robotics design tool, and all you need to work it is a little software development know-how and an appetite for robotic simulation.â€œThe DRC Simulator is going to be one of DARPAâ€™s legacies to the robotics community,â€? says DRC program managerÂ Gill Pratt. â€œOne of DARPAâ€™s goals for the Challenge is to catalyze robotics development across all fields so that we as a community end up with more capable, more affordable robots that are easier to operate. The value of a cloud-based simulator is that it gives talent from any location a common space to train, design, test and collaborate on ideas without the need for expensive hardware and prototyping. That opens the door to innovation.â€?The DRC Simulator has only been in development for a month, according to DARPA, and its future already sounds bright, with a melange of improvements in the offing, including new â€œmodels of robots, perception sensors and field environmentsâ€? that should ultimately allow the simulator to â€œfunction as a cloud-based, real-time, operator-interactive virtual test bed that uses physics-based models of inertia, actuation, contact and environment dynamics.â€?What about Pet-Proto? As its name suggests, itâ€™s just a prototype â€” part of how DARPAâ€™s promoting the contest. Pet-Proto is really a predecessor to something theoretically more sophisticated that Boston Dynamics is working on, dubbed â€œAtlas.â€?DARPA says challenge participants selected to advance will receive Government Funded Equipment (GFE) â€œin the form of a modified robot platform based on the Atlas robot.â€? In other words, if you make it through the initial hurdles, you get to play with (and work on) something likeÂ that.This video is unlisted. Only those with the link can see it. Learn moreCompetition in the low-cost tablet space has been heating up for a while now thanks to strong new hardware from the likes of Asus, Google, and Barnes & Noble, but it seems the time has come for the Kindle Fire hucksters at Amazon to go on the offensive against a very prominent rival: Appleâ€™siPad mini.The company has recently given its homepage a facelift with a very prominent comparison between the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and the iPad mini sitting right at the top. Most of it is pretty tame and points out the disparity in features between the two tablets (ex. the Fire HD sports a higher resolution display and smarter speaker layout than the mini), but the kicker here is the quote Amazon used to drive its point home. Itâ€™s a brief snippet culled from a Gizmodo post by Brent Rose on Appleâ€™s perceived hypocrisy when it came to crafting a smaller tablet:For better or worse Amazon lopped off the beginning of that paragraph, which began with â€œAre. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me.â€? Sort of a shame, methinks â€” it wouldâ€™ve made Amazonâ€™s point that much stronger, though Iâ€™m pleased as punch to see Amazon allow such a prominent reference to balls on its front page.Itâ€™s hardly the first time that Amazon has sought to position its tablets as a strong competitor to the iPad â€” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos noted in an interview with AllThingsD that he felt the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD was â€œthe best tablet at any priceâ€? â€” but this move represents a considerable change in tone for Amazon. Then again, this sort of trash-talking seems to be quickly becoming par for the course in the industry â€” when Apple officially revealed the iPad mini earlier this month, SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller jabbed at smaller tablets (and Google and Asusâ€™s own Nexus 7 in particular) by basically crapping on the sorts of experiences that theyâ€™re capable of delivering.â€œOthers have tried to make tablets smaller than the iPad, and theyâ€™ve failed miserably,â€? Schiller noted on-stage.One has to wonder what exactly has prompted Amazon to go on the offensive, and it may be that surging sales momentum may have given the company a shot in the proverbial arm. According to a statement Amazon released on Friday, the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD enjoyed its biggest day of sales since launch on the same day that Appleâ€™s iPad mini announcement took place. It went on to note that sales for the Seattle companyâ€™s tablet lifted â€œ3x week over weekâ€? on the day of Appleâ€™s event, though exactly what that works out to in numbers is unclear since Amazon tends to be infuriatingly vague when it comes to concrete Kindle sales figures.With a season of unabashed consumerism nearly upon us, weâ€™ll soon see if Amazonâ€™s new approach to appealing to would-be tablet purchasers pans out. In the meantime, hereâ€™s a tip for anyone from Amazon who may be reading this â€” next time you need an feisty anti-iPad quote or five, you should spend some time checking out our comments section. Pure gold, Iâ€™m telling you.This video is unlisted. Only those with the link can see it. Learn moreThe Verge has learned that Google's Android event scheduled for Monday in New York Cityhas been canceled due to Hurricane Sandy. On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in response to the incoming storm, and Google's event was set to take place on a waterfront pier, which is now in an evacuation zone. Monday won't be a total loss, though: we'll be in San Francisco to cover Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 launch,which should be able to evade Sandy's wrath. It's the second time Google has postponed a launch event in recent memory â€” last year it moved its Ice Cream Sandwich event after the death of Steve Jobs. We'll keep you updated on Google's plans to reschedule, but in the meantime, grab your jackets and head somewhere dry.Update: Google provided the following statement about the event tomorrow:We are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more.Preface:Â  We hope and expect that the severity of the hurricane is being overblown, and that the nuclear plants in the Northeast will ride out the storm without any incident.We noted Friday thatÂ more than a dozen nuclear plants are near Hurricane Sandyâ€™s path.Nuclear expert Arnie GundersenÂ says that there are actuallyÂ 26 nuclear plants in the path of the hurricane, and that the spent fuel pools in the plants donâ€™t have backup pumps (summary viaÂ EneNews):EneNews alsoÂ reports that the hurricane is forecast to directly hit the Oyster Creek nuclear plant and that â€“ while the plant is currently shut down for refueling â€“ it still might very well have new, very hot fuel in the fuel pools:WithÂ Oyster Creek shut down for refueling starting last week, hot fuel may have been placed in the fuel pool quite recently. The unit at Oyster Creek is the same as Fukushima Daiichi No. 1: â€œOyster Creek is one of the oldest US nuclear plants and is the same design as Fukushima unit 1.â€?-SimplyInfoRemember, Fukushima reactor number 4 wasÂ shut down for maintenance when the Japanese earthquake hit.Â  And yet the fuel pools at reactor 4 are in such precarious condition that theyÂ pose aÂ giantthreat to humanity.(Ad) Depopulation is Not Left or Right, it Effects us All â€”Â LEARN MOREHurricane Sandy is not very intense in terms of wind speed.Â  But the storm is so large, that storm surges could beÂ 11 feet high.Obviously, the path of the hurricane could veer substantially, and may not hit Oyster Creek after all â€¦ weather forecasting is not an exact science.Â  But Gundersen argues that nuclear plants in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are in the most danger given current projections.As weÂ noted Friday, the Salem and Hope Creek plants in New Jersey are also near the path of the hurricane, as are the following plants in Pennsylvania:Another concern is the Millstone plant in Connecticut:EneNews summarizes the situation in a post entitled â€œOfficials in Connecticut warn of giant 16-foot storm surge, with 15-foot waveson top of that â€” Stateâ€™s nuclear plant directly exposed on oceanâ€œ:In a message sent to residents Sunday afternoon, [Norwalk, Connecticut] Mayor Richard A. Moccia warned of a 16-foot storm surge brought to land by Hurricane Sandy. [...] â€œI have declared a state of emergency in the City,â€? he said. â€œCoastal flooding from this event will peak at midnight on Monday night and will be worse than any flooding Norwalk has experienced in recent history. If you have ever experienced flooding before it is likely you will be flooded in this storm.â€? Moccia said that the storm will be equal to a Category 4 hurricane and will produce 16 foot storm surges. â€œThe mood during the meeting was tense as federal officials estimated a 13-foot storm surge for WestportÂ  [Connecticut] -â€“ 3 or 4 feet higher that the inundation from Storm Irene last year,â€? a news release said. â€œThis is an unprecedented storm,â€? said [First Selectman Gordon Joseloff], following his teamâ€™s briefing with federal and state disaster preparedness officials. â€œThis will be a storm of long duration, high winds and record-setting flooding. Take Storm Irene from last year and double it.â€? he said. [...] The town is bracing for at least three waves of flooding, beginning with the high tide at midnight Sunday, the announcement said. [... An] estimated 15-foot wind-driven waves [...] are expected on top of the storm surge. According to the Weather Channelâ€™s latest map, a 6 to 11 foot water level rise is forecast for the Connecticut coastline. This is theÂ highest increase of any area in the US. The stateâ€™s only nuclear power plant is located directly on the ocean, see marker â€˜Aâ€™ below:Millstone Power Station, Connecticutâ€™s sole nuclear plant, is focusing onÂ how best to guard against flooding and earthquakes to comply with tougher federal standards following the nuclear plant meltdown in Japan last year, the new chief of the power station said in an interview. Millstone isÂ assessing its ability to withstand flooding and â€œseismic events,â€? Stephen E. Scace, who took over as site vice president at Millstone in January, told The Associated Press on Thursday. He expects upgrades and installation of new equipment in the next three to four years.Join theintelhub.com FORUMS to Talk About Articles Like This One - ENTER NOWIn the last five weeks, Apple has revamped its entire product lineup with new iPods, iPhones and computers. But on Thursday it said those products would be more expensive to make, nibbling into its ample profits.That forecast for the holiday quarter was the main blemish on an otherwise solid financial report. Apple said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 24 percent, largely because of a surge in sales of the iPhone, a product that now accounts for nearly half of the companyâ€™s sales.The quarter ended Sept. 29 was the first to reflect sales of the iPhone 5, which was introduced Sept. 21. Apple has struggled to deliver enough of the devices to meet customer demand, making them tough to find in many retail stores. The companyâ€™s shares have fallen 9 percent since the product hit the market, in part because of investor concerns about short supply.In a conference call with analysts, Timothy D. Cook, Appleâ€™s chief executive, said that demand for the new iPhone was â€œextremely robustâ€? and that the company had a significant number of back orders for it. He said production had picked up substantially since earlier this month.The profit report was slightly below analystsâ€™ expectations, and Appleâ€™s stock was largely unchanged in after-hours trading. It fell 1.2 percent to $609.54 in regular trading.Underscoring how drastically Appleâ€™s business has been transformed by mobile products, revenue from the iPhone rose 56 percent to $17.13 billion, making up 48 percent of the companyâ€™s total revenue. It sold 26.9 million iPhones, 58 percent more than a year earlier.Apple said its net income was $8.22 billion, or $8.67 a share, compared with $6.62 billion, or $7.05 a share, a year ago. Revenue for the period rose 27 percent to $35.97 billion, and revenue for the full fiscal year was $156.5 billion. To put that in perspective, Appleâ€™s revenue for the year exceeded that of Microsoft, Google and Facebook combined.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Apple to report earnings of $8.75 a share and revenue of $35.8 billion. The results were well ahead of Appleâ€™s own forecast of $7.65 a share in earnings and $34 billion in revenue for the period.It was the companyâ€™s projections for its current holiday quarter that raised eyebrows among investors. The company forecast earnings of $11.75 a share and revenue of $52 billion for the period, typically its biggest of the year. That implied a gross profit margin of 36 percent, lower than the 40 percent margin Apple reported in the fourth quarter, said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners.Apple executives attributed the decline to higher costs associated with building its new products, which tend to get less expensive over time as Apple gets better at manufacturing them. While this pattern is familiar, the company said the sheer magnitude of its product-line overhaul made the decline in gross margin more severe. In addition to the new iPhone and iPods, Apple has announced new Macs and a smaller version of the iPad, called the iPad Mini.Mr. Cihra said the company might be lowballing its estimates. â€œThey have a history of beating their guidance,â€? he said.Apple said its revenue from the iPad rose 9 percent to $7.51 billion.As with most Apple products, the iPad Miniâ€™s arrival was widely anticipated after months of rumors and leaks about the product in the news media. Mr. Cook said the rumors led people to postpone tablet purchases.At the iPad Mini event, Apple hinted that sales of the iPad had been slower than expected when it revealed that the company had sold 100 million of the devices since their introduction two years ago, causing some analysts to trim their forecasts for the quarter.â€œI think on balance it was pretty in line with reduced expectations,â€? said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.At a starting price of $329, the iPad Mini is more expensive than many people were hoping, and well above the sub-$200 bar for smaller tablets set by Amazon and Google. But the device could still open the iPad to a new swath of customers who were put off by the larger size of the original.The wind map is a personal art project, not associated with any company.

Unlike its ASUS-made cousin, the new Nexus 10 was manufactured by Samsung with Google's input, and will be available for $399 (16GB) and $499 (32GB) when it goes up for sale on November 13.The tech in the new tablet is definitely top-shelf material: it features one of Samsung's new Cortex A15-based Exynos 5 chips clocked at 1.7 GHz, and its quad-core Mali-T604 GPU helps to drive a 10.055-inch PLS display with a resolution of 2560x1600. This 300 pixel-per-inch screen has four times the number of pixels in a 1280x800 screen and edges out the Retina iPad's 264 pixels per inch. The tablet's CPU should compare favorably to the Apple-designed CPU cores in its A6 and A6X processors, and the GPU should at least be playing in the same field as the A5X and A6Xâ€”we won't know for sure how they all shake out until we actually have hardware in-hand to test with.Other specs common to high-end Android tablets are also present: 2GB of RAM, storage capacities starting at 16GB, NFC, 802.11n, and Bluetooth 4.0. There are front and rear-facing cameras (at 1.9 and 5 megapixels, respectively). It also has a 9,000mAh battery that Google says is good for nine hours of use. Like the Nexus 7, it lacks a microSD card slot, so the amount of storage you buy with it is the amount that it's stuck withâ€”it does have micro USB and micro HDMI ports, however. It's also running the enhanced version of Jelly Bean, Android 4.2, and as part of the Nexus program should get prompt operating system updates for the foreseeable future.This tablet is the first-ever 10-inch tablet to bear the Nexus branding, but it's not the first 10-inch tablet to run stock Android and get prompt updates: the honor belongs to the Motorola Xoom, which Google and Motorola released to showcase Honeycomb in early 2011. We had mixed feelings about the Xoom in our original review, but we were more impressed when we re-reviewed it after its Jelly Bean update rolled outâ€”we called it "the right software in search of the right hardware," and as long as it doesn't inherit the chintzy, flexible plastic of Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1, the Nexus 10 might just be that hardware.Update: the original version of this article said that the Nexus 10 had a Super AMOLED display; it actually uses a plane-to-line switching (PLS) display.This was aired in either 1991 (according to trash0) or 1987-8 (according to Barry VK2FP).

Grier consists of a set of superimposed Bessel beamsâ€”beams which do not spread and are capable of self healing after partial obstructionâ€”which is able to push and pull tiny objects along its length.According to the project's abstract: "These optical conveyors have periodic intensity variations along their axes that act as highly effective optical traps for micrometer-scale objects."The duo's tractor beam is closer to the traditional science fiction concept of light-based transportation as it emits from a single source rather than relying on light from opposing points of origin to move the matter up and downstream. It is also reportedly more stable than other options:"Optical conveyors thus have the potential to out-perform optical tweezers, which cannot always achieve stable axial trapping," state Ruffner and Grier.While the current offering is only suited for moving microscopic particles, the team are already making suggestions to improve the mini tractor beam including improving speed of transportation by using a brighter conveyor and using higher order conveyors to transport oddly shaped objects.Right on schedule (ahem), Valve has begun requesting applications for the first Steam for Linux beta test.

The government believes it is unfair that Google (GOOG) receives advertising revenue from searches for news and may force the Internet giant to pay for the privilege of linking to its news sites. Google has threatened to remove all French news sites from its index, however, potentially eliminating 4 billion views per year. Eric Schmidt, the companyâ€™s chairman, is now reportedly planning on traveling to Paris next week to discuss the issue, according to Quartz. Fleur Pellerin, Franceâ€™s minister of technology, said that if Google can reach an agreement with French newspaper publishers, legislation would not be necessary.â€œWe donâ€™t want to appear as a country that is anti-Google,â€? Pellerin told Quartz. â€œObviously Google is a wonderful tool and Google is a major actor of the digital ecosystem. What I would suggest â€” and what Iâ€™m going to suggest to Google and to the press â€” is to start negotiating, to start discussions for maybe three months, and try to find an agreement on a negotiated basis. And if they donâ€™t, well weâ€™ll see.â€?LG Electronics bounced back to a profit in the third quarter on stronger-than-expected results from its handset division, which may be showing signs of turning around after several bumpy quarters.Overall the South Korean electronics conglomerate posted a net profit of around $142 million in the quarter, a major improvement over the loss of around $375 million the company posted in the year-ago period and beating analysts' estimates, according to Dow Jones Newswires. Total sales, however, fell 4 percent to $11.2 billion.It was the strong performance in LG's mobile division that stood out. The company's handset unit reported an operating profit of $19.02 million, up from an operating loss of $127 million in the year-ago period and $53.4 million in the second quarter. The handset unit posted sales of $2.07 billion, up 6 percent from the second quarter but down 9 percent year-over-year.Â LG shipped 14 million handsets in the quarter, better than the 13.1 million it had in the second quarter but down from the 21.1 million handsets it shipped in the third quarter of 2011. Still, LG said it is benefiting from higher sales of its LTE smartphones in South Korea, Japan and the United States. The company said that, despite increased expenses for marketing and R&D, the unit turned profitable "as a result of improved product mix and cost structure.""The biggest factor was their handset business returning to profit," Park Kang Ho, a Seoul-based analyst at Daishin Securities Co., told Bloomberg. "We thought their mobile business would at best break even. The overall product mix has improved and margins got better."LG, once the world's No. 3 handset maker, slipped to No. 5 in the second quarter. However, the company has been trying to shift to smartphones to increase its profitability and catch up to rivals like Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL)and Samsung Electronics.Â LG sold 7 million smartphones in the third quarter and expects smartphone shipments to grow in the fourth quarter, exceeding shipments of feature phones for the first time, LG CFO David Jung said, according to Bloomberg. "We're trying to step up our marketing efforts to make sure our product competitiveness will lead to revenue growth," he said.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, LG said it expects both increased consumer demand and competition as OEMs push out their flagship products for the holiday shopping season. LG said it will focus heavily on its high-end Optimus G and Optimus Vu 2 products. LG is also widely rumored to be building a Nexus-branded smartphone for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), called the Nexus 4, which reports have suggested Google will announce Oct. 29.By making a Nexus device, LG could be able to raise its profile at a time when it is trying to gain more support from U.S. carriers and bolster its brand. Verizon Wireless (NYSE:VZ) recently launched the $200 LTE-powered LG Intuition "phablet," LG's first device in the larger-than-a -smartphone-but-smaller-than-a-tablet category in the United States. Both AT&T Mobility (NYSE:T) and Sprint NextelÂ (NYSE:S) will launch the Optimus G, LG's 4.7-inch screenÂ smartphone that sports Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro quad-core processor. Further, T-Mobile USA said it will launch the Optimus L9 for $80, which is part of LG's "L-Series" of phonesÂ that run on Android 4.0 and sport a dual-core 1 GHz processor and 4.5-inch display."Today's results show that it doesn't have to be Appleor Samsung to make profits in smartphones," Hong Sung-ho, an analyst at I'm Investment & Securities, told Reuters."LG won't be able to earn double digit profit margin in handsets as Apple and Samsung do. Still, LG proved it has the potential to stand out among its second-tier peers of Huawei, ZTE, Motorola etc., with its manufacturing competitiveness."For more: - see this release - see this presentation (PDF) - see this Bloomberg article - see this Reuters article - see this WSJ article (sub. req.)Special Report:Â Wireless in the third quarter of 2012 Related Articles: Report: LG is working with Google on a Nexus smartphone Report: Google to expand Nexus device program to multiple OEMs LG to push high-end Optimus G to the U.S. in November LG unwraps quad-core, LTE Optimus G 'superphone' Verizon unveils LG Intuition phablet in challenge to Samsung's Galaxy Note LG posts Q2 loss in handset unit as sales drop LG struggles in Q3, pins hopes on LTE smartphonesCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- By the time the computer crimes office of the U.S. Secret Service discovered a problem Oct. 10, a foreign hacker had taken a database from the Department of Revenue's computers exposing 3.6 million Social Security numbers and 387,000 credit and debit card numbers, one of the largest computer breaches in the state or nation.The breathtaking breach has launched a high-stakes international criminal investigation and prompted South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose administration had another massive theft of confidential information at another cabinet agency earlier this year, to order an assessment of all the state's computer systems.Many questions remain unanswered. Officials are still unsure the state's system is entirely buttoned up. And investigators and the governor declined to answer any substantive questions about the investigation -- including whether the database may have been copied and whether taxpayers paid a ransom to the hacker to retrieve it.Haley administration officials, the State Law Enforcement Division and the Secret Service disclosed the breach publicly Friday, raising questions about why officials kept it shrouded in secrecy while the records of millions of the state's residents were nakedly exposed, and whether the system was now secure and whether taxpayers remain at risk.The breach, officials said, potentially affects anyone who has filed a South Carolina tax return since 1998. Even weeks into the investigation and during Friday's public unveiling of it, law enforcement investigators and Haley administration officials couldn't say who, or precisely how many, are at risk of having their identities stolen.All but 16,000 of the credit and debit cards, officials said, were encrypted -- meaning they were coded against being used by outside groups. But they said they don't know whether hackers could break the encryption. The remaining credit cards are so old, investigators said, that they don't believe they are at risk of being used.None of the Social Security numbers were encrypted and officials said they are studying whether they can do that -- raising other questions about whether safeguards exist that weren't used.Residents shocked"South Carolina has come under attack but South Carolina is going to fight back in every way possible to make sure every taxpayer is taken care of," said Haley.Taxpayers will bear the cost of fighting back. The state government is paying for the cost of the credit-protection service for millions of residents and the burden to taxpayers couldn't be determined by GreenvilleOnline.com on Friday.Reactions from taxpayers ranged from shock and concern to resigned eye-rolling about their government in Columbia. Some residents expressed doubt about whether state government is taking enough steps to safeguard sensitive personal information."It makes me question the state and how it was securing that kind of information," said Misha Morris, a recent Clemson graduate and Seneca, S.C., resident. "It's scary."Officials refused to go into details of what they have so far discovered about how the breach occurred and who was behind it, but said the August intrusion was basically a scouting mission by the hacker."To the best of our knowledge, it was kind of a look-see, what's here," said James Etter, director of the Department of Revenue. "They were not doing anything with the data in August. They got in, 'Now, let's see what we've got.' "Three more breaches followed -- the first, another "browse" on Sept. 3, Etter said, and then two more, concluding with the data theft on Sept. 13, Etter said.Authorities somehow discovered the intrusions on Oct. 10. A Secret Service agent, Mike Williams, said the agency's computer crimes office first uncovered the intrusion and notified state authorities.The Department of Revenue contacted a computer security firm recommended by the Secret Service -- Mandiant -- to "find and fix the leak."Outside expertsMandiant continues to work to determine what exactly was taken and whether numbers were stolen or just exposed."We're making great progress," said Marshall Heilman, director of the firm. "Those investigations are measured in weeks and months, not hours and days."State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel and the Secret Service's Williams refused to answer questions about the investigation in an exclusive interview with Gannett Co. Inc.'s GreenvilleOnline.com and WLTX in Columbia, which first received a tip about the breach, including the country where they believe the hacker resides."It would be inappropriate for me to comment," Keel said. "We have a very sensitive investigation. Obviously, we are making every effort that we can to bring someone to justice for this breach. And it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further."Public kept in the darkAsked why they didn't notify the public, Keel and Williams said they decided to notify the public after the investigation reached a series of "benchmarks." They said it was in the public's best interest that the investigation proceed further before public notification."We believed that during the course of the investigation that there were these benchmarks that if we could reach, we would do a better job of trying to protect the public," Keel said, declining to explain what the benchmarks were.South Carolina, like many states, doesn't operate a centrally controlled system. Instead, most of the 100 boards, agencies, universities and commissions operate their own systems that officials say complicates security measures.Taxpayers are being asked to call 1-866-578-5422 to determine whether their information is affected. The state will provide those affected with one year of credit monitoring and identify-theft protection, officials said.Greenville, S.C., resident Ashley Reynolds said she was relieved to hear about the credit monitoring and identity-theft protection being offered."It makes you sick. You just hear nightmares of people trying to recover from identity theft," she said. "It can be years of trying to reclaim your good status."But names can never hurt meMy bf is working in Abu DhabiI hope you get your wish.

But before I left ...and I never saw his nick on Undernet again, but that doesn't mean anything, there are typically 50,000 people on Undernet at any given moment. But I never saw Ygor again.What hurts the most are the vile threats and insults hurling back and forth through the Chat-o-Sphere in times of war. It's still much better than the actual warbut there is a huge volume of particularly ugly hatred especially reserved for Peace Assholes like me. A Hezbollah guy would rather French-kiss an Israeli soldier than read Peace Crap from anybody, and ditto the feelings of an IDF soldier.Once war starts, it's like when sex starts -- nobody wants it interrupted or stopped. It just feels so good, you want it to just go on and on and on and on and on. Peace doesn't offer any emotions that feel nearly as good.Peace is complicated and confusing. Israeli Jews will have to learn how to be day-to-day neighbors with Palestinian and Arab Muslims. Hezbollah will have to learn how to be day-to-day neighbors with Lebanese Christians and Druse. Shia and Sunni will have to go shopping for groceries at the same market, without firearms. I'm not joking when I say that's going to be incredibly hard.War is simple and easy. It's so easy that the United Nations is trying to make every country and combatant on Earth stop using Child Soldiers younger than 16. Without much success. The government of Sri Lanka was just accused of using Child Soldiers, a nasty rap previously reserved for the Tamil Tigers. In Africa, the Lord's Resistance Army usually wins the prize for accusations of abducting children to be soldiers and sex slaves. The Lord's Resistance Army is a religious movement, and teaches the child soldiers that if they believe, enemy bullets cannot harm them.But war is so easy that little boys make excellent soldiers, and little boys and girls make excellent sex partners for older soldiers. You don't need to be mature to be an effective soldier; in fact maturity usually just gets in the way.Tonight's Relapse ... well, I really didn't want any war or any politics or any anger or any flame wars.

Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., have been able to pattern an array of carbon nanotubes on the surface of a silicon wafer and use them to build hybrid chips with more than 10,000 working transistors.Against all expectations, silicon-based chips have continued to improve in speed and capacity for the last five decades. In recent years, however, there has been growing uncertainty about whether the technology would continue to improve.A failure to increase performance would inevitably stall a growing array of industries that have fed off the falling cost of computer chips.Chip makers have routinely doubled the number of transistors that can be etched on the surface of silicon wafers by shrinking the size of the tiny switches that store and route the ones and zeros that are processed by digital computers.The switches are rapidly approaching dimensions that can be measured in terms of the widths of just a few atoms.The process known as Mooreâ€™s Law was named after Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, who in 1965 noted that the industry was doubling the number of transistors it could build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years.To maintain that rate of progress, semiconductor engineers have had to consistently perfect a range of related manufacturing systems and materials that continue to perform at evermore Lilliputian scale.The I.B.M. advance is significant, scientists said, because the chip-making industry has not yet found a way forward beyond the next two or three generations of silicon.â€œThis is terrific. Iâ€™m really excited about this,â€? said Subhasish Mitra, an electrical engineering professor at Stanford who specializes in carbon nanotube materials.The promise of the new materials is twofold, he said: carbon nanotubes will allow chip makers to build smaller transistors while also probably increasing the speed at which they can be turned on and off.In recent years, while chip makers have continued to double the number of transistors on chips, their performance, measured as â€œclock speed,â€? has largely stalled.This has required the computer industry to change its designs and begin building more so-called parallel computers. Today, even smartphone microprocessors come with as many as four processors, or â€œcores,â€? which are used to break up tasks so they can be processed simultaneously.I.B.M. scientists say they believe that once they have perfected the use of carbon nanotubes â€” sometime after the end of this decade â€” it will be possible to sharply increase the speed of chips while continuing to sharply increase the number of transistors.This year, I.B.M. researchers published a separate paper describing the speedup made possible by carbon nanotubes.â€œThese devices outperformed any other switches made from any other material,â€? said Supratik Guha, director of physical sciences at I.B.M.â€™s Yorktown Heights research center. â€œWe had suspected this all along, and our device physicists had simulated this, and they showed that we would see a factor of five or more performance improvement over conventional silicon devices.â€?Carbon nanotubes are one of three promising technologies engineers hope will be perfected in time to keep the industry on its Mooreâ€™s Law pace. Graphene is another promising material that is being explored, as well as a variant of the standard silicon transistor known as a tunneling field-effect transistor.Dr. Guha, however, said carbon nanotube materials had more promising performance characteristics and that I.B.M. physicists and chemists had perfected a range of â€œtricksâ€? to ease the manufacturing process.Carbon nanotubes are essentially single sheets of carbon rolled into tubes. In the Nature Nanotechnology paper, the I.B.M. researchers described how they were able to place ultrasmall rectangles of the material in regular arrays by placing them in a soapy mixture to make them soluble in water. They used a process they described as â€œchemical self-assemblyâ€? to create patterned arrays in which nanotubes stick in some areas of the surface while leaving other areas untouched.Perfecting the process will require a more highly purified form of the carbon nanotube material, Dr. Guha said, explaining that less pure forms are metallic and are not good semiconductors.Dr. Guha said that in the 1940s scientists at Bell Labs had discovered ways to purify germanium, a metal in the carbon group that is chemically similar to silicon, to make the first transistors. He said he was confident that I.B.M. scientists would be able to make 99.99 percent pure carbon nanotubes in the future.This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about an I.B.M. breakthrough on chip design defined incorrectly Mooreâ€™s Law, an observation on technology advances named for Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel. Mooreâ€™s Law holds that the chip industry doubles the number of transistors it can build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years â€” not intervals of about 12 to 18 months.Google is now in the same-day delivery business. In San Francisco, some people affiliated with Google can buy a product, using their phones or computers, and have it delivered to their homes in a matter of hours.Plans for the new service have been under way for more than a year. But it recently went live for some Google employees and their friends, according to two people briefed on the service who were not authorized to discuss it because Google has not yet publicly introduced it. At least one national apparel chain is involved, one of these people said. A Google spokesman, Nate Tyler, declined to comment.Google is just one company tackling same-day delivery. So are Wal-Mart Stores, Amazon.com, eBay and the United States Postal Service.Though the service propels Google into commerce, the company does not intend to operate warehouses or a shipping service but to team up with retailers and delivery companies. Several San Francisco retailers, including national chains, are participating in the program already.For shoppers, the service means they can avoid the trouble of driving to the store and some of the wait for items ordered online.Same-day delivery could help physical retailers, which have been under siege from e-commerce companies that offer the convenience of shopping without leaving home. But online retailers offering same-day delivery could make life even harder for physical retailers, because letting people own something the same day has become physical retailersâ€™ biggest remaining advantage.The reasons that Google is interested in same-day delivery are less obvious.Retail ads are a huge portion of Googleâ€™s business, but they are under threat from companies like Amazon, where shoppers increasingly go to search for products, bypassing Google. Also responding to the threat from Amazon, Google recently tried to improve its comparison shopping service by charging retailers to list their products there. It says retailers are more likely to list accurate and up-to-date items if they are paying.Additionally, Google has been trying to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds to better understand and profit from mobile ads. On computers, Google and advertisers know if a user clicks on an ad and visits or buys on another Web site. But they lose track of customers who look up a business or product on their phone and then put their phone away, walk into the store and buy something. Online ordering and delivery could help solve that problem.Scan this on your phone to join in with MMO BATTLE TANKS!MinecraftÂ isÂ the breakout indie game that combined simple game mechanics with an immersive, 3D sandbox experience.

The company has confirmed to us that it's postponing the event to an as yet undetermined point in the future due to Hurricane Sandy, whose East coast arrival will follow so closely before the New York City gathering that Google isn't willing to take the chance on its big day. If you're experiencing a sense of dÃ©ja vu, you're not alone -- Google delayed last year's event revealing the Galaxy Nexus out of respect for the late Steve Jobs. While it's not what we'd call an auspicious start to Google's holiday launches, we can at least hope for an abundance of riches when the company is ready once again. The full statement waits below."We are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more."Maybe youâ€™ve already heard this, but I recently got a Kindle Paperwhite, my first e-reader. This was a big deal for me, and a decision which involved a lot of hand-wringing. Iâ€™m a lifelong avid reader, book lover, and collector, so for me, reading isnâ€™t just about inhaling information. I like the way books smell and feel, and I like physically turning pages. But when Amazon announced the Kindle Paperwhite, it seemed the right moment to me: e-readers had finally progressed far enough that I could feel something other than dread about owning one, and, at least for traveling, I thought Iâ€™d find it to be useful. Of course, I was still worried.Iâ€™m happy to report that most of the things I was worried about arenâ€™t as serious as Iâ€™d thought they might be. Sure, sometimes I miss holding a book, but mostly Iâ€™ve adjusted just fine, and have found that the conveniences of the Kindle far outweigh the relatively tiny (but nagging) preferences Iâ€™ve built up over many, many years of reading. In fact, my experience over the last three weeks has been far better than expected. Except for one thing: ebooks are apparently lousy with typos. This is not a minor issue, and it doesn't seem to be an isolated one, either.Though Iâ€™ve only had the Kindle for three weeks, Iâ€™ve noticed that the book Iâ€™ve been reading, Foucaultâ€™s Pendulum, has many typos. This isnâ€™t an out-of-copyright, cheaply made book from a fly-by-night press. This is marketed and published as a 2007 edition of the 1988 book by Mariner, an imprint of Houghton Mifflin. Its list price is $15.95, and it costs $8.77 on Amazon. Many of the typos â€” the letter "c" in place of what should be an "e" â€” appear to be the casualties of a hasty OCRing of some actual text of the work. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a process of scanning a book and using software which recognizes the scanned words as words, rather than merely as images, converting the images into text files. Anyone who has ever used OCR software knows that the process is far from perfect and always demands a serious attention to detail in the copy editing phase, once scanning is done, because the software doesnâ€™t "read" the text perfectly. This seems to be at least partially what is happening in my Kindle edition of Foucaultâ€™s Pendulum, and itâ€™s unacceptable.Iâ€™ve found other typos in other books too, but statistics on this are hard to come by, and since Iâ€™ve only been using an e-reader for a few weeks, I donâ€™t have much history to go on. But Iâ€™ve asked around a lot and everyone Iâ€™ve talked to since noticing this shocking fact has basically said the same thing: in their experience, theyâ€™ve seen more typos in ebooks than in their printed counterparts.Now, I can tell you that typos in most mainstream printed books are fairly rare. Occasionally, Iâ€™ll see one, but rarely two: itâ€™s just not that common. Iâ€™ve got a good number of old pulp fiction paperbacks at my house, original Philip K. Dicks published by Ace, and typos are sometimes more common in those, with good reason: they were produced on a smaller budget than the bigger, literary publishing houses were working with. In general, typos betray a hasty and cheap You enter and arc stunned by a conspiracy...editing process, and have historically been found in the less reputable, or less well-financed, companies. It has nothing in common with the quality of the work, but typos make the reader feel like the writer or publisher doesnâ€™t care â€” which is pretty much rarely true, as far as I can tell. It also pulls you out of the story, drawing your attention to the typo, rather than the words: "You enter and arc stunned by a conspiracy..." But Foucaultâ€™s Pendulum is a major work by a living author, released by a major publisher. The publisher also undertook the lengthy and expensive process of having the book translated from Italian. And yet the ebook is riddled with issues: in the 90 or so pages since I started marking typos with notes, Iâ€™ve found 16; a cursory search for the word "arc" (instead of "are") turns up 18 examples, and as far as I can tell only three of them should actually be the word "arc."To be clear, this isnâ€™t exactly an Amazon problem: I bought the same book from iBooks and it reproduces most of the same errors (though not quite all of them, someone appears to have caught some). But, as the biggest player in the ebook game, it would be great to see Amazon be a leader here, and give publishers and readers alike better options for reporting and fixing issues with ebooks. Because Iâ€™ll be honest: this could be a dealbreaker for me. Oh, I know that Foucaultâ€™s Pendulum seems to be a worse case than most ebooks, but it is completely intolerable.Now, I donâ€™t have an insiderâ€™s perspective on ebook publishing, but my understanding (Iâ€™ve contacted both Amazon and Apple for comment) is that while Apple does allow publishers to push updates to their ebooks, Amazon does not, meaning that if there are typos in a work, theyâ€™ll always be there until a fully new edition is published. An Amazon spokesperson told me that readers can report typos in the "Feedback" section of a bookâ€™s details, but the only option is literally to report that a book "has typos." The Kindle app for desktop, the Paperwhite, and the Kindle Touch have the additional functionality of being able to highlight the word and specify the type of error, but it's unclear how those reported errors are dealt with. It seems that pushing updates to ebooks isn't a simple or quick process. Believe me, Iâ€™m dying to report specific typos, and I think this is one scenario where Believe me, I'm dying to report typoscrowdsourcing could be helpful, but so far, itâ€™s just not happening. Amazon in particular, with its shared notes features, seems to have all the pieces in place which would allow some type of real reporting and correction system to work. This seems completely insane to me â€” the technology should allow us to move fairly quickly on pushing updates of minor typos for new purchasers of a book. This should be one of the great advances of ebooks: that if the printer makes a mistake, everyone doesnâ€™t have to live with it until they sell through a million copies or whatever. Instead, Iâ€™m needlessly looking at typos that surely thousands of other people have seen in the past few years, and which Mariner is certainly aware of at this point (Iâ€™ve emailed them for comment). Appleâ€™s recent announcement of a new version of iBooks seems to include better options for publishers to push updates to their ebooks, and this is a start.The reality is, however, that publishing is changing very fast, and to keep up with that pace, publishers are moving quickly to get their books into stores like Amazon and iBooks. Thatâ€™s great, I want as much content available as possible. But I also demand, and believe that all readers should demand, the high quality that book publishers have always offered to their customers. We can assume that this won't be a problem with most new books, because printed and digital versions will be created simultaneously from the same master text... unless publishers actually get lazy. But most books aren't brand new, and if the convenience of an e-reader must bring with it an acceptance of shoddily produced and edited versions of books, then count me out.This article has been updated to clarify the typo reporting process based on a conversation with Amazon.(Don't worry, folks! The SDK is included in the Early Bird perk!)Â Introducing Muse, our brainwave-sensing headband.It's a comfortable, sleek, four-sensor headband that allows you to control applications, games, reduce stress, improve memory and concentration, and eventually control devices directly with your mind. Â Muse measures your brainwaves in real-time. It sends those brainwaves to your smart phone or tablet showing you how well your brain is performing and also translates your brainwaves into instructions to interact with content on your iOS or Android device.The neat thing is every time you use your brain with Muse and one of our applications, youâ€™re strengthening it. Â And that will let you do more with your mind than you ever thought possible.The Muses were ancient Greek goddesses of Art and Science who inspired genius and creativity in mortalsYour brain creates brainwave activity every moment of your life, day and night, awake or asleep. Each state is accompanied by specific brain wave patterns. For example, brains of people in relaxed states create gentle, slow-moving alpha waves, while those engaged in intense concentration generate quick, jaggedÂ beta waves.This brainwave data may look like itâ€™s just couple of squiggly lines, but our algorithms (and our developers) see a wealth of informationMuse uses sensors to pick up the tiny electrical outputs generated by your brainâ€™s activity. Â As you shift Â between states like concentration and relaxation, Museâ€™s algorithms detect the subtle changes in your brain and show you those changes in real time, just like a heart rate monitor can provide information about your physical activity.Â These signals can be used in a number of ways. Right now, you can see your brainwaves in action and use that information to improve and strengthen your mind. Â In the future, InteraXon is looking to use these brainwaves to interact with devices in the real world--devices that respond to your thoughts like turning off your smart phone when you are asleep or turning off the TV.Muse sits across your forehead like a headband, and rests behind your ears like a pair of glasses. When properly worn, the EEG (electroencephalography) sensors on the front of the band make contact on your forehead, and the reference sensors on the arms rest on the backs of your ears. Muse connects wirelessly to your devices via Bluetooth. Once Muse is on, youâ€™ll hardly notice it at all.Weâ€™re including our first in-house application with Muse: Â our Integrated Brain Health system. Â It will guide you through a series of lessons delivered in beautiful virtual environments on your phone or tablet. Â Run through some exercises to sharpen your mind before delivering a speech. De-stress and detox your mind on the train ride home. Flood your brain with alpha waves and embark on a five-minute mental vacation.Itâ€™s filled with fun, interesting and challenging exercises to help you build health brain habits such as: better attention skills, improving your memory, reducing anxiety, building a more positive attitude and staying motivated. Â Our brain training integrates cognitive and emotional exercises because we believe a healthy brain needs both to perform at its best.Â This illustration of a focus training app shows howÂ brainwave data can help you track your progress over timeWe decided to introduce this application with Muse because of discussions we had with people about their attempts to improve their mood and build a more positive outlook and the growing number of stress-related illnesses. Â  The problem most people had was a lack of helpful, real-time feedback to know whether what they were doing was working. People simply didnâ€™t know whether they were doing the exercises right. Lacking direction and guidance, itâ€™s no wonder most gave up.Â Despite best efforts, most people run into numerous stumbling blocks and eventually give up on trying to change the negative ways they think. Â The problem most had - developing practices to sustain concentration, relaxation, increase motivation, and maintain composure in stressful situations, among other things - was a lack of helpful, real-time feedback to know whether what they were doing was working. People simply didnâ€™t know, whether they were getting closer to their goals or if they were performing the techniques right at all! Lacking direction and guidance, itâ€™s no wonder most gave up.This was the â€œA-ha!â€? moment for our first application.With our background in brain-computer interfaces, we saw how EEG could provide meaningful and timely feedback to help people get past the usual stumbling blocks. Â So weâ€™ve been working with experts who teach mental practices fusing their methods and our technology into gorgeous, compelling digital experiences for your iPad, iPhone, or Android device.Â A personal tracking app, like the one in this concept illustration could let you track your brainstate throughout the dayInteraXon is an interdisciplinary team of artists & engineers, neuroscientists & designers.

And all of that knowledge is built into Muse.Â Our first ever tin-foil hat day was a big success.Other people working on EEG spend most of their time thinking about the technology. At InteraXon, weâ€™re constantly thinking about ground breaking solutions that make sense in everyday life for people just like you. Itâ€™s this focus that we think is going to make all the difference to you.In 2010, we partnered with Secret Exit to make a brainwave- powered version of the award-winning ZenBound 2 (click image for video!)We want Muse to be an everyday part of your life so we crafted it to be as attractive, comfortable, light and intuitive as possible. We develop applications that address real life scenarios providing real life benefits, while also developing applications that inspire, educate and entertain.Muse is here to be the guide to the wonders of brainwave-enabled technology for people all over the world.

And only about a third - 35% - of the people who had heard about the new system believed it would be an improvement.Engineer Chris Dionne, 43, of Waterbury, Connecticut, had already seen Windows 8 and it did not persuade him to abandon or upgrade his laptop running on Windows 7, the previous version of the operating system released in 2009."I am not real thrilled they are changing things around," he said. "Windows 7 does everything I want it to. Where is the return on my investment to learn a new OS (operating system)?"Microsoft usually releases a new version of Windows every two or three years, but it is different this time around.Windows 8 is the most radical redesign of the operating system since 1995 and some analysts consider the software to be Microsoft's most important product since co-founder Bill Gates won the contract to build an operating system for IBM's first personal computer in 1981.Microsoft is hoping the way Windows 8 looks and operates will appeal to the growing number of people embracing the convenience of smartphones and tablets.The consumer ambivalence, however, was even more pronounced when it came to Microsoft's new tablet computer, Surface, which was built to show off Windows 8's versatility.Sixty-nine per cent of the poll's respondents expressed little or no interest in buying a Surface, which Microsoft is hoping will siphon sales from Apple's pioneering iPad and other popular tablets such as Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7.The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), enacted by Congress after the abuses of the 1960s and 70s, regulates the governmentâ€™s conduct of intelligence surveillance inside the United States. It generally requires the government to seek warrants before monitoring Americansâ€™ communications. In 2001, however, President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to launch a warrantless wiretapping program, and in 2008 Congress ratified and expanded that program, giving the NSA almost unchecked power to monitor Americansâ€™ international phone calls and emails.On October 29, the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether plaintiffs represented by the ACLU have the right to challenge the constitutionality of the law.Less than an hour after President Bush signed the 2008 amendments, the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the lawâ€™s constitutionality. The case, Amnesty v. Clapper, was filed on behalf of a broad coalition of attorneys and human rights, labor, legal and media organizations whose work requires them to engage in sensitive and sometimes privileged telephone and e-mail communications with individuals located outside the United States.In 2009, a judge in New York dismissed the suit on the grounds that the ACLUâ€™s clients couldnâ€™t prove that their communications would be monitored under the new law. A federal appeals court reversed that ruling in 2011 and the Obama administration has now asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.You can view the court filings here.Learn more about the plaintiffs in the ACLUâ€™s challenge to the 2008 FISA Amendments Act>>July 2008: The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 is signed into law by President Bush.

While we realize that's not the intention of this section, this must be clarified."You may remember that, a year ago, Pakistan announced they were banning encryption online. Not that any such ban would likely to be effective, but it seems to fit in with the claim that the government has told PTCL, the Pakistani telco, that within 90 days it must monitor basically all communications that go across the Pakistani border:Yeah, sure, just to "curb blasphemous and obscene websites." I'm sure all that monitoring won't be abused otherwise at all... right? Somehow, despite that earlier ban, I'm guessing that encryption technologies just became a lot more popular in Pakistan.January this year the U.S. Government destroyed Megaupload, but founder Kim Dotcom is a not done with the file-hosting business yet and is preparing a comeback with something bigger and better. Over the past months a group of coders have been working hard on the new â€œMegaâ€? venture and Dotcom announced today that the raid-proof service will launch exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down.With 50 million visitors per day at its peak, Megaupload was one of the largest websites on the Internet.This abruptly ended January this year when the U.S. Government took down the file-hosting service and had several key employees arrested including founder Kim Dotcom.Despite ongoing criminal proceedings Dotcom and his team are determined to launch a new Megaupload, which will simply be called â€œMegaâ€?.Initially the new Mega was expected to launch in 2012, but according to the latest information the launch is now scheduled for January 19 2013, exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down.â€œThe new Mega will launch exactly 1 year after the raid,â€? Dotcom announced a few hours ago, adding that thereâ€™s a Doomsday launch button in place, a reference to the device U.S. authorities claimed could have been in place to self-destruct the old Megaupload in the event of a raid.Previously Dotcom said that the coding work for the new Megaupload was nearly finished and that the servers had been ordered. Investors are lining up to join the new venture that Dotcom has described as a â€œmassive global network.â€?â€œAll non-US hosters will be able to connect servers & bandwidth,â€? he explained.According to Dotcom we can expect a Mega with an even greater range of applications than just file-sharing. Developers of file managers are being encouraged to get in touch for early API access, and Dotcom is also calling out to those involved in email and fax tools, VOIP and video apps.For users the new Mega will also mean more security. Uploaded files will be encrypted using the AES algorithm. Users will then be provided with a unique decryption key giving them sole responsibility for who can have future use of their files.Former Megaupload users who expect â€œMegaâ€? to give them access to their old files will be disappointed. While Megaupload is trying to convince the court to help users retrieve their old files, the new Mega is going to start from scratch.One detail that still remains a secret is the domain name the new Mega will be operating on. Megaupload.com remains seized and is therefore unavailable.Dotcom told TorrentFreak that he hasnâ€™t made a definite choice for a domain yet. He did register a few options this summer that would be fitting for the new service, and his other upcoming project Megabox.Whatever the choice turns out to be, January 19 is going to be an eventful date once again.The BBC and Deutschlandradio have joined forces to support the rollout of a single, universal chip to enable radios to receive multiple broadcasting standards across Europe.The move aims to tackle uncertainty in the market and create a 'future proof' design with enough volume to bring costs down dramatically. The 'Euro-Chip' is an existing set of minimum features and functions, originally created by WorldDMB, for all new digital radio receivers. It ensures the interoperability of all new digital radio receivers in European countries where broadcasters are using DAB, DAB+ or DMB, and/or analogue AM and FM. "Digital radio across Europe has been plagued by uncertainty," said Tim Davie, Director of Audio and Music at the BBC. "We may be reaching a tipping point, but first we have to bank what is certain about radio's digital hybrid future and join forces to promote a common vision across Europe." "Digital radio is a technology invented in Europe and we as broadcasters in Europe can show that we are able to work together to assure the future of radio," said Willi Steu, Director-General of Deutschlandradio (left) "This is of critical importance for broadcasters, manufacturers and the public," said Nyberg Frankenhaeuser, Media Director of the European Broadcasting Union. "We must ensure that European consumers are able to buy future-proofed receivers that will provide them with radio services across Europe." Chip makers for DAB and DMB include Frontier Silicon (now part of Toumaz Technologies) using designs from Imagination Technologies, and Panasonic. www.ebu.chChipmaker AMD is looking for a partner to help revive its flagging fortunes and help build some kick-ass server chips. And we think that partner is going to be ARM, the U.K. design shop thatâ€™s best known for coming up with the brains of the iPhone.Next Monday, the day before ARMâ€™s annual developer conference kicks off in Santa Clara, California, AMD is gathering CEO Rory Read and an unnamed â€œspecial guestâ€? together to talk about something it calls its â€œambidextrous strategy.â€?AMD first floated this ambidextrous strategy idea at its financial analyst meeting back in February. Essentially, it means that the company wants to license other companiesâ€™ intellectual property and work that into its chip designs. The problem is that AMD hasnâ€™t said a lot about exactly whose designs itâ€™s considering. Back in February, we asked AMD CTO Mark Papermaster flat out if he was going to do an ARM-based chip. His response? â€œThe answer is not no.â€?Since that meeting AMD has indeed taken out an ARM license â€” for a very basic chip design called the Cortex-A5. Itâ€™s using this to develop some new security capabilities for its future client chips, but we guess that next weekâ€™s announcement is going to be about servers, and about a different, server-friendly ARM design called ARMv8.ARM is starting to look like like a pretty neat fit with the server room. ARMâ€™s chips are so power efficient, theyâ€™ve already bested Intel in the mobile phone market. So maybe the companies that license ARMS designs could make a go of it in the server space, where Intelâ€™s high-wattage Xeon chips are now king?To date, ARM has been missing some key features that server-room geeks really need. Most importantly, ARMâ€™s chips donâ€™t work well in computers that have more than 4 gigabytes of memory. Servers are memory hogs, so AMD and Intel moved their most popular server microprocessors to 64-bit designs about a decade ago, but ARM is now catching up. And next year, the first ARM licensees will start shipping 64-bit chips based on the V8 design.Last spring, ARMâ€™s Simon Segars told us that he sees the V8 being ideal for a certain class of very popular web applications â€” serving video or search results, for example â€” that would work fine with the low-power ARM designs. There â€œis a potential for 90 percent power saving by adopting this type of approach,â€? said Segars, the general manager of ARMâ€™s Processor and Physical IP Divisions. â€œSo the prize is potentially very big.â€?If AMD joins companies like Calxeda and Applied Micro and starts building 64-bit ARM processors for servers, it could give AMD a low-power alternative to Intelâ€™s Xeon, says Kevin Krewell, an analyst with chip-watching firm The Linley Group. â€œThereâ€™s definitely an ongoing battle right now thatâ€™s really just staring to heat up between the ARM architecture and Intel.â€?AMD is desperate for an edge. Intel has drubbed it on servers and AMD has been badly hurt by the downturn in PC sales. Last week, as he was walking financial analysts through AMDâ€™s dreary quarterly results and plans to chop 15 percent of his companyâ€™s staff, CEO Rory Read said that the company was looking for â€œthird-party processor cores,â€? to help it build more power-efficient servers.Will those â€œthird-partyâ€? cores include ARMâ€™s? We canâ€™t say for sure, Krewell thinks that thereâ€™s a pretty good chance, especially given the fact that AMD is promising an announcement with a surprise guest the day before ARM kicks off its developer conference.â€œThe timing is interesting,â€? he says. â€œIâ€™d have to admit that Iâ€™d fall into the â€˜one plus one equals twoâ€™ camp on this one.â€?Cade Metz contributed to this story. This story has been updated to include the correct name for ARMâ€™s next-generation processor design. It is ARMv8.Bug that just keeps popping up Live authentication and won't stop.

It wasn't the password I was used to typing.The iPad has been a true tech phenomenon. Apple has sold 100 million of the tablets in just 2Â½ years, even though many people doubted they needed a $500 device that's in between a smartphone and a laptop. No competing model has gained significant traction in the market.Still, there's been a problem with the iPad. Though it's much smaller than a laptop, at just 1.44 pounds, and 0.37 inch thick, it can be too heavy to hold for long periods of time, such as when you're using it to read an e-book. It typically takes two hands to hold. Its 9.7-inch screen, while a pleasure to use, makes it too large to carry without a thought in many purses.So, on Friday, Apple is introducing a much smaller variant, the iPad Mini, which works exactly like the original and runs all the same appsâ€”the 275,000 tablet-optimized programs plus the rest of the over 700,000 apps available for the iOS operating system the iPad shares with Apple's iPhone.The iPad Mini weighs just less than 11 ounces, and is only 0.28 inch thick. That's 53% lighter and 23% thinner than the standard iPad. It's 5.3 inches wide versus 7.3 inches for its larger sibling.In shrinking the iconic iPad, Apple has pulled off an impressive feat. It has managed to create a tablet that's notably thinner and lighter than the leading small competitors with 7-inch screens, while squeezing in a significantly roomier 7.9-inch display. And it has shunned the plastic construction used in its smaller rivals to retain the iPad's sturdier aluminum and glass body.Unlike its two top small tablet competitors, the Mini has a rear camera. And unlike the Kindle Fire HD, it offers optional cellular data connectivity to supplement Wi-Fi. It has very good battery life.However, there are two downsides compared with the leading 7-inch competitors, the Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD. First, the iPad mini starts at $329, versus $199 for its two main rivals (though the Fire HD costs $214 without annoying ads). Second, it has a lower screen resolutionâ€”1024x768, versus 1280x800 for the other two.I've been testing the iPad Mini for several days and found it does exactly what it promises: It brings the iPad experience to a smaller device. Every app that ran on my larger iPad ran perfectly on the Mini. I was able to use it one-handed and hold it for long periods of time without tiring. My only complaints were that it's a tad too wide to fit in most of my pockets, and the screen resolution is a big step backwards from the Retina display on the current large iPad.But it's about 30% thinner than the leading 7-inch competitors, the Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire 7. And it's about 9% lighter than the Nexus and about 22% lighter than the Fire HD. It's very slightly narrower across than the Fire HD, but about 11% wider than the Nexus. I found it easy to hold with one hand, though the width might be a bit too much for some people with smaller hands.Even though the Mini is thinner and lighter than the leading 7-inch tablets, its larger screen provides about 35% more room for viewing content like books and Web pages. I found it easy to see and read material on the screen and to tap and swipe. My only complaint was that the keyboard, in portrait mode, felt a bit cramped, though it was fine in landscape mode. (I found that, unlike with the big iPad, it was more common for me to hold the Mini in portrait mode.)In my harsh battery test, where I play videos back to back with the screen set at 75% and the Wi-Fi on to collect email, the iPad mini exceeded Apple's battery life claim of 10 hours and lasted 10 hours and 27 minutes. That was about an hour better than the Kindle Fire HD, but about 17 minutes less than the Nexus 7.I found the cameras did a very good job. I conducted several clear video chats using the 1.2 megapixel front camera, and the 5-megapixel rear camera produced very good photos and videos. The stereo speakers sounded good to my ears.So why did Apple, whose large iPad and new Macs boast extremely high screen resolution, choose a lower resolution for the Mini? The company did so because it says there are only two resolutions that allow its tablet apps to run unmodified. One is the extremely high resolution on the current large iPad, which would have boosted the cost and lowered the battery life of the Mini. The other, the one Apple chose for the Mini, is the same resolution on iPad models consumers have snapped up: the original iPad and the iPad 2, which is still on the market at $399.This makes sense, but it means that, unlike its closest competitors, the Mini can't play video in high definition. Apple insists the device does better than standard definition, if you are obtaining the video from its iTunes service, since iTunes scales the video for the device, so it will render somewhere between standard definition and HD. It says some other services will do the same. But the lack of true HD gives the Nexus and Fire HD an advantage for video fans. In my tests, video looked just fine, but not as good as on the regular iPad.The cellular models, which will start at $459, will be available in a couple of weeks.The $329 price may well tempt some budget-conscious buyers who have lusted for an iPad. But Apple believes the lower size and weight, not the price, are the key attractions.If you love the iPad, or want one, but just found it too large or heavy, the iPad Mini is the perfect solution.Bug that just keeps popping up Live authentication and won't stop.

It wasn't the password I was used to typing.The number of apps available for Android now totals about 700,000, a Google spokesman confirmed to CNET. That's up from the 675,000the company said it had a month ago.And it equals the figure Apple most recently touted. The Cupertino, Calif., company first revealed it had about 700,000 apps available in its store last month, and Apple reiterated that amount during the iPad Mini launch last week.Hurricane Sandy did its work over the night, and Twitter has been more busy than usual, with users reporting power outages, flooding, and other weather-related damage in their area. Some of those users are actual websites and even entire website networks. Gawker, Buzzfeed, and the Huffington Post have reported outages of their respective websites due to Hurricane Sandy.The Gawker Media network consists of eight websites, such as Gizmodo, Lifehacker, and Kotaku, and all eight of them were taken down last night, and as of this writing, theyâ€™re still down. Buzzfeed also reported on Twitter last night that the website was experiencing some technical difficulties, but it seems to be back up and running as of this morning. The Huffington Post is partially back up, but the main website still seems to be down. The company has been tweeting the news, as well as posting on a temporary blog.Both New York City and New Jersey have been experiencing flooding, and approximately 6.5 million people across the northeast US are without power. There have been no reports of any major flooding, but New York City major Michael Bloomberg is urging residents to stop evacuating and stay inside until the storm passes.Appleâ€˜s 5th Avenue flagship store ended up preparing for potential flooding, and GameStop cancelled all of its midnight releases of Assassinâ€™s Creed III because of the hurricane. And while Google still announced all of their new products and features, they had to end up canceling their Android event in New York City due to the storm.Data center sites and colocation centers in and around New York City are struggling to stay online with varying degrees of success. And there are reports of intermittent issues with undersea cables crossing the Atlantic Ocean.Updated: Hurricane Sandy continued to take a toll on internet infrastructure in New York City and beyond on Tuesday.The specter of trouble with the undersea cables could be a huge deal, although experts said that there is so much redundancy that much of the risk is mitigated. Â There were some reports attributed to cable operators who said they had experienced power issues but back-up generators prevented service disruption.Update: (5:30 p.m. EDT)Â Level 3 Communications, just emailed a statement about the status of the AC-2 cable:â€œWe made extensive preparations in advance of the storm and have experienced no major service disruptions. All of our subsea cable systems are operating normally. We have experienced a minor fiber cut to one of our diversely routed, secondary backhaul lines which provides connectivity to our AC2 Cable Landing Station, and our technicians are currently working to repair it as quickly as possible. Few customers were affected because most traffic was rerouted through redundant lines. And again, the AC2 subsea cable itself is operating normally.â€?Carriers and ISPs use the cables to pump data across the Atlantic. Two of the major gateways are in Brookhaven, N.Y., (on Long Island) and in northern New Jersey, where the cables come ashore. â€œGiven the duration and strength of this storm, you have to worry about the cables getting disrupted,â€? said an executive with a data center company who did not want to be named. He said problems with the cables is â€œ the kind of thing companies will keep close to the vest. If Â either AC-1 or AC-2 were to go out there would be major, major issues.â€?As already reported, data center facilities in lower ManhattanÂ suffered a string of outagesÂ after flooding and Con Ed cut electrical power. Datagram, the web hosting company that serves the Huffington Post,Â Gawker, Gizmodo and BuzzFeed,Â went down Monday evening after floodingÂ caused those sites to go dark. DataÂ centers at Google-owned Carrier Hotel on 8th Avenue, includingÂ Equinix, XO Communications and others wereÂ also reportedly affectedÂ by power outages, though itÂ appears some are back up and running.Â And Atlantic Metro Communications alsoÂ reportedÂ disruptionsÂ due to flooding at a New York data center.Researchers with the Computer Emergency Response Team in the country of Georgia say they turned the tables on a hacker who planted advanced espionage malware on Georgian and American computers to collect sensitive security documents.Researchers had been following perpetrators behind the "Georbot Botnet" they said used advanced methods to infiltrate the computers of government ministries and parliament, banks, and non-governmental organizations. The Botnet's targets spanned Georgia, the US, Canada, Ukraine, France, and other countries. Besides exploiting unpublished software vulnerabilities to install malware, the attackers also planted malicious links on specific webpages that would interest the kinds of people being targeted.The campaign searched victim machines for documents with certain terms and also used embedded webcams and microphones to eavesdrop on targeted individuals. It began as early as March 2011 and lasted as long as 12 months. The CERT members tracking the hacking said they linked it to "Russian Security agencies."Part of their research, outlined in a 27-page report, included infecting one of the perpetrators with the same malware used in the campaign. The researchers then recorded a man as he used one of the computers the researchers had compromised.We have infected our PC from Lab, then gave Cyber Attacker Fake ZIP Archive with his own virus inside and the name "Georgian-Nato Agreement". As we had access to BOT Panel, we had maintained control over his PC. Then captured got video of him, personally. We have captured process of creating new malicious modules. We have obtained Russian Document, from e-mail, where he was giving someone instructions how to use this malicious software and how to infect targets. We have linked him with some of German and Russian hackers. Then we have obtained information about his destination city, Internet service provider, e-mail, and etc.Attributionâ€”that is, the task of determining what group or country is behind a physical or network attackâ€”has long been a complicated and imprecise undertaking. That makes it hard for disinterested third parties to state with certainty who is behind an attack and easy for the accused party or country to provide facts that seem to rebut the claims. In 2008, crippling denial-of-service attacks on Georgian banks and government websites preceded Russia's military campaign in that country. Many Georgians claim the attacks were carried out by Russians. The photographs and other data allegedly taken by the hacker's own computer may be of particular value as this latest dispute plays out.As much as Gmail shines when it's on the web, some of its most avid users stay in native apps for the multitasking; having to check a past message in the web client has usually meant putting the current draft on hold, or at least maintaining a near-photographic memory. Google wants to translate some of that desktop experience to the web through a new composition interface it's testing as of today. New messages start off in a shrinkable pop-up that lets us find old threads without having to put the new conversation on ice, even we're indecisive enough to leave multiple unfinished e-mail messages open. Other upgrades lurk in the background for the more focused among us, such as a pared-back composition interface, in-line photos and a reply box that dynamically adapts to the space it needs. Only those in the preview will see the Gmail update for now; Google is promising a wider launch in the months ahead that could save us all a few precious minutes each day.By Emma Thomasson VEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) - It looks like mission control: in a Swiss market town, an array of screens in Nestle's headquarters tracks online sentiment. Executives watch intently as California wakes up, smells the coffee - and...1 of 9.Staff of the Nestle Digital Acceleration Team (DAT) monitor social networks at the company headquarters in Vevey September 24, 2012. This is the nerve centre of the company's Digital Acceleration Team. By monitoring conversation about its products on social media - right down to ''realtime recipe tweets'' across the United States - they aim to win over a sometimes hostile world.This is the nerve centre of the company's Digital Acceleration Team.

But Nestle is also concentrating on using social media for damage limitation.Vilified for years for its sales of baby milk formula in developing countries, Nestle today is confronting its critics online as protesters find newer targets, such as the company's $7 billion a year bottled water business. The $200 billion food and beverage group set up its digital team a year ago, and says it has doubled spending on social media advertising in the last couple of years."People have been complaining about companies forever, but before they did it at the water cooler or at the bar," said Bernhard Warner, co-founder of London-based consultancy Social Media Influence. "Now they are doing it online and spreading their complaints to disparate communities."Nestle is not the only bottled water producer under fire. Others including Coca-Cola are also accused of undermining public water systems. Groups such as Boston-based Corporate Accountability International, a non-profit which originated in the protests against Nestle's infant formula, have alleged for almost a decade that bottled water makers damage the environment when they extract the water, waste resources on bottles and shipping, and take what should be a common good.The fight matters a lot to Nestle, as it's the world's largest producer of bottled water. Its brands include Poland Spring, Perrier and San Pellegrino and accounted for almost 8 percent of its sales of 83.6 billion Swiss francs ($85.31 billion) in 2011.In 2008 it ran an advertisement in Canada claiming that "bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world." Campaigners in North America have nonetheless persuaded tens of thousands of people to sign a "Think outside the bottle" pledge to drink water from the tap, and pushed some U.S. campuses and municipal buildings to ban the bottled variety.At HQ, Nestle's team of Digital Accelerators is tasked with "listening, engaging, transforming and inspiring." Each member spends eight-month stints working in the space with a mini TV studio, rather like a busy newsroom or trading floor.Pete Blackshaw, 47-year old head of digital marketing and global media, is in charge. On a recent weekday, the American and his staff of 30 to 40-year-olds were monitoring the online action on such topics as the latest cute dog photo on the Purina pet food website, or who was drinking Nescafe.Blackshaw pointed to a map of the world showing California's Twitter action. He also highlighted how the centre's screens are set up to spot trouble."If there is a negative issue emerging, it turns red," says Blackshaw, indicating a screen powered by software from Salesforce.com Inc., which is also used by such brands as Dell computers and delivery company UPS. It captures millions of posts each day on topics of interest to Nestle."When there is a high number of comments," Blackshaw adds, "it alerts you that you need to engage."That can mean a real-time online response from a team member - each has a small flag indicating their country of origin above their desk - or the team might pass an issue on.Nestle says it has strict 'do's and don'ts' for how staff should respond online, including disclosing their relationship to the company if they discuss a product. At the same time, the team is inevitably making up some rules as it goes along.The company does not pay bloggers for pro-Nestle posts and follows industry ethics codes, disclosing any "consideration" it gives, such as providing product samples to online reviewers. Common tricks used by some public figures include faking - or purchasing - social network followers: California-based web security research firm Barracuda Labs estimates the average price for 1,000 'robot' Twitter followers at $18.32 (Facebook fans are a pricier $35.59 for 1,000).When it recently thanked its "fans" for reaching 600,000 "Likes" on its main corporate Facebook page, a user identified as Andrew Wood from Britain retorted: "We are not all fans however - some have joined so that they can protest about your ethics and spread word of the long standing boycott of your products."Nestle replied on Facebook: "That's a fair point, and the terms â€˜fans' and â€˜likes' may not be the ideal descriptors for everyone. That said, we value the input and feedback from all 600,000+. Thanks for the feedback."Such responses result from a lesson learnt two years ago, when Greenpeace posted a spoof ad, watched by nearly 1.5 million people on YouTube, for Nestle's KitKat snacks.The ad showed a bored office worker take "a break" from shredding documents, to munch on a chocolate wafer finger that - unnoticed by him - had mutated into an ape-like claw. As he chewed, it spurted blood. "Give the orang-utan a break," the slogan urged. "Stop Nestle buying palm oil from companies that destroy the rainforests."Nestle initially made the problem worse, earning an entry in a book by the consultant Bernhard Warner about "the 50 greatest social media screw-ups". It tried to get the video pulled and threatened to delete hostile messages on its Facebook page.No matter what your views on palm oil, that reaction was "absolutely â€˜verboten' for digital natives," said Warner. "All corporates looked at this and thought â€˜oh my goodness, how vulnerable are we?'"Eventually, after more than 200,000 protest emails, Nestle sat its officials down with Greenpeace to plan a policy against deforestation."One of the most significant things that has happened in the corporate world in the last 10 years is this idea of being respectful of and monitoring not just what your fans have to say but also your critics," said Warner. "It has completely changed the world of crisis management and reputation management and all the training that goes into it."Nestle has climbed to 12th spot from 16th in 2011 in the Reputation Institute's index of the world's most reputable companies."They have a very strong reputation among the general public," said Nicolas Trad of the New York-based consultancy firm, which surveys 100,000 consumers for an annual reputation survey. "However, looking a little bit deeper, we find that perceptions of key opinion leaders - such as academics, regulators, nutritionists, NGOs and the like - are much weaker than those of consumers," he said. "This is risky as this group is often ahead of the curve."On the day Nestle's Digital Accelerators were monitoring online responses to cute dog photos, they were also on the lookout for word on its water business.Chairman Peter Brabeck had posted a blog in response to "Bottled Life," a documentary criticising Nestle that was released earlier this year. The documentary, shown in cinemas in Switzerland as well as at film festivals and on European TV channel Arte, alleges Nestle is "intent on amassing resource rights worldwide with the aim of dominating the water market of the future."In his blog, Nestle chairman Brabeck sought to put such criticism into the context of a broader global crisis of water scarcity. "This is the most vital issue of our time, and in this big picture, bottled water is rather irrelevant," he wrote.Among the film's targets is Pure Life, the world's top-selling bottled water brand, which is produced by Nestle and uses purified groundwater - the same water as comes out of the tap - with added minerals. Pure Life is a budget brand largely aimed at emerging markets, where demand is growing.The movie alleges a bottling plant for Pure Life in Pakistan may be contributing to a falling water table there. Nestle denies this, saying the amount used by its plant at Sheikhupura near Lahore is too small.In Pakistan, there's no conclusive evidence on either side. Data from the province of Punjab show no significant variation in the water table at testing stations in the region, but local water authorities do not maintain data on how much groundwater individual companies or industries pump.History shows the power of such objections.Around a decade ago, a California-based NGO publicised locals' worries that a Coke bottling plant in Kerala in India was damaging their water supply. The claims were rejected by Coke but eventually resulted in officials closing the plant. A government-appointed committee proposed that Coca-Cola pay damages for causing "environmental degradation by over-extraction of ground water."More than 1 million people have so far watched "Bottled Life" - not a huge audience by global standards. But social media is "the amplifier", as Blackshaw, who previously worked as a digital brand manager at Proctor & Gamble, says.Nestle's global critics have already picked up the documentary. "We are calling on Nestle to come clean about where the water is coming from and stop undermining local control of water," said Kristin Urquiza of Corporate Accountability International. "Nestle should be concerned about how this is hurting its brand image."The company has not engaged directly with the film makers: it says it responded to their questions on paper, but declined to make executives available on camera as it knew the documentary would be "polemical."In his blog, Brabeck wrote that the film "illustrated a whole spectrum of perceptions, misperceptions and allegations concerning this part of our business."A woman named Deirdre Mistarz asked on the blog about a suggestion in the film that Nestle is not willing to provide drinking water for people near the Pakistan plant: "Are the poor to be treated as lepers, to be deprived of the basic human need of clean water; are they to be extinguished because they are so poor they cannot help to fill the coffers of Nestle?"Two hours later, Brabeck responded: "This is not true. We have installed two water filtration facilities in the region which can be accessed by more than 10,000 people and we are in the process of building a third."Of course, Nestle's Digital Accelerators also use social media for traditional publicity. A French team member has developed an app that plays a cookery video when a package code is scanned. And Nestle said sales of Perrier water had a strong start to the year, helped by a video which was popular on YouTube. Its story: to save a melting world, a glamorous woman drinks Perrier.(Additional reporting by Qasim Naumann in Islamabad and Ben Beavan and Himanshu Ojha in London; Edited by Sara Ledwith, Simon Robinson and Richard Woods)It might seem that the Internet doesnâ€™t lose track of anything that has been published online. The alleged permanence of tweets, blogs, snapshots, and instant messages worries many privacy activists and policymakers such as Viviane Reding, justice commissioner of the European Union and vice president of the European Commission. She has proposed that Europe adopt a â€œright to be forgottenâ€?â€”a proposal that is now working its way through the EU legal process and could be law within two years.Redingâ€™s proposal would grant EU citizens the right to withdraw their consent from online information services after the factâ€”allowing people to redact embarrassing things from the global information commons, even after the data had been copied to other websites. Itâ€™s a controversial proposal: George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Rosen wrote in the Stanford Law Review that such a right could have deeply negative implications for both free speech and journalism and could ultimately fragment the Internet. Rosen pointed out that companies like Google would need to suppress from European search queries information that had been deemed â€œforgottenâ€? on the continent, even as such information would still be perfectly allowable in the United States.The proposal might also be unnecessary. Even without a right to be forgotten, there are still many ways that information can be removed from the Web. Such methods could be made more widespread.Somewhat surprisingly, the easiest information to remove from the Internet may be data stored in Facebook, and to a lesser extent in other social networks. Facebookâ€™s â€œStatement of Rights and Responsibilitiesâ€? says that any information a Facebook user uploads to the social network remains that userâ€™s propertyâ€”posting, liking, and otherwise interacting with Facebook merely gives the service a revocable license to the data. That license ends when the data are deleted.Wiping away those embarrassing self-portraits you took and posted when you were drunk wonâ€™t delete the copies that your friends have saved on their own hard drives. But who makes copies of photos anymore? Hereâ€™s a way that the convenience of cloud-based services works in favor of privacy controls: they give you one-stop-shopping for information oblivion, a single place to go and get something deleted.Facebook was created to make it easy for people to share their personal dataâ€”and as a result, people often share information without even realizing it. But Facebook also makes it easy to clean up after yourself. If you put your phone number in your profile, that number might get copied to your friendâ€™s cell phones through Facebookâ€™s application programming interface (API). But if you delete your phone number from your Facebook profile, that same API should go through your friendsâ€™ phones and remove your information as well. Thatâ€™s because Facebookâ€™s developer guidelines prohibit programs that access Facebook from making permanent copies of your personal information: software is only allowed to make a â€œcacheâ€? copy in order to improve performance, but that copy must be linked back so that it can be kept up to date. Such license terms, designed to keep developers dependent on Facebook, have the side effect of enforcing a privacy policy thatâ€™s surprisingly pro-consumer.Itâ€™s not necessarily difficult to have information removed from Twitter, either. Even though the companyâ€™s privacy policy warns â€œwhat you say on Twitter may be viewed all around the world instantly,â€? Twitter lets users delete their own tweets. You can delete other peopleâ€™s tweets if you are willing to swear out a complaint that the tweets violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Actâ€”thatâ€™s how big media companies get Twitter to take down links pointed at copyrighted material. (In a nod to transparency, Twitter makes those requests public on the Chilling Effects website at http://chillingeffects.org/twitter.) Most of us donâ€™t have copyright claims to make, but Twitter will also take down tweets that contain harassing or private information, including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses. Although itâ€™s possible that someone has made a copy, in many cases removing information effectively sends it down the memory hole.Yahoo and other websites have similar forms for requesting that information be taken down. They do this even though they generally are not required to by U.S. law. Advertising-funded websites make so little money off any individual piece of data that itâ€™s much easier to take information down than to spend time fighting for the rights of the person who posted the data.Back in 2005, I met a person who had been the victim of horrible harassment a few years earlier, in high school.  Even years later, this colleague of mine was still haunted by a series of harassing websites that her tormentors had put up on free Web-hosting services. My colleague was too traumatized to deal with the issue, so I sent a few e-mails to the Web-hosting companies, and within a few days the offending material had been taken down. Today a search for the personâ€™s name yields only professional results, not those teenage pranks.Unfortunately, wiping data away from every cranny of the Internet can be challenging. Consider my colleague. If you know where to look, itâ€™s still possible to find those harassing pages. They donâ€™t show up in Google or Bing, but there are copies hidden away at the Internet Archive, a website that seeks to preserve most of the Internetâ€™s content for posterity. There are procedures for removing data from the Internet Archive, but those procedures generally require the active participation of the current holder of the Web domain. Fortunately for my colleague, the Internet Archiveâ€™s pages arenâ€™t indexed by Google or Bing, so except for those people who know specifically where to look, the information is invisible.In fact, itâ€™s hard to imagine a system that could index all of the worldâ€™s information thoroughly enough to allow someone exercising the â€œright to be forgottenâ€? to track down and eradicate every regrettable message or photo. More likely, the mechanisms to find that data would cause more privacy violations than they would prevent.A better solution could be a set of standards for labeling the provenance of information on the Internet. It would be somewhat like the way Facebook requires application developers to keep checking back to see whether personal information is still acceptable to use. It would also take advantage of the privacy-protecting steps that other sites like Twitter and Yahoo sometimes are willing to take for their users.This could be done using the HTML microdata standard being developed. It is still evolving, but this standard will expand the ways that information in Web pages can be represented in their underlying HTML code. For example, the microdata could include tags designed to facilitate privacy tracking and the retraction of privacy-sensitive information. So if you persuaded a website to take down information because it violates the siteâ€™s terms of service, that website could automatically notify others that have made copies of your information, informing them that the license to use the data has been revoked.Such voluntary technical measures would go a long way toward improving the situation that policymakers hope to fix with a legal right to be forgotten.The Department of Energy has flipped the switch on what is now the world's most powerful supercomputer.The DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory facility announced on Monday that its new Titan system is now live. The supercomputer can handle 20,000 trillion calculations a second, which in computing language is referred to as 20 petaflops. ORNL says that makes Titan 10 times more powerful than the laboratory's Jaguar supercomputer, once the fastest machine in the world and now the sixth.Titan will likely unseat the DOE's Sequoia supercomputer, based on an IBM design, that is currently the world record holder.Titan gets its speed from a family of processors called graphic processing units, which were first developed for computer gaming, combined with traditional central processing units. An ORNL press release describes the computer, based on the Cray XK7 system:The supercomputer will support research in energy, climate change, efficient engines and materials science.James Hack, direction of ORNL's computational sciences center, said Titan will let scientists simulate physical systems more realistically and in greater detail.Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Machines can already drive trains, beat humans at chess and conduct countless other tasks. But what happens if technology starts getting more creative - can a machine ever win the Booker Prize for fiction? In George Orwell's fiction, by 1984 the "proles" were entertained by books produced by a machine. In real life, robots have been capable of writing a version of love letters for over 60 years. One xenia epigram - a poem originally found in Latin literature with a formal structure - has been written by poet Luke Wright for the BBC. The other is written by a computer after being given instructions about the poetic form. Can you tell which is which? To truth I offer this thanks, when needing something like realityWhen I'm writing and drawing blanks, I almost settle using actualityI am in search of more, trying to sing your praise!It's you I very much adore, lacking in so many ways. Felicity, my dear, my thanks the cheque you sent was great.Tomorrow I'll go to the bankmy rent's already late.And sorry for the shoddy rhymeI'm tired, I'm not on it,perhaps if you send more next time I'll scribble you a sonnet. But how far away are books written by robots? Well they have already happened, in their hundreds of thousands. Professor Philip Parker, of Insead business school, created software that has generated over 200,000 books, on as varied topics as the 60 milligrams of fat in fromage frais to a Romanian crossword guide. Amazon currently lists over 100,000 titles under his name. While not expecting to top the bestsellers list or win any literary awards, they take under an hour to "write" because of how they are produced and are printed when requested rather than in bulk. The books compile existing information and offer new predictions using forumulas, like estimating the future size of markets for example. But Professor Parker has experimented with a piece of software that is capable of creating automated fiction. Fiction is often criticised for being a factory process of using formula and "write by numbers" approaches. Creative writing programmes have been likened to working "from a pattern book" by Booker-nominated author Will Self. Certain pieces of writing software provide templates that will automatically create the structure of a novel and once written, can tell you how easy the novel is to read. "No novel writing package will write your book for you," says software firm NewNovelist. "They certainly can help you complete your novel and make sure it is composed correctly." I couldn't think of anything more pointless than reading a piece of fiction written by a robot But if there is a formula, can the novelist really be replaced by an algorithm? Russian Alexander Prokopovich is said to be responsible for the first successful book to be created by robots. It was published in 2008 and was written in the style of Japanese author Haruki Murakami in a variation on Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. "The program can never become an author, like Photoshop can never be Raphael," Prokopovich told the St Petersburg Times. Whether this is actually an original work of fiction is up for debate. Though this could be compared to the literary argument about whether any work of fiction is truly original. On a more simple level, the people experimenting with the technology believe that it is not as difficult to create fiction as critics believe. "Any genre of fiction that has a 'dummy's guide' to it could be created with an algorithm," says Prof Parker. "The more a genre subscribes to a formula, the more straightforward it is. "In romantic fiction, instructions for authors can be as specific as down to the page. If you feed that information into a computer, the formula is followed. Each genre has some sort of formula, just some more than others." Despite the failure of machines to deceive us into believing they are human, Turing would be excited by the remarkable progress of AI More on how Turing influenced AI Prof Parker's software, still in prototype, would allow characters to be decided, locations to be set, genre fixed and plot mechanisms chosen. It then creates anything from 3,000-word flash fiction to a 300,000-word novel. He has even done public experiments with poetry. "A computer works very well with rules and the most obvious way is poetry," he says. "We did a blind test between a Shakespearean sonnet and one that the computer had written. A majority of people surveyed preferred ours. "That's not to say it was better, Shakespeare is a genius, but it was what people preferred." With so many authors around - Mills and Boon publishes around 100 books a month - Prof Parker is keen to stress that his aim is not to produce fiction that is already created in abundance. Instead, it could be used to write in languages or on topics that are not widely covered. But computers are not just seen as a threat to creative work but to other writing as well. Startup company Narrative Science has started creating articles, without a human doing the writing. With 30 clients for its articles already, written automatically by a machine collating data and writing "rich narrative content" from it, the death of the journalist has been mentioned in more than one speculative column. Business news site Forbes is using the service for a number of pieces each weekday. But if neither Beryl Bainbridge nor Martin Amis can win the Booker Prize, what chance does a machine really have? And if creative writing really is creative, what new ideas could a computer offer? "I couldn't think of anything more pointless than reading a piece of fiction written by a robot," says science fiction author Alastair Reynolds. Computers are already useful in developing new mathematical theories "Even if it was indistinguishable from your average Booker Prize winning novel. "You might find a lot of regurgitated platitudes but I can't imagine a piece of software being capable of producing something that would stop you in your tracks. Not until we get truly intelligent computers." The Loebner Prize of $100,000 was set up as an offer to the first computer program to convince testers that it was human through two-way communication. No-one has won that prize yet but it could be that the written word, without interaction, could provide a more immediate way to confuse the reader as to who or what is writing. And then a different sort of prize could only be a step away. "I don't think the computer will win the Booker but no-one ever expected a computer to beat a chess grandmaster," says Reynolds. "A normal tool in a mathematician's tool kit is the computer. 100 years ago, it would be considered heresy. "The idea of a computer winning the Nobel Prize for physics is not too unlikely, citing a computer as joint recipient. It's obviously not a huge leap to think of something similar happening in fiction." Note: To Felicity is written by the poet Luke Wright. To Truth is written by computer softwareThe company's Maps application was powered by Google until iOS 6, when Apple took matters into its own hands.Apple has won a patent for built-in mapping applications running on its mobile operating system.Referred to as "Touch screen device, method, and graphical user interface for providing maps, directions, and location-based information," the patent, which was awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, describes -- as one might expect from the title -- the way in which maps, directions, and location-based information are displayed on a touch-screen-equipped device.AppleInsider was first to discover the patent.The focus of Apple's patent appears to be improving the experience of actually using a mapping application. Apple's patent describes issues with user interfaces employed by GPS devices, saying that they "include physical push buttons [that] are also inflexible.""Mapping applications are available for mobile phones (e.g., Google maps for mobile, available at www.google.com/gmm). But navigating in such applications using physical push buttons (e.g., the number keys on a hard keyboard) or touch screens in existing mobile phones is cumbersome for most users," Apple wrote in its patent. "Thus, at present, relatively few people use mapping applications in mobile phones and other portable devices."Apple filed its patent in 2008 when companies like Garmin and TomTom were still selling boatloads of portable GPS devices that largely required physical buttons to work.As Apple continues to describe its patent, the company discusses how its interface design, relying mainly on touch screens and a user's fingers, makes navigation more intuitive.What's perhaps most interesting, though, is that Apple won the patent despite using Google's mapping services in its built-in application for the last several years. Only this year did Apple switch to its own built-in mapping offering, called Maps.That changeover has caught the ire of many users who have witnessed Maps' many errors and omissions. Apple has promised improvements, but so far, the application, by most accounts, pales in comparison to Google Maps.Apple's Maps patent is the latest in a string of intellectual property the company has scored in the last several weeks. Just last week, in fact, Apple won 34 patents.Just a reminder: when you think you get past an attempt by certain legacy industries to shove through bad laws with questionable international trade agreements, there's always at least one (and probably more) such agreements lurking. So, from ACTA we went straight into TPP... and following TPP, it looks like the US and the EU are already discussing a new US-EU Free Trade Agreement to be worked out soon. A "working group" to get the process started put out a report about what the agreement would include... and, of course, there will be a section on "intellectual property." The USTR has made it clear over the past few years that it thinks free trade agreements are the perfect vehicle for intellectual property maximalism. This makes little sense, since intellectual property is the exact opposite of "free trade." It's whole purpose is to be a trade barrier and a monopoly. But...So, at the very least, there would be some limits on what such an agreement would get into, given existing "differences," but they still seem to want to include something about "dealing with IPR matters," which can only mean ratcheting things up. It's still early, but you can bet that the legacy industry lobbyists are already well aware of this and involved in the process -- so it needs to be on everyone else's radar as well. Oh, and both Obama and Romney have indicated they support such an agreement, so it's not like either one is better than the other going into next year.MacRumors attracts a broad audience of both consumers and professionals interested in the latest technologies and products. We also boast an active community focused on purchasing decisions and technical aspects of the iPhone, iPod, iPad, and Mac platforms.Looking for a job? We are hiring.China is growing in importance in the tech industry. The Chinese have been dominant for years in regard to manufacturing, and weâ€™ve discussed their monopoly on certain vital elements for electronics production before. Now, they are becoming increasingly more dominant as a purchasing power of technology.Itâ€™s recently come to light that China is now accounting for 15% of Appleâ€™s revenue. That is an increase of 3% in the last fiscal year. More impressively, itâ€™s an increase of 13% since 2009. In this past quarter, China brought in $5.7 billion for Apple. If this trend continues, it wonâ€™t be long at all until China is on par with the US in terms of revenue generated for Apple.In the English-speaking Western world, it is all too easy to think almost exclusively about sales and market share in Europe and North America. Clearly, the Chinese cannot be ignored anymore. They arenâ€™t just some country of little consequence where our computers and phones are made. They are becoming a financial force to be reckoned with, and the Apples and Samsungs of the world arenâ€™t stupid. China is looking more and more dominant by the day.As phone and computer saturation reaches its pinnacle in North America and Europe, those markets just arenâ€™t as interesting to an industry addicted to ever-increasing growth. Countries like China, India, and Brazil are going to be the new golden children of the tech world. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before this becomes the driving force of the majority of tech companies.What does this mean for the industry? Besides the ego-blow to the long-dominant Western countries, it also means that tech companies are going to start prioritizing the needs and desires of the Chinese people. Design, engineering, and business could all be drastically shifted with developing and recently-developed countries in mind. When products are being developed, it would be very short-sighted for companies not to consider heavily how well they will play to Chinese consumers.Most importantly, we need to keep in mind that the current way of doing business just might not scale. If demand grows in size three or four times in a relatively short period of time, supply constraints will become a real issue. The pre-order allotment of iPad Minis sold out in the first twenty-or-so minutes. Think about a world where we have two-to-three billion more consumers of iPads, laptops, and phones. It might be months before everyone who wants a new product can purchase it. Itâ€™s a real problem, and we canâ€™t ignore it any longer.Now read: Rare earth crisis: Innovate, or be crushed by China[Image credit: chinnian]NEW YORK (AP) -- PayPal is cutting 325 full-time jobs to streamline its business and speed up product development amid intense competition from plucky startups and established companies such as Google.The company also is ending jobs with about 120 independent contractors worldwide.The job cuts have been expected and were reported by The Associated Press earlier this month. Its parent company, San Jose, Calif.-based eBay Inc., said it expects to book a restructuring charge of about $15 million in the current quarter, related to the job cuts.Monday's cuts represent about 2.5 percent of PayPal's work force of 13,000. The company said the cuts are primarily in PayPal's product and technology organizations. PayPal said it wants to simplify and speed up how products are developed. The moves come as PayPal faces increasing competition in the world of online and offline payments services such as Square Inc. and Google Inc."If we don't change, we simply won't be able to sustain PayPal's global leadership position over time. And we will not let that happen," PayPal's president, David Marcus, wrote in a memo sent out to employees and obtained by the AP. "To do this we need a simpler, streamlined place to work."The Supreme Court today heard oral arguments in Kirtsaeng v. Wiley & Sons Company, a case that could further undermine the "first sale doctrine." First sale, described in section 109 of the US Copyright Act, gives people the right to resell, lend, or give away the works that theyâ€™ve bought, even if those works contain copyrighted elements.Textbook publisher Wiley claims that this doctrine only applies to goods that are manufactured in the U.S., and that the defendant, Supap Kirtsaeng, was infringing its copyright by purchasing books at a reduced rate in his native Thailand and selling them below list price in the States.The effects of such a dubious interpretation could be far-reaching for American consumers, and it appears several Supreme Court Justices were appropriately concerned about the implications of Wileyâ€™s proposed geographic limit on first sale. Of course, itâ€™s unwise to predict how the Court will decide a case based solely on comments during the oral arguments, but they can provide insight into what factors the Justices are considering. Today the Court mirrored our concerns about the right of Americans to resell the goods that theyâ€™ve legally acquired â€” from books to smartphones to cars â€” just because those goods happen to contain copyrighted materials and were manufactured overseas.Defenders of Wileyâ€™s position are quick to denounce those concerns as overblown. It's curious, then, that Wileyâ€™s own lawyer, former Solicitor General Ted Olson, was hard-pressed to explain why. Justice Breyer asked about specific examples â€” buying a book overseas to give to your wife in the U.S., or reselling a Toyota manufactured in Japan with numerous individually copyrighted components â€” andÂ  did not seem impressed with the answers he got. And when Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Roberts questioned Olson about the "parade of horribles," raised by Kirtsaeng and supporting amici (including EFF), he asserted that, yes, indeed, sales of foreign made goods might require approval from the copyright holder, whether the seller is a Toyota distributor or a university library:It goes without saying that a secondary market that exists only with the permission of innumerable copyright holders is a poor substitute for the genuine article. Consumers would be worse off for it, and itâ€™s not what Congress intended.Later, in questioning the Deputy Solicitor General arguing on behalf of the government, Justice Alito was even more explicit about the choice facing the Court:Pressed in this manner, the government conceded:The Court also appropriately persisted in asking questions about the perverse incentive that Wileyâ€™s interpretation would provide to manufacturers in moving their production overseas.Critics of the Second Circuitâ€™s decision in Kirtsaeng have been accused of exaggeration. Perhaps Justice Breyer put it best today:Itâ€™s gratifying that the Court seems to appreciate the ramifications of this case, even if Wileyâ€™s attorneys do not. Weâ€™ll be watching closely as the Court releases an opinion.But thatâ€™s not end of the story. Regardless of the Courtâ€™s decision, we need to be prepared to tell elected lawmakers that we stand up for first sale, whether the threat is through arcane import regulations or onerous EULAs.

However, it would be a mistake to think that the user interface is the only thing that's new in Windows 8: there's a lot that's changed behind the scenes, too.Just as is the case with the user interface, many of the improvements made to the Windows 8 core are motivated by Microsoft's desire to transform Windows into an effective tablet operating system. Even those of us with no interest at all in tablets can stand to take advantage of these changes, however. For example, Windows 8 is more power efficient and uses less memory than Windows 7; while such work is critical to getting the software to run well on low-memory tablets with all-day battery life, it's equally advantageous for laptop users.The biggest single piece of technology that is new to Windows 8 is, however, squarely Metro focused: it's a large set of libraries and components called WinRT. I've already written extensively about what WinRT is, so I won't be getting into that here, but there are system capabilities that WinRT apps can use (or are forced to use) that are interesting in their own right.First up is sandboxing. Metro-style apps are all sandboxed: by default, each app can only read from and write to its own private storage area. If the app needs to do anything more than thisâ€”access the Pictures library, say, or connect to the network as either a client or a serverâ€”it must explicitly indicate that it needs these extra capabilities in something called a manifest. This prevents apps from being able to read each other's files, documents that you haven't explicitly granted them permission to read, and so on. This serves two purposes; it helps safeguard user privacy, instilling greater confidence in apps downloaded from the store, and it also reduces the impact of security flaws in those apps.These sandboxes are enforced by a new Windows 8 feature called AppContainers, which in turn builds on a feature introduced in Windows Vista, called integrity levels. Before integrity levels, access to files and registry keys on Windows was governed solely by the user identity. Every file and registry key has an access control list (ACL) which describes which users and groups can perform what operations to those files and registry keys. For example, an ACL on a file might say that User A can read the file, User B can read and write the file, and Group C can read, write, and delete the file. Every process running with User B's identity would have the same access to that file: read and write.Integrity levels created a system to give processes all running with the same user identity different levels of access to the system. Each process has not just the user identity, but also an integrity level, denoting the trust given to the process. Web browsers, for example, would be given low integrity, because they're not especially trusted (because they are so often attacked and exploited by malicious Web pages). A normal process such as Notepad might be given medium integrity, because it's relatively unlikely to be attacked. An installer or setup program might be given high integrity, because it's trusted to update pieces of system configuration. There is also an untrusted integrity, that's even lower than low, and a system integrity, that's even higher than high.Every file and registry key on the system is tagged with an integrity level, which specifies the minimum level required to write the file. Reads are (almost) always allowed. Temporary directories, for example, might be tagged with low integrity, allowing even Web browsers to use them. System directories will be tagged with high integrity, preventing modification by low and medium integrity processes.This integrity level system was instrumental in User Account Control (UAC), the confirmation prompts also introduced with Windows Vista. With UAC enabled, even an Administrator account normally runs processes with only medium integrity, and hence preventing modification of system files. Clicking on a UAC prompt creates a process with high integrity. This is why you need to perform UAC elevation before you can modify system files.AppContainers introduce an additional integrity level, called simply AppContainer. AppContainer is even more restricted than low integrity. AppContainer blocks both reads as well as writes. Unlike low integrity, it isn't a simple tag. When each Metro app is installed, the system examines the capabilities that the app says it needs in its manifestâ€”network access, library access, and so onâ€”and constructs a unique AppContainer security identifier based on those capabilities. When the app is run, it not only has the AppContainer integrity level applied; it also has this security identifier applied.Windows then uses this information to perform extra validation whenever the process tries to perform a restricted operation, such as opening a file or making a network connection. It uses the information in the security identifier to determine whether to allow the operation. For example, only if the security identifier indicates that the process has "access the Photos library" capability will the system allow the app to open files from the Photos library.This system allows Windows to exercise tight control over Metro applications. It removes access to almost the entire system, letting them see only a tiny selection of files.Although the sandboxing AppContainer mechanism is primarily used by Metro apps, it's not actually restricted to them. There's an API and documentation for it, and regular applications, even on the desktop, can use it. The first application to actually do so is Internet Explorer 10. Internet Explorer has two guises in Windows 8; a desktop guise, and a Metro guise. The Metro guise puts all of its tabs in AppContainers, so if a malicious attack is made, it will be quite a bit harder for the attacker to break out and damage the system.Desktop Internet Explorer doesn't put its tabs in AppContainers by default, because most plugins and extensions can't cope with such a limited environmentâ€”they need to at least be able to read the hard disk, so need at least low integrity. However, you can opt in to a new mode called Enhanced Protected Mode that will put each tab of the desktop browser into a sandbox. If you come across a page that needs an extension, Internet Explorer will offer to reload the page without the sandbox.Mozilla has investigated the AppContainer mechanism for its own Metro browser so Internet Explorer is unlikely to be the sole browser to offer this security. Other software such as Adobe Reader also uses sandboxing, and over time could take advantage of this Windows 8 feature.Preserving battery life is one of the key goals for Metro applications. Unlike desktop applications, Metro applications aren't in general allowed to run in the background; unless you're actively looking at a Metro application, Windows suspends it after a few seconds. If memory becomes low, Windows will quietly terminate the app. Switching back to the app, whether it was suspended or terminated, resumes it.To ensure that apps don't lose their state when terminated, they're given an opportunity to save any necessarily information just before they get suspended. They can then reload this information when resumed, allowing the user to continue using the app without any interruption.Apps that need to do work in the background without that work being interrupted by suspension and resumption can register background tasks. These background tasks are subject to tight CPU and network usage constraints to ensure they don't interfere with the machine's performance.In and of itself, that's not too special. It's just suspending and resuming some processes. However, Windows 8 takes this to another level with a feature called Connected Standby.Connected Standby allows Windows to take process suspension to the next level, pausing not just apps but the entire machine, while still allowing these background tasks to run.With Connected Standby, the operating system can put itself in an extremely low-power suspended state, but without losing network connectivity. Whenever some network activity occurs, it will wake up just enough to handle that activity, before going back to sleep. With Connected Standby, a system can receive all the power savings and long lifetime of standby mode, but still fetch new e-mail as it arrives, respond to VoIP calls, or whatever else it might take to keep up-to-date.Connected Standby isn't a pure software feature. It requires network adaptors to support a special suspend mode, whereby they remain connected to the network, but do not need the CPU to poll them periodically (this is particularly an issue for USB network adaptors). It also requires a processor that can operate without a fan, a solid state disk, and the system firmware to advertise support of a very-low-power idle mode.These capabilities, especially the ability to operate without a fan, are rare, and presently restricted to certain system-on-chip (SoC) machines, such as Microsoft's Surface. The passive cooling requirement makes it unlikely that we'd ever see, for example, Connected Standby support on an Ivy Bridge machine, but none of the requirements actually require the use of SoCs.When a system supports Connected Standby, those Metro background tasks can fire up if necessary even when the system is suspended. Programs such as Skype listen out for network activity in a background task. The system goes to sleep, but if the Skype connection should start receiving data due to an incoming call or instant message, the network adaptor wakes the CPU and lets the Skype task start handling the data. Skype might then update its indicator on the lock screen to show that you've got a new IM or missed a call, or it could sound the speaker to alert you to the call.Connected Standby allows machines to sleep for days at a time while still remaining up-to-date. The only wrinkle is that at the moment, only Metro apps can register background tasks to run during Connected Standby. Desktop applications get completely su
