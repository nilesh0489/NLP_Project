Appearing on Monday night’s episode of “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore begged Democrats to go vote, saying: “Don’t trust that this is in the bag.”

Even though President Barack Obama is widely projected to win, Moore insisted that more than 90 million people still likely won’t vote, meaning there’s no way to say who’s really going to be the next president.

“So many people fought for this right, it was so hard because we have fought voter suppression for 200-plus years of this country,” he said. “Exercise that right. Go to the polls. Don’t stay home. It’s only 20 minutes, and it’s free. It’s your country.”

He added that there’s a “goldmine” of potential Obama voters among those who normally don’t cast ballots, many more of whom polls show would vote for Obama than Romney. “We all know somebody,” Moore said. “Make it your mission [Tuesday] to get that person out to vote. Take them to lunch, take them to the bar afterwards, do whatever you have to do that’s legal to get them to the polls. And they’ll feel good that they did this, and they’ll maybe vote again next time.”

Most important of all, he stressed, is that Democrats don’t become too presumptuous as the night rolls on. “Don’t trust that this is in the bag,” he concluded. “Don’t do the end zone dance tonight. Everybody, up in the morning. Get out and vote and get out there and get people to vote, because that other side, believe me, they’re going to be out there.”
