NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) ? A Clarksville mother accused of berating Transportation Security Administration officers trying to pat down her teenage daughter has been found guilty of disorderly conduct.

Jurors began deliberating around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday and reached their verdict about four hours later. Abbott faces up to 30 days in jail and a $50 fine.

Transportation Security Officer Karen King testified that before the pat-down, Abbott yelled in her face that she didn?t want anyone ?touching her daughter?s crotch.?

Abbott eventually allowed her then-14-year-old daughter to undergo the pat-down, but then she refused a pat-down for herself and was arrested.

Abbott took the stand during the trial and acknowledged that she did say a few curse words but said she wasn?t in anyone?s face and had a ?normal conversation? about why she believed the pat-down to be inappropriate.
