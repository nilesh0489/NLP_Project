A month ago, we reported that Massachusetts Republican Senator Scott Brown has held over thirty Washington, D.C. fundraisers with lobbyists and other elite donors but hasn’t held a single open town hall for all of his constituents to come to.

Since then, Brown has yet to hold any town hall events, even as he’s campaigning against bold progressive Elizabeth Warren, who has steadily overtaken him in the polls. That means Brown has been in office a whopping 1,000 days and he hasn’t held any open town hall events for his constituents.

In his last campaign for office, Brown said that he was running for “the people’s seat.” But he consistently refuses to meet with the people.

Take action. Sign up to make calls for his bold progressive opponent Elizabeth Warren.
