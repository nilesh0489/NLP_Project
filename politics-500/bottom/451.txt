Incredibly, Republican candidate John Raese, in his race against anti-abortion Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, uses the fact that he has two daughters to justify his opposition to allowing abortions for girls and women who are impregnated through either rape or incest. From  On the Issues:

I am pro-life. I believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death. I have two daughters, and every parent and grandparent who has seen an ultrasound or a sonogram of their child or grandchild already has an inherent problem with abortion. In the womb is where human life is at its most innocent and vulnerable stage, and I will proudly stand against the destruction of innocent human life unless the life of the mother is in jeopardy.

Raese has enjoyed the support of Romney endorser Ted Nugent, who infamously threatened violence against Obama -- remarks that Raese defended. Romney never disavowed the Nugent endorsement, which his campaign actively sought.
