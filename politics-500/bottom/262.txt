A last-minute order by Ohio Secretary of State John Husted concerning provisional ballots is being criticized by voter advocates, who filed a federal court motion late Friday asking a judge to clarify the issue.

According to the Associated Press, union lawyers said the order, which was issued earlier Friday, "wrongly puts the burden of recording the form of ID used on a provisional ballot on voters, not poll workers," and increases the changes that votes would be rejected for inaccuracy on the form.

Judge Algenon Marbley gave Husted until Monday to respond, and the matter is not expected to be resolved before the election day. But Marbley hinted that he would rule before Nov. 17, when provisional ballots would begin to be counted in Ohio.
