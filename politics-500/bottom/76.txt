Alan Grayson, the liberal provocateur from Orlando who was defeated in the 2010 midterms, has won a return trip to Washington.

Grayson defeated Republican Todd Long in a newly drawn district. “The ‘Congressman with Guts’ is back where he belongs," Florida Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith said.

Meantime, Republican Rep. Allen West, the Grayson of the right, lost a narrow re-election bid to Patrick Murphy.

In Miami, embattled Rep. David Rivera appears on the verge of defeat.
