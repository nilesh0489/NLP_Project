So at this point, Romney is telling everybody that he will be a leader for 'one nation' and he cares about '100% of Americans.' Of course, that narrative didn't begin to be woven until after he was busted on the video of addressing a bunch of rich folks. That wasn't 'gotcha journalism' that was someone being very genuine while speaking and then having regret that the video surfaced. We know that.

So don't you ever wonder what kinds of things he's told other very wealthy people while addressing them privately in or one of the many other speeches where the press wasn't allowed?

Because I'm trying to sort out this idea of the middle class supporting a man who is 100% a very wealthy man himself who is going to watch out for other very wealthy people and corporations. And to be 100% honest, we don't know what kind of programs he's intending on slashing in an effort to balance the budget but we know they're going to affect the middle class in a tragic way at a time whenever we're so close to moving forward with economic recovery.

Do you folks not care that the middle class will take the brunt of this man's policies, where his heart genuinely lies and how it will affect the poor and the middle class? I am genuinely interested.
