It will have zero effect on a certain Romney landslide in Utah, but the particular wording and reasoning of the Salt Lake Tribune’s editorial endorsing Barack Obama will resonate far and wide. The “Trib” chose to write its repudiation of semi-favorite-son Mitt with the tone of someone familiar with a pol who’s sold his birthright for a mess of pottage:

Sounds like the buildup to an endorsement, eh? Not hardly.

The editorial eventually gets around to some measured positive comments about Barack Obama, but it’s clear from the headline—“Too Many Mitts”—that its main thrust is aimed at showing not everybody in Utah is buying this particular snowstorm.

The president is entertaining audiences today by referring to his opponent with his vast number of serpentine manuevers as someone suffering from “Romnesia.” The Salt Lake Tribune begs to differ: Mitt hasn’t forgotten a thing; he’s just doing whatever the political markets call for, and hoping voters suffer from Romnesia.
