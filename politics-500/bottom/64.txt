OUTSIDE BOSTON -- Mark Schultz was "a little dumbstruck," but not surprised when he received a robo-call at his house Saturday around noon.

The call said "Hi, I'm one of your neighbors in Holliston and ... I want to urge you to vote for Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama on Wednesday, November 7." The date, said the call, had been changed because of Hurricane Sandy.

Thankfully the Democratic Town Committee member and former FinCom member knew this information was incorrect, but he posted to Facebook to make sure others knew the same. The caller ID listed it as Massachusetts 000-0000. 

The registered Democrat said he has heard of this happening around the country, but not in this area.

"It's a new low in campaigning," he said, adding, "I don't know who it was, but it was clearly a robo-call because I couldn't talk to a person. I'm guessing they did target me because I'm a registered Democrat."

Schultz said other campaigns have been trying "virtually anything to win."

"The trickery ... downright deception on a national level" is unbelievable.
