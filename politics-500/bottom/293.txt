GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP) - Organizers of an investment conference in the Cayman Islands say they have been forbidden from disclosing any details about a speech by former President George W. Bush in the offshore financial haven.

A spokesman for the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit says the speech is totally closed to all journalists. Spokesman Dan Kneipp says he is not even permitted to discuss the subject of Bush's speech scheduled for Thursday evening at the Ritz-Carlton on Grand Cayman island.

He says the restrictions were imposed by the former president's staff.

Sponsors of the two-day summit include KPMG, a company that provides tax advisory services, and Deutsche Bank. It costs $4,000 to attend and other speakers include billionaire Richard Branson.
