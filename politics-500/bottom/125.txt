Thank you for visiting Vallejo Times Herald. We are sorry the article that you requested is no longer available. Please search for this article in our archive search. The Times-Herald permits postings on its website so visitors may comment on topics or engage in on-line discussions. Most visitors have abided by simple terms of compliance that make these threads interesting, provocative and enlightening. However, when visitors resort to hateful, vulgar or personal attacks or statements, the experience not only is lessened for others, it often drives from the site many people who might have something beneficial to say. This includes children. We strongly urge that visitors abide by simple rules of decorum, including avoiding profanity and hate messages. We continue to reserve the right to remove any postings, and subject the poster to removal from future postings. Thank you for your cooperation. • Readers: Frequently Asked Questions about our new commenting system. Please let us know what you think.
