Every so often, the world of cable news delivers Jon Stewart such succulent material, the Daily Show host can hardly contain his elation. Fox News on election night delivered the goods.

After Fox called Ohio for President Obama, Republican strategist Karl Rove nearly had a meltdown, criticizing the network for what he called a premature projection. Host Megyn Kelly asked Rove if he wasn’t just using math, as a Republican, to “make himself feel better.”

“By the way, ‘Math You Do As A Republican To Make Yourself Feel Better’ is a much better slogan for Fox than the one they have now,” Stewart said Wednesday. Kelly then left the studio to wander the halls to the network’s decision desk to get to the bottom of the story. “Yes, last night, tragically, there was an avalanche on Bullshit Mountain, ladies and gentlemen,” Stewart said.

But, alas, Ohio — and the election — was called, and President Obama won another term. According to Bill O’Reilly and Sarah Palin, Americans who feel they are entitled to “things” cast their vote for the president who give them handouts.

“What an incredible story to tell yourselves,” Stewart said. “We would’ve won if it weren’t for the moral failings of the non-real America. Fox lost because last night, minorities, who feel entitled to things, came and took the country away form the self-sufficient, white, Medicare retirees and upper class tax avoidance experts — or, as they’re also known, your audience.”
