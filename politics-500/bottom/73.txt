Steve Schmidt, republican strategist for John McCain admitted this morning on MSNBC that Voter fraud doesn’t really exist. Said he, who connived for McCain/Palin… “ I think that all of this stuff that has transpired over the last two years is in search of a solution to a problem, voting fraud, that doesn’t really exist when you look deeply at the question. It’s part of the mythology now in the Republican Party that there’s widespread voter fraud across the country. “

Thinkprogress writes… “Since 2000, there has been about one case of voter impersonation per every 15 million votes cast, according to a report from ProPublica, and even proponents of voter ID have struggled to identify cases of fraud.”

Mr Schmidt was on the MSNBC program ‘The Daily Rundown’ with a panel of fellow journalists/commenters. It has long been said that the Republicans had made up the lies about voter fraud just to disenfranchise Democratic voters… without considering that fellow Americans fought and died so that we all can have the right to vote. 

The Republicans’ have me fuming to the point that I will charge that they are evil to disregard the lives that were lost fighting in one way or another, to give us the right to vote. I also am willing to say that those who support Republicans while they disenfranchise American voters are also evil for demeaning those who lost their lives. 

This is not an issues matter, this is an American matter, a patriotic matter…nay a matter of Treason against the American people and those who gave up their lives for us to vote! They disgust me!
