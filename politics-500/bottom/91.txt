Biden spoke to about 1,000 people at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh on Friday. Later in the day, he drew about 1,500 people at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha.

Biden criticized Republican Mitt Romney for not condemning the remarks about rape and pregnancy made by Indiana's Republican Senate candidate, Richard Mourdock, and Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's remarks about "legitimate rape."

"It's not enough to tell me you don't agree," Biden said. "It's having the moral courage to stand up and say what they said is wrong."

The vice president peppered his speeches with familiar criticisms of Romney and running mate Paul Ryan. He said Romney "meant what he said" when he contended that 47 percent of Americans see themselves as victims entitled to government assistance.

"I don't recognize the country he's talking about," Biden said.
