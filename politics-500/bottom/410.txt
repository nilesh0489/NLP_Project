On The Daily Show last night, Jon Stewart went on a riff about what he dubbed "Swing State Hell" — a look into the barrage of political advertising in Ohio. 

During the segment, Stewart highlighted Republican nominee Mitt Romney's brutal flubs this week on General Motors and Chrysler, pointing to the widely debunked ad that suggested Chrysler are moving U.S. jobs overseas. The ad said that Chrysler was now in the hands of Italians “who are going to build Jeeps in China.”

“What? Sold Chrysler to Italians? We’re afraid of Italians now? If Obama wins, it’ll be the Pope deciding what you drive,” Stewart said. “One day they’re ruining our car companies, the next day they’ll be kissing our daughters with their garlicky lips.”

Stewart joked about how even car salespeople were coming after Romney.

“How out there is Mitt Romney? A car company — the people who convince you you need the undercoating — are coming after him for his dishonesty,” he quipped.
