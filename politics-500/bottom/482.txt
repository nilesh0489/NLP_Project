I think 9/11 first responders deserve health benefits after getting cancer and other ailments due to their heroic efforts. Many of our elected officials disagreed. This being election season, I decided to put together the infographic below listing all of the politicians running for office this November that voted against the James L. Zadroga Health and Compensation Act.

Why would they vote against it you ask? Because they refused to pass anything until the Bush tax cuts were extended. Tax cuts > healthcare for heroes.
