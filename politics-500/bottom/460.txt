While it appears polling locations are busy, things are for the most part running smoothly as voters head to the polls in Tri-State. But some voters have reported problems when they tried to vote. Local 12 News Reporter Tiffany Wilson spoke to election officials about the problem. We learned of it from a couple who lives in Forest Park and who vote at Word of Deliverance Church.  When Acquanitia and Thomas Moxley showed up this morning, a poll worker said that they already voted absentee. The Moxley's contend they never requested an absentee ballot-nor did they fill one out. They say they've voted at the polls every year since they turned 18 years old.Precinct officials told them to cast a provisional ballot.  Wilson went down to the Board of Elections, where the deputy director checked the official list and confirmed the Moxley's story. Meanwhile, other voters began reporting similar problems.  Officials finally figured out that human error is to blame and affects the voters at only that Forest Park polling. Those voters will be asked to cast a provisional ballot.  Officials will wait ten days to count the votes-but they will be counted.Polling places all over the Tri-State are seeing a lot of voters. Voters waited in line for the polls to open at Saint William Church in West Price Hill at 6:30 this morning. The place remained busy during the morning rush of voters. Some people say they waited up to 45 minutes to vote. However, poll workers indicate everything is running smoothly.
