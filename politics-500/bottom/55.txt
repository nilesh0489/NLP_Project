FINAL POLL: Maine Marriage Equality Set To Pass| Public Policy Polling has released its final poll for Maine, and marriage equality has the support of 52 percent of voters, with 45 percent planning to vote no on Question 1 and 3 percent undecided. Interestingly, 53 percent say they believe same-sex marriage should be legal. Maine’s is the first and so-far only ballot initiative brought by petition to approve the freedom to marry and would be an historic victory for civil rights if it passes.
