On election night Karl Rove was stunned when the state of Ohio was called for Barack Obama. He had been overly confident all night that Ohio would go to Mitt Romney. Now we may know why he was so stunned. The hacktivist group Anonymous has suggested that they found out about a Karl Rove planned scheme, much like what was suggested to have happened in 2004 and possibly 2000, where a Rove sponsored group planned to intercept vote totals on their way to the Sec. of State vote tabulators and change the vote totals giving the win to Mitt Romney. If what Anonymous is suggesting is true, Anonymous blocked access to this pre-planned backdoor hack into the vote totals and stopped Karl's minions on election night from stealing the election.
