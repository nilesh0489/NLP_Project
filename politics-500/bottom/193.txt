Some apologies are in order. The Idiot's Guide to Foreign Policy was supposed to prepare debate viewers for all the geopolitical minutia they wouldn't typically encounter in an atlas or a history book, but did not prepare readers for this statement from Mitt Romney…

Problem: Iran has access to the sea through the Persian Gulf and Syria and Iran don't share a border. Romney advisers explained the comment to the Washington Post by noting that "Syria offers Iran strategic basing/staging access to the Mediterranean as well as to terrorist proxies in the Levant." But I prefer to believe that mainstream cartography has a well-known liberal bias, which can only be resolved by adopting Romneygraphic map seen above.
