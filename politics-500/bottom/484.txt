Every time I think about the election I just get feelings of dread about voter suppression. Already we are seeing long lines because of Republicans clamping down on early voting. And potential horror stories of votes being lost or destroyed are already surfacing.

I am terrified. Not that the majority of the country doesn't want Obama, but that they do and the GOP steals the election.
