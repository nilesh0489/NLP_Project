Last night during the presidential debate President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney got into a bit of a verbal scuffle over Mitt Romney’s false claim that he did not say the auto industry should go bankrupt.

PRESIDENT OBAMA: You’ve held the floor for a while. The — look, I think anybody out there can check the record. Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know, airbrush history here. You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace. That wasn’t true. They would have gone through a — PRESIDENT OBAMA: I — no, I am not wrong. PRESIDENT OBAMA: I am not wrong. And — MR. ROMNEY: People can look it up. You’re right. PRESIDENT OBAMA: People will look it up.

The fact is that Mitt Romney did say the auto industry should go bankrupt, in a New York Times op-ed, “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.”

Bottom line of the op-ed is Romney’s position was to let auto companies go bankrupt, and the federal government might step in only to guarantee private loans that the auto companies would get.

It was impossible for the auto companies to get credit — that’s a fact.

And people did look it up — during the debate, as Google notes in the image, above.
