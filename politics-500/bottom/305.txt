John Catsimatidis, a billionaire supermarket magnate who raised money this year for Mitt Romney, has some advice for his Republican Party.

"Republicans nationally should drop this abortion issue," he told me in an interview this morning. "This is ridiculous. Women should be able to do anything they want with consulting their own doctors. And this abortion issue, that somebody should decide what a woman should do, is wrong."

As a Romney supporter, Catsimatidis said, he thought voters would look favorably on Romney's private-sector experience. But he thinks the election result demonstrates a more pressing problem for the G.O.P.: its narrow base.

"Romney was wrong on immigration," Catsimatidis said. "Romney was wrong on women's policies."

History-making candidacies are hard to compete against, he said.

"I think Republicans have to expand their base," he told me. "Bring in Asians, bring in Hispanics."

Then he said, Obama got "93 percent of the black vote," he continued. "I believe that's reverse racism."

He said it was normal for a candidate to draw heavy support from his or her own demographic block, but he took issue with the margin Obama achieved among African-American voters.

"If a Jewish candidate runs, he'll probably get 70 percent of the Jewish vote," Catsimatidis said. "I think 93 percent shows a little bit of racism. It should have been closer to 70 percent."

"I have a lot of African-American friends," said Catsimatidis, describing them as "common sense, pro-business, pro-people" voters, which is how he regularly describes himself.

"Maybe it was ethnic pride ... But I was disappointed it wasn't more evenly divided."
