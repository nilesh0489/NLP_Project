In Brahm Stoker's book "Dracula", Count Dracula was a rather traditional, old world vampire who had a proclivity to choose young, naive and well to do English ladies (I presume a blue blood connoisseur) and shunned the blood of peasants and the lower classes. Flash foward to the early 21st century andthis type ofvampire has become modernized, institutionalized and targets the very poorest and neediest in our society. I have been a donorat CSL plasma here in Minneapolis for around 6 months.Monetary compensation was initially dispensed from an on-site cash machine. Unfortunately, this system has been replaced by a Citibank debit card on which the compensation is added to your card electronically. But, here is the corporate vampire Citibank has put its fangs into the blood of the poor. Here is a partialschedule of fees from the Citibank Prepaid Services handout that Citibank charges for using their card. There is no option to opt out of this program! Plastic Replacement Fee (if applicable)...................$6.95 per incident (First free) Not content to gouge the average consumer with exorbitant credit card interests and fees nor engorged by the taxpayer's multi-billion bailouts, the corporate monsters (is there any other?) are preying onour most vulnerable citizens. What future delights does Citibank and their corporate cronies have in store for us? For profit homeless shelters, food shelves and soup kitchens could garner a tidy sum in exploiting the poor. But hey, maybe in their generosity, they'll build work farms, company storesand relocation camps to allow the poor to work off their debt.
