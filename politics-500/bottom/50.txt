“For more than 40 years, California has led the nation in environmental regulation, from passing the toughest coastal protection laws to America’s first rules banning leaded gasoline.

Now, this week — after Hurricane Sandy pushed the issue of climate change back into the national spotlight — California will become the first state to begin requiring a broad range of businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas pollution.

At 10 a.m. Wednesday, the California Air Resources Board is scheduled to hold its first auction to sell pollution allowances under the state’s landmark cap-and-trade law.

The idea is simple: The state sets an overall “cap” for California’s greenhouse gas emissions, and companies must buy or sell credits to account for how much they pollute. Those that pollute more must clean up or pay more.”
