The White House has removed a petition from its website calling for anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist to be punched “in the dick.”

The White House created the “We the People” website in 2011 to allow Americans “create and sign petitions that call for action by the federal government on a range of issues facing our nation.” The White House has pledged to respond to most petitions that meet a threshold of 25,000 signatures in 30 days.

Following president Barack Obama’s re-election earlier this month, “We the People” petitions became a popular outlet for disaffected Americans, including many who wanted their state to secede from the Union.

Both The Daily Caller and BuzzFeed noted on Wednesday that one petition submitted on Tuesday asked the White House to “allow everyone to punch Grover Norquist in the dick.”

“Peacefully grant the people of the United States of America to have Grover Norquist be brought forth in chains and put in a public pillory,” the petitioner wrote. “Once Grover Norquist has been secured, anyone who wishes will be allowed to punch him once, and only once, square in the dick.”

But by Thursday, that page had been replaced with an explanation that said the “petition you are trying to access has been removed from the site under our Moderation Policy because it is in violation of our Terms of Participation.”

The website’s Moderation Policy specifically bans “[t]hreats of unlawful violence or harm to any individual or group” and “[o]bscene, vulgar, or lewd material.”

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore recently produced a get-out-the-vote video that included a senior citizen threatening to “cock-punch” Mitt Romney if Republicans stole the election.
