If, before election day, Barack Obama still maintained any illusions about the possibility of working with Congressional Republicans in a second term, he's got to be over that now, because...

When Obama tried to do the gracious thing--calling Republican leaders John Boehner and Mitch McConnell after accepting Mitt Romney's concession--not to gloat, but  probably planning to say something like, "I look forward to working with you," both of those "leaders" REFUSED TO TAKE HIS CALL.

From the New York Times:

Yeah, yeah, it was after midnight, and it had been a long day, and they're not so young any more, and they were "asleep." But even if the person answering the phone was Boehner's or McConnell's spouse. And even if it was a flunky or a bodyguard or a high-ranking aide, who had instructions not to wake the guy up: It was the President of the United States calling, for Pete's sake.

That is a snub, a willful insult, a deliberate, in-your-face political slap of epic proportions. And I hope that President Obama sees it for what it is and understands that nothing has changed for those guys, and that there is no way to work "with" them, because their immature, despicable, rude, disrespectful election-night behavior says it all.
