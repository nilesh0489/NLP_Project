When you consider how that in 2011, Republicans have promoted the Koch Brothers-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)voter photo ID legislation in at least 35 states. The Brennan Center For Justice has an exhaustive analysis summarizing that “Fourteen states have passed restrictive voting laws and executive actions that have the potential to impact the 2012 election, representing 185 electoral votes, or 68 percent of the total needed to win the presidency.” All of these laws are spawned by the Republican myth of “rampant” voter fraud, which has continued to be proven as a “problem” occurring in the 0.0004% range.

Beside using photo ID legislation to disenfranchise voters from performing their basic American right with voter intimidation efforts, Republicans and the Romney campaign want to use bullying tactics to scare voters from voting or make it more difficult. It turns out that the Wisconsin Republican Party is up to this vicious set of tactics and have been exposed for training poll watchers to use erroneous information. Some of the training materials found show what they are up to regarding voter harassment while hiding their own political affiliation at the polls:

Another component in the Republican dirty tricks arsenal has been to have ominous “voter fraud” billboards reminding voters of the legal penalties for voter fraud in minority communities in Milwaukee as well as in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio. Fortunately, many of those billboards have been removed, but the messaging certainly has been inflicted in those communities.
