Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has not been short on praise for the president and the administration’s work helping states, like New Jersey, besieged by Hurricane Sandy.

“The federal government’s response has been great. I was on the phone at midnight again last night with the president, personally, he has expedited the designation of New Jersey as a major disaster area,” Christie, one of Mitt Romney most reliable promoters this election season, told NBC’s “Today.”

In a separate appearance on “Morning Joe,” Christie again praised the president’s response to Sandy, “He gave me his number at the White House and told me to call him if I needed anything,” he said.
