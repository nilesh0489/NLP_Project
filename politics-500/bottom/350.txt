Conservative darling Dean Chambers, founder of the website unskewedpolls.com that purports to recalibrate political surveys to rid them of liberal bias, argued that New York Times polling guru Nate Silver cannot be trusted because he is a weak, little girly-man.

In a post for Examiner.com, Chambers sought to discredit Silver’s recent statistical analysis that showed Romney flatlining in the presidential race. Chambers, who rose to prominence by asserting that pollsters were nefariously skewing their results in favor of Democrats, insisted that Silver’s latest finding was more indication of that perceived liberal bias.

How could Chambers tell that Silver is an untrustworthy liberal? His lack of overt masculinity, of course.

“Nate Silver is a man of very small stature, a thin and effeminate man with a soft-sounding voice that sounds almost exactly like the ‘Mr. New Castrati’ voice used by Rush Limbaugh on his program,” Chambers wrote. “In fact, Silver could easily be the poster child for the New Castrati in both image and sound.”

While that may sound like a coded, presumptive attack on Silver’s sexuality, it actually isn’t—if you go by Limbaugh’s own definition.

As defined by Limbaugh, the “New Castrati” are men who have been, “bullied by women” and who have been beaten into, “total acquiescence to the liberal agenda.” Though Limbaugh insists it is not a term denoting sexual orientation, he concedes that it does refer to a, “lack of manhood.”

So according to Chambers, it’s not that people should distrust Nate Silver’s political analysis because he might be gay, but rather because he’s subservient to women and liberals and he also has no testicles.
