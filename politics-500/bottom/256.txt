Back in 2000, the Bush campaign was speculating a result that was the reverse of the election results: An electoral college loss while taking a lead in the national vote (If any of you remember, this is what the polls had shown towards the final days.) The Bush campaign had a strategy -- to not give up. To start a populist uprising, targeting the electoral voters directly. Causing mayhem. Do you think the right wing would try anything different if this was the case?

Vote. No matter where you live.
