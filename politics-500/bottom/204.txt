In two separate incidents, Republicans have been arrested for voter fraud. In Nevada, a woman voted and then went to a second polling place to try to vote again.

In New Mexico, another unidentified Republican was arrested after trying to vote twice. In this case, the offender was a poll watcher who tried to cast a second vote on a provisional ballot. In both cases, the system worked. The offenders were arrested and now face felony charges. So, one wonders, was it worth it?
