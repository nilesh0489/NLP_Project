A blimp-like aircraft emblazoned with an "America Needs Romney" message made an emergency landing near a Davie park this evening, much to the joy of many voters in Broward County, one of the most-liberal places in Florida.

There were no injuries, Davie police said. Except, perhaps, for Republican pride.

As the blimp went down, Twitter lit up.

"Just saw a blimp falling out of the sky. It says America needs Romney... Yeah right! You can't even keep your blimp in the sky," @swadedarling tweeted an hour ago.

"A blimp with a pic of Mitty that says 'America needs Romney' just went down in Davie, Fl. Could that be a predicament of what's to come?" resident Carime Hernandez tweeted.

It's unclear if the blimp was chartered by the Romney campaign or one of the groups that support him. Davie police confirmed the aircraft, which is technically not a true blimp, was advertising on Romney's behalf and did make an emergency landing.

Earlier, WPLG Channel 10 News (which displayed the picture above) reported about how the blimp was "turning heads" in Miami-Dade and Broward. "Flying high in the polls," the story said, "Mitt Romney was also flying high over the streets of South Florida Friday morning."

By Sunday, it was grounded.
