If conservatism were winning, does anyone doubt that Romney would be running as a conservative? Yet unlike Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, Romney is offering an echo, not a choice. His strategy at the end is to try to sneak into the White House on a chorus of me-too’s.The right is going along because its partisans know Romney has no other option. This, too, is an acknowledgment of defeat, a recognition that the grand ideological experiment heralded by the rise of the tea party has gained no traction. It also means that conservatives don’t believe that Romney really believes the moderate mush he’s putting forward now. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the conservatives are forgiving Romney because they think he is lying, what should the rest of us think?Almost all of the analysis of Romney’s highly public burning of the right’s catechism focuses on such tactical issues as whether his betrayal of principle will help him win over middle-of-the-road women and carry Ohio. What should engage us more is that a movement that won the 2010 elections with a bang is trying to triumph just two years later on the basis of a whimper.It turns out that there was no profound ideological conversion of the country two years ago. We remain the same moderate and practical country we have long been. In 2010, voters were upset about the economy, Democrats were demobilized, and President Obama wasn’t yet ready to fight. All the conservatives have left now is economic unease. So they don’t care what Romney says. They are happy to march under a false flag if that is the price of capturing power.The total rout of the right’s ideology, particularly its neoconservative brand, was visible in Monday’s debate, in which Romney praised one Obama foreign policy initiative after another. He calmly abandoned much of what he had said during the previous 18 months. Gone were the hawkish assaults on Obama’s approach to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Israel, China and nearly everywhere else. Romney was all about “peace.”Romney’s most revealing line: “We don’t want another Iraq.” Thus did he bury without ceremony the great Bush-Cheney project. He renounced a war he had once supported with vehemence and enthusiasm.Then there’s budget policy. If the Romney/Paul Ryan budget and tax ideas were so popular, why would the candidate and his sidekick, the one-time devotee of Ayn Rand, be investing so much energy in hiding the most important details of their plans? For that matter, why would Ryan feel obligated to forsake his love for Rand, the proud philosopher of “the virtue of selfishness” and the thinker he once said had inspired his public service?Romney knows that, by substantial margins, the country favors raising taxes on the rich and opposes slashing many government programs, including Medicare and Social Security. Since Romney’s actual plan calls for cutting taxes on the rich, he has to disguise the fact. Where is the conviction?The biggest sign that tea party thinking is dead is Romney’s straight-out deception about his past position on the rescue of the auto industry.The bailout was the least popular policy Obama pursued — and, I’d argue, one of the most successful. It was Exhibit A for tea partyers who accused our moderately progressive president of being a socialist. In late 2008, one prominent Republican claimed that if the bailout the Detroit-based automakers sought went through, “you can kiss the American automotive industry good-bye.” The car companies, he said, would “seal their fate with a bailout check.” This would be the same Mitt Romney who tried to pretend on Monday that he never said what he said or thought what he thought. If the bailout is now good politics, and it is, then free-market fundamentalism has collapsed in a heap.“Ideas have consequences” is one of the conservative movement’s most honored slogans. That the conservatives’ standard-bearer is now trying to escape the consequences of their ideas tells us all we need to know about who is winning the philosophical battle — and, because ideas do matter, who will win the election.

Bill Foster, member-elect of the U.S. House of Representatives, wants more scientists in Congress who can bring to bear an analytical mind-set to lawmakingOnly a handful of physicists have reached the halls of Congress. Bill Foster, a particle physicist and businessman just elected as a Democrat to the House of Representatives from Illinois's newly drawn 11th district, wants this situation to change. The Harvard graduate knows he is one of few in any technical field to hold national office. Foster plans to use his time in the public spotlight to serve as an advocate for bringing more of his peers to Washington.Although Foster left a career in the laboratory to pursue politics, science is never far from his mind. He says he is continually thinking of new ways to inject the rigor of science into the often messy give and take that is the essence of politics.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]Why did you decide to leave science and run for U.S. Congress?I often say that I inherited the family's recessive gene for adult-onset political activism. My father was actually a chemist. He got a degree in chemistry from Stanford. He came back from the war unhappy that his work was being used to kill people.When he came back from the war he decided he wanted to spend part of his life in service to his fellow man. He actually wrote a lot of the enforcement language behind the Civil Rights Act. Reading his papers after he passed away a few years ago was one of the things that triggered my thinking.There's a fundamental question that everyone has to answer: What fraction of your life do you spend in service to your fellow man? It's not something that science helps you answer at all. It's one of these questions like, Who are you gong to marry? Science doesn't really help you with the question.For me, the idea of not spending a significant fraction of my life in service to my fellow man did not feel right. And one of the highest-leverage ways to do that is to get elected to an office in the United States.How will you utilize your scientific background to achieve your political goals?It's very valuable when you're formulating policy to attach even a rough number to what's under discussion. That's an instinct that engineers and scientists have. In terms of getting the policy right, often you'll find that one of these arguments is quantitatively 10 or 100 times more important than all the others.What did you study as a physicist?It's high-energy particle physics, including working on the experiments that discovered the top quark.There's a series of heavier and heavier quarks, and the pattern stops at the top quark. The top quark has an anomalous large mass, so many accelerators were built with the idea that they would be the one to discover the top quark.And it was only the technology developed at FermiLab that would allow an accelerator to be built so that you'd have enough "oomph" to discover the top quark. Just having the accelerator isn't enough. You need detectors with the capability to handle the debris coming from the proton collisions.The top quark was heavier than anyone really expected it to be. It was the last member of the last family of fundamental particles. If it had been missing, it would have been a bigger mystery. It closed the chapter, allowing scientists to think about what the ultimate structure of matter is. It was the last quark in the standard model of high-energy particle physics and so it was the last step along that path.

There are two dirty secrets in American politics. The first is that the GOP is the real “food stamp party”. The second is that we already pay for each other’s health care in the dumbest possible way, thanks to Ronald Reagan.Every time an uninsured person waits to the last possible moment to go to the emergency room then incurs bills he or she will never, ever pay, that cost gets passed on to everyone else. Health care can’t be socialized because it’s naturally socialized. Unless we’re determined to let people die in the streets, we’re all in this together.Every other industrialized country in the world has figured this out and, as a result, they spend less on health care than we do while covering far more of their population.Obamacare is the first real step the federal government has ever taken to reform our broken health care system by getting a hold on the untenable growth in costs while saving many of the at least 26,000 Americans who die every year for lack of insurance.Governors will play a huge role in how their states are covered. They will decide by December 14th if they want to set up their own insurance exchanges that will improve competitiveness and access, if not the federal government will do so. Then, thanks to the Supreme Court, they will decide if their state wants to expand Medicaid to cover significant chunk of the uninsured.Republican activists are pressuring their governors to reject both the exchanges and the expansion. This will lead to a federal government takeover of their exchanges and millions of citizens remaining uninsured and passing the costs on to everyone else.The right has feared that the full implementation of Obamacare would turn purple states blue by giving millions of newly insured voters a vested interest in protecting their coverage. But, if Republicans won’t expand Medicaid, they’re creating an opening for Democrats in red states that will allow the Dems to speak to young voters and women, especially.It’s easy to vote or not vote against your interests when you’re trying to keep the gubbermints hands off your Medicare. But, when a guy who is actively denying you health insurance is on the ballot, you may find yourself prone to be swayed. People just need to be informed what they’re being denied.The GOP has gerrymandered their way into a majority despite getting fewer votes from Congress than Democrats have. But demographics are changing and Medicaid is expanding. If Republican governors can’t be convinced to do the right thing, their party should pay the cost.

Mitt Romney was really concerned that his "Storm Relief Event" in Kettering, Ohio yesterday would look like a dud, so he and his team stocked their donation tables with $5,000 worth of supplies at Walmart. The props, according to Buzzfeed's McKay Coppins, were things like granola bars, canned food, and diapers which were strategically placed to make sure that the photographs taken at Romney's "Storm Relief" campaign didn't a show very un-busy, un-stocked relief table (what else do you expect when you give people short notice to donate their canned goods?). But ... but ... look at how pretty all those fake donations look: And apparently, the event was so manufactured that they allowed supporters to use the donations which were bought by the campaign, to donate back to the campaign.  According to Coppins: Empty-handed supporters pled for entrance, with one woman asking, "What if we dropped off our donations up front?" The volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate. "Just grab something," he said. Two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each, and got in line. When it was their turn, they handed their "donations" to Romney. He took them, smiled, and offered an earnest "Thank you."Fine. Maybe it doesn't matter who bought the goods as long as they all went to people in need. "The campaign confirmed that it 'did donate supplies to the relief effort,' but would not specify how much it spent," reported Coppins. Want to add to this story?

For Mitt Romney, it's one scary Halloween. The Presidential candidate has just learned that tomorrow afternoon he will charged with violating the federal Ethics in Government law by improperly concealing his multi-million dollar windfall from the auto industry bail-out.At a press conference in Toledo, Bob King, President of the United Automobile Workers, will announce that his union and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) have filed a formal complaint with the US Office of Government Ethics in Washington stating that Gov. Romney improperly hid a profit of $15.3 million to $115.0 million in Ann Romney's so-called "blind" trust.The union chief says, "The American people have a right to know about Gov. Romney's potential conflicts of interest, such as the profits his family made from the auto rescue. ...It's time for Gov. Romney to disclose or divest."King added, "While Romney was opposing the rescue of one of the nation's most important manufacturing sectors, he was building his fortunes with his Delphi investor group, making his fortunes off the misfortunes of others."The Romneys' gigantic windfall was hidden inside an offshore corporation inside a Limited Partnership inside a trust which both concealed the gain and reduces taxes on it.The Romneys' windfall was originally exposed in Nation Magazine, Mitt Romney's Bail-out Bonanza after a worldwide investigation by our crew at The Guardian, the Nation Institute and the Palast Investigative Fund. [Ed. -- The full story of Romney and his "vulture fund" partners is in Palast's New York Times bestseller, Billionaires & Ballot Bandits.]According to ethics law expert Dr. Craig Holman of Public Citizen, who advised on the complaint, Ann Romney does not have a federally-approved blind trust. An approved "blind" trust may not be used to hide a major investment which could be affected by Romney if he were to be elected President. Other groups joining the UAW and CREW include Public Citizen, the Service Employees International Union, Public Campaign, People for the American Way and The Social Equity Group.President Obama's approved trust, for example, contains only highly-diversified mutual funds on which Presidential action can have little effect. By contrast, the auto bail-out provided a windfall of over 4,000% on one single Romney investment.In 2009, Ann Romney partnered with her husband's key donor, billionaire Paul Singer, who secretly bought a controlling interest in Delphi Auto, the former GM auto parts division. Singer's hedge fund, Elliott Management, threatened to cut off GM's supply of steering columns unless GM and the government's TARP auto bail-out fund provided Delphi with huge payments. While the US treasury complained this was "extortion," the hedge funds received, ultimately, $12.9 billion in taxpayer subsidies.As a result, the shares Singer and Romney bought for just 67 cents are today worth over $30, a 4,000% gain. Singer's hedge fund made a profit of $1.27 billion and the Romney's tens of millions.The UAW complaint calls for Romney to reveal exactly how much he made off Delphi -- and continues to make. The Singer syndicate, once in control of Delphi, eliminated every single UAW job -- 25,000 -- and moved almost all auto parts production to Mexico and China where Delphi now employs 25,000 auto parts workers.

There’s one big, but overlooked, development from the election last night: In Montana, a referendum to state that corporations don’t have constitutional rights has unofficially passed by a 75 percent to 25 percent margin. Initiative number 166 stated that “corporations are not entitled to constitutional rights because they are not human beings,” and thus is a blow to the Citizen’s United ruling that helped make this presidential election the most expensive one ever.Montana has been a leader in trying to buck Citizen’s United, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that equated money with free speech and allowed corporations to contribute unlimited amounts of money to campaigns through super PACs. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ruling by the Montana Supreme Court that limited political spending in state and local elections. That ruling, which came without a hearing as liberal justices wanted, only strengthened Citizen’s United, but now Montana’s voting populace has fired back.Montana has long had some of the country’s toughest campaign spending laws, which mostly crumbled under the Supreme Court. According to a nice background piece at CNN, the tradition has its roots in Montana’s mining industry, where copper barons used to buy off politicians in the 1800s. Because the sparsely-populated state is fueled by large mining operations, advocates worry that Citizen’s United will allow mining interests to take control of the state’s legislature yet again.It’s unclear right now what will happen next. While the initiative states that corporations are not human beings and thus don’t have constitutional rights — Citizen’s United was based on an interpretation of the First Amendment — any changes to spending rules in state and local elections are likely to wind up in the Supreme Court again, which may or may not prompt an actual review of Citizen’s United. (Some folks think that the Supreme Court is finally ready to take another look at what has become one of its most controversial rulings in ages, especially now that the election is over.) But one thing is for sure: In Montana, unlimited corporate spending on elections is resoundingly unpopular.

This is a huge scandal if it’s true.  Private prison systems are a huge grift, they’re morally wrong and they are costing taxpayers billions.  The notion that we are going to incentivize corporations to have more people locked up is a tremendous conflict of interest – especially when they’re busted paying off judges to send innocent kids to jail like this heartbreaking story HERE.  CCA made $1.7 billion in revenues in 2011, spent $17.4 million on lobbying and gave $1.9 million to various politicians in 2011 (source).  And now – CCA is just ceding control of certain parts of the jail to prisoners in order to save on costs according to the Associated Press.  Remember – this is a PRIVATE business giving money to politicians who conveniently sign legislation that benefits their business.   America – what a country.The Associated Press explains more about the lawsuit brought by 8 inmates from the Idaho corrections facility run by Corrections Corporation of America – the largest private prison corporation in America HERE:Eight inmates at the Idaho Correctional Center are suing the Corrections Corporation of America, contending the company is working with a few powerful prison gangs to control the facility south of Boise and spend less on staffing. The lawsuit, filed Friday in Boise’s U.S. District Court, paints the prison as a place where correctional officers work in fear of angering inmate gang members and where housing supervisors ask permission from gang leaders before moving anyone new into an empty cell. “The complaint alleges that CCA fosters and develops criminal gangs,” said attorney Wyatt Johnson, who along with T.J. Angstman represents the inmates, said in a statement. “Ideally, the lawsuit should force this to come to an end.” The inmates point to investigative reports from the Idaho Department of Correction that suggest gangs like the Aryan Knights and the Severely Violent Criminals were able to wrest control from staff members after prison officials began housing members of the same gangs together in some units to reduce violent clashes.If you’re unaware of how CCA operates – let me explain.  CCA lobbies politicians for contracts selling state prison systems for a one time infusion of cash.  And then they give politicians money.  For example – CCA gave money to  Arizona Governor Jan Brewer in return for favorable legislation; coincidentally – her chief of staff was a former lobbyist for CCA while his wife was an existing lobbyist for CCA (source).  CCA is the same private prison system that sent a letter to 48 states offering to purchase up to $250 million worth of prison facilities in exchange for a guarantee these prisons would be 90% full for a 20 year contract (source); seriously.We currently have over 1 million prisoners working for slave wages making products for Fortune 500 companies while in jail (source).  Paul Krugman explains why private prison systems are a bad idea HERE.  And if you want to understand how these private prison systems work … just imagine a world where you go to jail for owing money and then come out of jail owing more than you owed originally.We wrote about that HERE; I really think this is a must read – an excerpt:Three years ago, Gina Ray, who is now 31 and unemployed, was fined $179 for speeding. She failed to show up at court (she says the ticket bore the wrong date), so her license was revoked. When she was next pulled over, she was, of course, driving without a license. By then her fees added up to more than $1,500. Unable to pay, she was handed over to a private probation company and jailed — charged an additional fee for each day behind bars. For that driving offense, Ms. Ray has been locked up three times for a total of 40 days and owes $3,170, much of it to the probation company.

During an interview with Focus on the Family president Jim Daly, Paul Ryan reassured the anti-gay group that a Romney-Ryan administration will fiercely oppose gay rights. Focus on the Family and its founder James Dobson have a long history of promoting anti-gay policies and ex-gay therapy, and earned a shout-out from Romney earlier this week while campaigning in Colorado, where it is headquartered.While Romney has moved in his career from backing gay rights to becoming a vocal foe, Ryan has a solidly anti-gay voting record in Congress.Ryan told Daly, whose political arm has been spending money on behalf of Romney and a number of other Republican candidates like Todd Akin, that the ticket is firmly against same-sex marriage and that he was a “big supporter” of a 2006 amendment which enshrined marriage discrimination into the Wisconsin state constitution.He also said the Obama administration’s decision not to defend the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act hurt the “rule of law” and “contradicts our system of government,” however, a number of presidents including George W. Bush have not defended statutes they deemed unconstitutional.Daly: Focus on the Family has been behind the scenes working for years to defend marriage and to speak out for marriage and the importance of marriage. I think thirty-two out of thirty-two states where we have helped put a ballot initiative or some other mechanism in front of the people, we have won that thirty-two out of thirty-two times. It seems like when it’s in front of the people they vote for it, if it’s the state-level judges they will try to do it by fiat or if it is simply some other mechanism, the State House passes it without the vote of the people. For the Romney-Ryan ticket, when you look at marriage, what do we need to do in the culture to lift up and strengthen the very core building block of society and that’s family. Ryan: It’s the foundation for society and for family for thousands of years. First of all, Mitt Romney and I — I’ll just say it, it’s worth repeating — we believe marriage is between one man and one woman, that’s number one. Number two, you know where I come from we had one of those amendments in Wisconsin, I was a big supporter of it and we passed it like you say, where it’s put on the ballot it passes. The second point is, President Obama gave up defending the Defense of Marriage Act in the courts, I mean, not only is this decision to abandon this law the wrong decision, it passed in a bipartisan manner, it is very troubling because it undermines not only traditional marriage but it contradicts our system of government. It’s not the president’s job to pick and choose which laws he likes. A Romney administration will protect traditional marriage and the rule of law and we will provide the Defense of Marriage Act the proper defense in the courts that it deserves.

Frum, Schmidt, and other Republican moderates see this rhetoric as poisonous and, more importantly, false.“The federal government spends seven times as much money on people over 65 as it does on people under 19. The Republican base are the people who get the most from the federal government,” Frum said. “You can’t think if you reject facts. You can’t refer to minority groups as mendicants or moochers simply because they want the economy to function. We need to insult fewer people.”“When Gen. Petraeus took over Iraq, he said his goal was to wake up every morning with fewer enemies and more friends. Our goal should be to wake up with more friends and less opponents,” Schmidt said. “Political parties should not be in the business of picking fights with the gay community, we should not be picking fights with Latinos. We should talk about how the free enterprise system works. We should make a value statement about conservatism, that our path is the best way to advance your family and community.”Podhoretz described “a middle path between Steve Schmidt and Rush Limbaugh.”“If you look at all the data, close to half of the U.S. considers itself pro-life. It’s nonsensical to argue that positions that stand at a parity with their opposing views should be eliminated from the national stage — it’s a perverse idea, and it won’t happen,” he argued. “That’s not the way things are. This is a representative system, and those voices will be heard, not silenced.”But, he added, “The ultimate truth about this election is that if you do things that convince voters you are deliberately insulting them, then they are not going to like you. Middle ground means holding firm to basic principles while finding a way to talk about them that will not only appeal to more people but will actually convey the justice, moral power, strength and elevating quality of these ideas.”Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, who now hosts his own radio show, echoed the sentiment.“The real conservative policy is attractive to minorities,” Huckabee told POLITICO. “Our problem isn’t the product, it’s the box we put it in. Our message should not be ‘tailored’ to a specific demographic group, but presented to empower the individual American, whatever the color, gender or ethnicity.”

YAU (Yet Another Update): A lot of people seem to think that the intent was to punish any business that has need to layoff employees. This wasn't the idea at all. The examples below are making a very obvious political play, at the cost of their employees. It's pretty clear, for instance, that Papa Johns could find someplace else to make up for the cost of Obamacare, certainly at least in part. Additionally, if you are trying to save on costs, how does cutting hours back on employees make sense? The work is still there to be done, you'll need to hire more people to make up for the hours that aren't getting worked, so your HR cost will actually go UP, etc. If the idea is to try to limit your employees to a point where you can deny them benefits, I think this is also wrong. Additionally, it's not like Papa Johns is the ONLY company working under the new law, all the shitty delivery pizza places are too. They seem to be fine... wonder what the difference is?Update: Gotta run out for brunch... wasn't honestly expecting this to take off so fast! I'll be back this afternoon and will update the list. Thanks all!To Clarify: I'm not necessarily advocating a boycott, etc, as that would potentially just make things worse for the workers involved. I'm more advocating we spread awareness and generate some negative PR.addtional considerations: Sources are important. There is a post previously HERE (credit mr_majorly for bringing this to my attention) about misleading emails being sent around to make things look dire. Please check sources and don't just post blindly. I'll do my best (hopefully with the help of others) to verify information as it's posted.Please post company names, what they did/are threatening to do, and the source article.If this post makes it, I'll do my best to edit this section with names and source articles for every company.The list so far:Applebee's - Apparently Obamacare isn't to expensive to keep them from operating their existing restaurants, but is too expensive to open new ones?

President Barack Obama is better positioned to be that navigator than is his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.We come to that judgment with eyes open to the disappointments of Mr. Obama’s time in office. He did not end, as he promised he would, “our chronic avoidance of tough decisions” on fiscal matters. But Mr. Obama is committed to the only approach that can succeed: a balance of entitlement reform and revenue increases. Mr. Romney, by contrast, has embraced his party’s reality-defying ideology that taxes can always go down but may never go up. Along that road lies a future in which interest payments crowd out everything else a government should do, from defending the nation to caring for its poor and sick to investing in its children. Mr. Romney’s future also is one in which an ever-greater share of the nation’s wealth resides with the nation’s wealthy, at a time when inequality already is growing.Even granting the importance of the fiscal issue, a case might still be made for Mr. Romney if Mr. Obama’s first term had been a failure; if Mr. Romney were more likely to promote American security and leadership abroad; or if the challenger had shown himself superior in temperament, capacity and character. In fact, not one of these is true.Start with the first-term record. We were disappointed that Mr. Obama allowed the bipartisan recommendations of his fiscal commission to wither and die and that he and Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) failed to seal a fiscal deal in the summer of 2011. Mr. Obama alienated Congress and business leaders by isolating himself inside a tight White House circle that manages to be both arrogant and thin-skinned. Too often his administration treats business as an obstacle rather than a partner. He hardly tried to achieve the immigration reform and climate-change policy he promised.But economic head winds and an uncompromising opposition explain some of these failures — and render that much more impressive the substantial accomplishments of Mr. Obama’s first term.FOREMOST AMONG these is the president’s leadership in helping to steady an economy that was in free fall when he took office. It may be hard to recall how frightening that time was, as the nation’s finances were close to seizing up. President George W. Bush had taken the first steps away from the abyss, winning approval from a balky Congress for the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), but nonetheless he had bequeathed a mess to his successor.

I'm honored to serve the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate, and I'm grateful for everything you've done to help send me to Washington.When I'm sworn in just a couple of months from now, I want to fight for jobs for people who want to work. I want millionaires and billionaires and Big Oil companies to pay their fair share. And I want to hold Wall Street accountable.But here's the honest truth: we'll never do any of that if we can't get up-or-down votes in the Senate.Remember Jimmy Stewart's classic film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? I love that movie. That's what most of us think of when we hear the word "filibuster" -- a single passionate senator speaking for hours about legislation they fiercely oppose until they literally collapse with exhaustion.But that's not what today's filibuster looks like. In reality, any senator can make a phone call, say they object to a bill, then head out for the night. In the meantime, business comes to a screeching halt.Senate Republicans have used this type of filibuster 380 times since the Democrats took over the majority in 2006. We've seen filibusters to block judicial nominations, jobs bills, political transparency, ending Big Oil subsidies -- you name it, there's been a filibuster.We've seen filibusters of bills and nominations that ultimately passed with 90 or more votes. Why filibuster something that has that kind of support? Just to slow down the process and keep the Senate from working.I saw the impact of these filibusters at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Forty-five senators pledged to filibuster any nominee to head that new consumer agency, regardless of that person's qualifications. After I left the agency, they tried to hold Richard Cordray's nomination vote hostage until the Senate agreed to weaken the agency to the point where it could no longer hold the big banks and credit card companies accountable.That's not open debate -- that's paralyzing progress.I learned something important in my race against Senator Brown: voters want political leaders who are willing to break the partisan gridlock. They want fewer closed-door roadblocks and more public votes on legislation that could improve their lives.On the first day of the new session in January, the senators will have a unique opportunity to change the filibuster rule with a majority vote, rather than the normal two-thirds vote. The change can be modest: If someone objects to a bill or a nomination in the United States Senate, they should have to stand on the floor of the chamber and defend their opposition.I'm joining Senator Jeff Merkley and six other newly elected senators to pledge to lead this reform on Day One, and I hope you'll be right there with us. Our campaign didn't end on Election Day -- and I'm counting on you to keep on working each and every day to bring real change for working families. This is the first step.

According to the company "We deeply regret the necessity of today's decision, but we do not have the financial resources to weather an extended nationwide strike," said CEO Gregory Rayburn in a statement. Get your Twinkies and your Wonder Bread now, because what you see in stores is the last of them. (At least until the brands are sold at auction and revived.) Hostess Brands has announced that it will liquidate, blaming a strike by workers in one of its unions as they rejected a contract that called for them to make major concessions on wages and benefits. The workers had taken concessions to help the company survive a previous bankruptcy, and this time around when the call for cuts came, members of the Teamsters narrowly accepted them while members of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers union overwhelmingly said no and went on strike.  According to the company , it's all the workers' fault: Of course, Hostess management  had already claimed that the strike would be responsible for the closings of specific plants—when it had already planned to close plants even if the workers accepted the cuts and stayed at work. BCTGM President Frank Hurt says  the workers understood who they were dealing with:Workers were being asked to accept cuts, but top executives had gotten massive raises as Hostess was about to enter bankruptcy. Investments in the company's future that had been promised as part of restructuring after the previous bankruptcy were never made. And as for the management, put in place by the private equity companies that now own Hostess, Hurt says:Unfortunately however, for the past eight years management of the company has been in the hands of Wall Street investors, "restructuring experts", third-tier managers from other non-baking food companies and currently a "liquidation specialist". Six CEO’s in eight years, none of whom with any bread and cake baking industry experience, was the prescription for failure.This is a  Mitt Romney-style deal. Throughout the campaign, we read about Romney's  past deals that went very much like what's happening to Hostess. Now we're watching it in real time—and seeing how when workers fight back, they're targeted for blame.

The Department of Defense's office of training readiness and safety recently announced the Military Commercial Driver's License Act of 2012, which offers a shortcut to soldiers who drive certain military vehicles, the Armed Forces Press Service reports.The new law allows states to issue a commercial driver's license (CDL) to soldiers who are stationed in that state but not residents. Frank DiGiovanni, the director of the training readiness and safety office, called the new act part II of a rule passed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration that allows military drivers to substitute two years of driving certain vehicles for the skills-test portion of CDL training.Because service members move so often, they often don't change their residency with every new post. All 50 states have reciprocity agreements to honor licenses.Combined, the rules mean that a soldier who wants to move to a different state after separating will be able to test and get a license while still serving, and not have to wait to establish residency in their new state.DiGiovanni told the Press Service rather than encouraging people to separate, the military as a whole could benefit from the rules. First, if applicable drivers further their training in pursuit of a CDL, it increases the "professionalism of the force." Second, recruiters can tell potential troops that they'll be able to gain civilian credentials.It's one more way to make the transition to the civilian worldeasier for separating veterans, said DiGiovanni. The rule will apply to everyone in the active duty, reserve, and National Guard components of service. The specific licensing requirements are different for each state, so service members will have to do a little research.DiGiovanni said Department of Defense has a credentialing and licensing task force to help service members figure out their post-military job plans throughout their career cycle.

Mitt Romney’s campaign has been training poll watchers in Wisconsin with highly misleading — and sometimes downright false — information about voters’ rights.Documents from a recent Romney poll watcher training obtained by ThinkProgress contain several misleading or untrue claims about the rights of Wisconsin voters. A source passed along the following packet of documents, which was distributed to volunteers at a Romney campaign training in Racine on October 25th. In total, eight such trainings were held across the state in the past two weeks and 17 since late September.One blatant falsehood occurs on page 5 of the training packet, which informed poll watchers that any “person [who] has been convicted of treason, a felony, or bribery” isn’t eligible to vote. This is not true. Once a Wisconsin voter who has been convicted of a felony completes his or her sentence, that person is once again eligible to vote.The training also encouraged volunteers to deceive election workers and the public about who they were associated with. On page 3 of the packet, Romney poll workers were instructed to hide their affiliation with the campaign and told to sign in at the polls as a “concerned citizen” instead. As Kristina Sesek, Romney’s legal counsel who just graduated from Marquette Law School last year, explained, “We’re going to have you sign in this election cycle as a ‘concerned citizen.’ We’re just trying to alleviate some of the animosity of being a Republican observer up front.”This packet could cause major problems if Republican observers across the state try to enforce such wrong and misleading information on Election Day. Even if they simply slow the voting process down, this could discourage voters waiting in line and drive drown turnout.Here are four misleading or incorrect pieces of information distributed by the Romney campaign:Here are the documents in full:

Clearly Mitt Romney has decided the only way that he’ll ever be able to fulfill his destiny of bringing about the third term of Bush/Cheney is to run for Bush’s first term—or President Obama’s second.For anyone who remembers George W. Bush tripping over himself to agree with Al Gore, lying about his tax plan and rejecting “nation building,” Romney’s fey flirtation with the center is chilling—especially when you know Romney’s 17 Bush/Cheney advisors are stewing in the wings, tuning their war drums.The difference in 2000 was Bush had nothing to prove to his base and spent a year running as a “Compassionate Conservative.” Romney is banking on six weeks of approximating sanity being enough.Everyone points out what a brilliant strategic move Romney made at the first debate, as if it’s a good sign that we may elect a president whose expertise—along with avoiding taxes and exporting American jobs—is hiding what he’d actually do in office.But you can’t deny the success of Romney’s deception.The Obama campaign—as Romney ran to the right of Rick Perry and picked the author of the most anti-middle-class budget in recent history as his running mate—decided to brand the King of Bain with extremism. This turned his true flaw of “no core” into his greatest strength. He then shifted to the center with a deftness that shocked even the president.Now, all Mitt has to do is survive just one more week pretending to be moderate and he has somewhat of a chance of winning and taking the country over right as the “real recovery” he’s promising begins.But Romney’s one problem is that he can’t shut down the Republican Party until November 6.Following the summer of Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin’s “legitimate rape” comments, we got Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock telling us that rape isn’t God’s will, but the rapist’s baby is.What was Mitt Romney’s response? A statement saying he disagrees with Mourdock’s statement but will continue to support the candidate, allowing the ad he shot endorsing Mourdock to continue airing.What’s dangerous for Romney about Mourdock’s comments is the “God” part. While most Americans are religious, the extremes of the fundamentalist agenda are exactly the kind of issue that keep Republicans from growing their base.Here’s a reminder for the GOP: Jesus never mentioned gay people or abortion once. But he sure was pissed at people who didn’t help the poor.Yet who does the GOP target with their righteous indignation? Gay people, women and… the poor.

For awhile now, people have talked about how Romney donates a sizable part of his earnings to charity. Talked up by the right-wing as a sign of nobility, that Romney is a good person for it, they use it as a measuring stick against Obama.Unfortunately for Romney, the truth about at least some of his charitable giving is not so noble. It makes one wonder if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) was right this summer when he said, “I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for ten years.“ No wonder Romney refuses to release his tax returns.Bloomberg is now reporting that due to a grandfathered in charitable trust, the Romney family is able to effectively launder millions of dollars through what is listed on their tax returns as “charitable donations.” This form of tax deduction loophole was closed some years ago, but this trust is allowed to operate due to a loophole which makes trusts put in place before the new law was put in to place exempt.The idea behind this trust was to be able to put money in to it which would be granted to a charity upon the death of the trust holder. A noble thought. But in 2007 alone Romney withdrew over $40,000 from the fund, tax-free, while only earning $48. In effect, he is renting the tax deferred status of a charity, in this case the fund’s beneficiary, the Mormon Church.The fund was set up in 1996, just 13 months before Congress cracked down on the scam. That Romney continues to use it to this day thanks to a loophole speaks volumes of how charitable he truly is. He set the trust up in order to avoid a potential 40% tax on his yearly earnings of just over $1 million from  stock options he held. By setting up the trust, known as a charitable remainder unitrust, or “CRUT,” he could transfer the stock to that trust, which then can sell it, tax-free. The trust would then be free to invest the profits of the sale and earn money off of those profits.The Romney campaign has declined to answer for the abuse of the trust, with their spokesperson sating “The trust has operated in accordance with the law.” While technically correct, that is through manipulation and trickery, abusing the system. This will only get worse before it gets better, as it is clear that doing the right thing matters little to Mitt Romney. He cares more about figuring out what he can get away with “in accordance with the law.”He is literally taking the food out of the mouths of the women and orphans which the Mormon Church does in fact help, through their vast charity work. That Mitt Romney would then run on this very charity as a reason to vote for him, it speaks volumes of how shallow and pathetic he is as a man.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) praised President Obama’s work to help states battered by Hurricane Sandy as “outstanding” Tuesday, but cautioned that the recovery would be a prolonged effort.Christie, a prominent surrogate for GOP candidate Mitt Romney, said Obama had moved quickly to help designate his state a disaster area to better expedite federal assistance.“The federal government’s response has been great. I was on the phone at midnight again last night with the president, personally, he has expedited the designation of New Jersey as a major disaster area,” said Christie, in an interview with NBC’s “Today.”“Last night, I was on the phone with FEMA at 2 a.m. this morning to answer the questions they needed answered to get that designation and the president has been outstanding in this. The folks at FEMA, [Administrator] Craig Fugate and his folks have been excellent,” he continued.In a separate interview with MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Christie added to the praise, saying that “the president has been all over this and deserves great credit.”“He gave me his number at the White House and told me to call him if I needed anything,” he added.But the storm also presented a challenge to presidential contenders Obama and Romney with polls showing a tight race and only a week until election day. Both campaigns canceled events, with Obama returning to Washington to oversee the federal response and Romney calling on supporters to donate to recovery efforts.More from The Hill: • Obama, Romney mull when to resume campaign after Sandy • Sandy to suspend Gallup and make polls even more confusing • Democratic leaders say FEMA has enough cash for Sandy recovery • Team Romney buys air time in PennsylvaniaThe storm could provide an opportunity for the president to show strong leadership by managing an effective federal recovery. But Obama also faces the risk of assuming blame if anything goes wrong. With the storm hitting many swing states, including Virginia, New Hampshire and North Carolina, its effects on the election are still uncertain.Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) on the "Today Show" thanked Obama and said the president had done a "magnificent job." Malloy also praised FEMA, saying the agency had done "amazing early work to get us ready."Christie on Tuesday though signaled that recovering from Sandy could be a long-term issue.“It’s a major disaster,” said Christie of the damage in his home state. “We have over 2.4 million people without power across the state,” he said and added that there was extensive flooding in many areas.“We have a battered, battered New Jersey shore that I hope to tour a little bit later on today, but I think the losses are going to be incalculable,” Christie said.  Malloy mirrored those sentiments. "We've got a lot of work ahead of us," he said.This story was updated at 8:24 a.m.

The best laid FoxNews and McCain conspiracy theories bite the dust.  I wonder if this is one reason Romney backed off on Libya after getting national security briefings (or it could have been the ass-kicking he got from Obama in debate number 2).Ex-CIA Director David Petraeus told lawmakers Friday that classified intelligence showed the deadly raid on the U.S. Consulate in Libya was a terrorist attack, but that the administration withheld the suspected role of specific al-Qaida affiliates to avoid tipping off the terrorist groups. The recently resigned spy chief explained that references to terrorist groups suspected of carrying out the violence were removed from the public explanation of what caused the attack so as not to tip off the groups that the U.S. intelligence community was on their trail, according to lawmakers who attended the private briefings.No doubt FoxNews will ignore.  What an ignomineous end to McCain's career, although I'm sure David Gregory still will have him on MTP to babble his craziness.The names of terrorists believed to be involved were removed for reasons of national security, and all of the relevant intelligence agencies signed off on the edited text. As Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) explained to the AP, "[I]n an unclassified document you want to be careful who you identify as being involved." Susan Rice then relied on the intelligence community's findings to update the public five days after the attack, and everything she said reflected the best information available at the time.I think Graham and McCain owe apologies to Barack Obama, Susan Rice, and all Americans.  This is truly NOT good news for John McCain.Update I: From Annette K in the comments, Senator Harry Reid rejects McCain's bullshit suggestion of his own Benghazi committee and tears a serious chunk of McCain's ass.The second line in the letter is:And that's one of the softer things he says.  :-)  Give em Hell, Harry!

see more posts by Sarah JonesAs we head into the last few moments of the 2012 election, Mitt Romney has not answered a question from the media in 22 days.Here is the video of Lawrence O’Donnell on the last time Mitt Romney answered a media question:Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyMitt Romney hasn’t given a national television interview since sitting down with Wolf Blitzer on CNN 23 days ago. He has not answered a single question from the press in 22 days. Among the requests that he has turned down, Romney has refused to answer questions from children on Nickelodeon. He has refused to be interviewed and take the questions of young voters on MTV. Romney was so terrified of The Viewthat he canceled and sent his wife in his place. He has turned down David Letterman, and every major news network including Fox News. Bill O’Reilly has been screaming at the top of his lungs trying to get an interview with Romney before election day, but the Romney campaign made it clear on October 23 that they were scheduling no more interviews. However, this ban has also extended to the members of the press who are covering Romney everyday. The pool reporters covering Romney ask questions each day, and the candidate pretends that he doesn’t hear them. This has gone on for the last 22 days.The fourth estate is a critical pillar of our society, positioned to act as a fourth branch of government and one that is important to a functioning democracy. Even when our press is doing their job, they favor Republicans. The 4th Estate did a study between May 1 and July 15, 2012 that found, “(N)ewsmakers appearing in the media as partisan Republicans are quoted at a 44% higher rate than partisan Democrats. Additionally, the ratio of positive to negative coverage was 17.1% more critical of Obama than Romney.” What’s Romney so afraid of?Most media outlets, including the so called “liberal” outlets, are markedly more negative in their coverage of Obama than of Romney. The 4th Estate study results confirm previous studies showing that Obama gets more negative press than Romney, particularly when it comes to covering financial information like getting rid of oil company subsidies and taxing the rich. In other words, the people’s needs are already being compromised by profit-driven news.When a candidate avoids the press altogether, that candidate is not only allowed to craft their own narrative regardless of how far removed it may be from reality, but they also show an unwillingness to be checked by the 4th branch of government.The press is supposed to exist to help citizens make sense of the world. They have a responsibility to be the people’s watchdog and hence are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.What does it say that Mitt Romney won’t even answer a question from the press? He has avoided answering questions on his tax plan math, Todd Akin, Robert Mourdock and now FEMA. He has refused to ever discuss his church or his beliefs, an attitude that must be a privilege only applying to Republicans as we recall how brutally Obama was grilled about Reverend Wright.Mitt Romney doesn’t seem to value the basic tenet of democracy – the notion of checks and balances, as provided in part by the press. The press pool covering him are doing their job (unlike some of the Sunday show “journalists”), but he is just ignoring them.The curtain the Romney campaign hung in the plane to cut the pool off even further from the candidate was symbolic of his disdain and contempt for the press. After much pushback, the campaign took the curtain down. The press is the supposed to be the people’s voice, but Romney won’t respond to their questions. The only interview he will do is with a sports journalist on Monday Night Football the night before the election.

When anti-abortion fanatics try to sabotage other bills in order to get their way, it’s time to kick them out of office. Senator Rand Paul is one of those fanatics. The Tea Party favorite is willing to kill important legislation by adding a provision that defines personhood as beginning at conception, even though the legislation has absolutely nothing to do with abortion.Florida and Minnesota are currently being devastated by flooding. Flooding, as we all know, damages homes and businesses, and is very costly because many insurance policies do not cover this particular natural disaster. But the National Flood Insurance Program does. The program provides crucial aid to homeowners to help them rebuild their homes and lives. For years, Republican and Democratic Senators have been trying to work out a way to extend this program for the long-term, especially as hurricane season approaches, and they finally compromised on S.1940 which re-authorizes the government insurance program for the next five years, strengthens mitigation programs, reduces flood risk, increases community resilience to flooding, and creates pricing, eligibility and financial reform mandates to make the program fiscally solvent.You would think that every Republican in the Senate would sign onto this immediately, right? After all, it’s a compromise that relieves homeowners while at the same time fixes the program to reduce debt. Even the Republican dominated House has passed it.But Senator Paul doesn’t care about that. He’d rather wage war against women’s reproductive health instead. And that’s exactly what Rand Paul did on Tuesday when he threatened to singlehandedly block the legislation by adding an anti-abortion measure that is completely unrelated to the bill. Paul’s measure is a personhood amendment that would essentially ban abortion and many forms of contraception. Years of work on the National Flood Insurance Program re-authorization is being threatened by a lone Senator who apparently enjoys sabotaging pieces of legislation that are designed to help people. Rand Paul is a major problem child in the Senate. Many bills have been stalled or blocked because he decided that the Senate needed to work even worse than it already does. Keep in mind that this flood bill is legislation that both Republicans and Democrats agree on, which is incredibly rare in the Senate these days. So why is Rand Paul acting like a prick? It’s not like he has to vote for the bill. He can vote ‘nay’ or simply abstain. Is making progress such an abomination to him that he feels obligated to gum up the works when both parties finally find something to agree on? Or is he just so gung-ho about ending women’s reproductive rights that he’s determined to sabotage any and every bill until he gets his way?Because either way, Rand Paul is being completely out of line and is exactly the kind of elected official America doesn’t need in Congress. When an elected official blocks legislation just for the sake of blocking it or for some frivolous unrelated reason, it’s time for Americans to fire that official and hire one that will do their job seriously and responsibly. The US Senate is already horrible at moving critical pieces of legislation. Anyone who intentionally threatens to block legislation that both parties have endorsed is only there to make government not work and that is bad for the country.
