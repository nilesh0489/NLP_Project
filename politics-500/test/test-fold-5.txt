Last week’s Republican bloodbath is causing angst in a series of House leadership elections.The GOP’s problems with women — laid bare by last week’s elections — is the main undertone in the battle for head of the Homeland Security Committee between Reps. Mike Rogers of Alabama and Candice Miller of Michigan. That race, combined with the contest for head of the Republican Conference, is becoming a proxy for a larger discussion about a dearth of Republican women in power in the House.(Also on POLITICO: Full coverage of the war over the future of the GOP)To a person, key Republicans privately concede that Rogers has done everything right to become chairman. The same people also say Miller is likely to get the gavel. If so, she would be the only woman to chair a committee.“They don’t have to pick me just because I’m a woman,” Miller said in an interview with POLITICO. “I would tell you this, if my name was Bob Miller, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.” She said she thinks she would have it locked up already.Another complication for leaders is Rep. Paul Ryan’s return to the House. Leaders are expected to reappoint the Wisconsin Republican as head of the Budget Committee even though he’s reached the term limit for committee heads. That has others wondering why the party’s golden boy is getting special treatment.(Also on POLITICO: 2016 hangs over Paul Ryan's return)“I have told John Boehner that I will abide by what John wants,” Homeland Security Chairman Pete King (R-N.Y.) told POLITICO. “I was told that nobody would be getting waivers, including Paul Ryan. Obviously, if Paul is going to get a waiver, I will discuss it with the speaker.”House leadership elections and the selection of committee heads are always unseemly affairs. They pit friends against friends and force leadership to work back channels to boost the candidates of their choice.This year is not the worst by any means. But the tensions speak to larger questions being asked in Republican politics — like about the lack of minorities in top positions.For example, there are no Hispanics in leadership and one African-American — Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who will be the only African-American Republican in Congress after the defeat of Florida Rep. Allen West, who has yet to concede.In the race for the head of the Republican Conference, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state is trying to fend off Georgia Rep. Tom Price to remain the only woman in a top leadership spot. Republican leaders are confident McMorris Rodgers will win —they haven’t endorsed her, but some are quietly working to keep apprised of the race. McMorris Rodgers’s allies, both inside and outside leadership, want to see her battle it out with Price to show her internal strength.

Women -- along with a handful of undecided voters -- are pretty much going to decide this thing come November 6. The gender gap is at historic highs, and if solely women were voting, there’s no question as to who would be occupying the White House for the next four years.In the last weeks before the election, Romney has shown himself ready to get down on bended knee to woo the female vote. Which would be cute, if he didn’t have a record of denying women their basic human rights. Unbeknownst to Mitt, women, in addition to making handy office workers, are also fully capable of seeing through all the manipulations, mansplaining and malarkey that have been spread around this campaign season. So let’s pause a moment to take a look at Mitt’s continual war on women’s credibility.In the final presidential face-off Monday night, Romney seemed to glow with the fire of the global struggle for women’s rights. Right off the bat, he hailed the Arab Spring and the “hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life….”Maybe that glow was really the tell-tale flush of the hypocrite. Because the funny thing is, women can’t participate effectively in public life if they can’t get access to family planning services and find themselves thrown into abject poverty trying to feed too many children.Mitt has vowed that his first order of business as president would be to reinstate the devastating “global gag rule,” also known as the “Mexico City policy” --  a restriction originally hatched by Reagan that has been used to block federal money for family-planning work abroad to any organization that provided information, advice, referrals or services for legal abortion or supported the legalization of abortion -- even using its own funds. As the New York Times summarizes, “Merely talking about abortion could cost groups not only federal money, but also useful technical support and American-donated supplies of contraceptives, including condoms for distribution in the communities they serve.”President Obama lifted the global gag rule after taking office, a move that was a much-needed step in the fight to end world poverty. Mitt Romney has taken it as his highest priority to see that the misery factor for women around the globe increases the moment he takes office.Mitt’s plans for women at home are as cruel as those for their sisters abroad. Make no mistake: Romney will say whatever it takes to get elected, and then govern exactly as he pleases. In a Republican debate, he boasted of switching positions on a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy once he became governor of Massachusetts. He campaigned as pro-choice to secure votes, and then reversed himself in office to win conservative GOP support. In his own words:“I changed my mind as the governor. This didn't just happen the last couple of weeks or the last year. This happened when I was governor the first time a bill came to my desk that related to life. I could not sign a bill that would take away human life. I came down on the side of life every single instance as governor of Massachusetts. I was awarded by the Massachusetts Citizens for Life with their leadership award for my record.”For a mind-bending trip through Romney’s lies, switches and obfuscations on pregnancy termination, check out a video by Slate’s William Saletan.Mitt has pledgedto defund Planned Parenthood, appoint only the most anti-women judges, and reverse Roe v. Wade. He has lately taken to pretending that he cares about contraception, a necessary part of women’s healthcare, and in the second presidential debate, he said he didn’t believe Washington bureaucrats or employers should tell a woman whether to use contraception. Don’t buy it. Mitt backs the Blunt Amendment, which would allow employers to refuse to cover things like – contraceptives.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS — “Obama signs here are either stolen or shot. So sad in America people can’t have their own opinions.”At least, that’s the caption on an anonymous Facebook user’s uploaded image, posted on the Being Liberal fan page and seen above. Is it a threat? Simple vandalism? Based on the background of the photograph, this vandalism by firearm occurred in a residential neighborhood, showing a startlingly high disregard for human life. This is, at the least, reckless endangerment. At worst, it is a direct attack on the democratic process. Second amendment rights don’t give you the right to take someone else’s first amendment rights. Free speech is free speech.With the recent armed attack on a Denver field office for Barack Obama and the Tea Party-affiliated “True The Vote” campaign being criminally investigated for country-wide voter suppression efforts, it seems that the ever-more-radical members of the political right wing are getting worse by the day. Whether or not you think your personal political ideologies are better than the direction the country seems to be headed in, the United States of America was founded on a strong belief in the democratic process and the belief that a republic by democracy is the fairest form of government. Suppressing or intimidating voters is a war on democracy itself and is tantamount to treason.Both sides of the coin are wrong, by the way; voter intimidation or suppression from the left is just as heinous, although seems to be less prevalent in this election. In fact, there are almost no documented instances of voter intimidation and suppression from the left this election cycle.It isn’t difficult to find anecdotes of those that have been affected by such efforts:And the list goes on and on. When I see signs supporting candidates I am vehemently against, do I disagree? Yes. However, do I ever think — even for a moment — that I should move to vandalize their property, restrict their freedom of speech or intimidate those voting for the other side? No. We are a democracy. It isn’t up to me which candidates are elected. It is up to America as a whole, and that process demands the utmost respect.Here’s another personal anecdote, emailed to my public email address:This happens country-wide. I am begging you — do not infringe anyone’s right to free speech no matter how much you may disagree. This activity is simply wrong. If you have your own story about voter intimidation or vandalism, please email it to acuff.justin@gmail.com.I would be delighted if you joined me on Facebook for instant access to my articles.

Hi I'm Bill O'Reilly thanks for watching us tonight the far left running wild that is the subject of this evening's talking points memo flush.Far left elements in America are pump -- it up.Today a number of leftists met with the president at the White House they included much of the union leaders -- from move on.You don't get more left wing then the crew that visited the White House this morning.The president of course thanking them for their loyalty during the campaign but -- Obama should have included some far left media folks at group totally in the tank for him.On election night before most returns were and I said that's.Whereby twenty years ago pres Obama wouldn't roundly defeated by an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney it's.Is now the minority.And the voters many of them feel that did this economic system is stacked against them and they want stuff.Really see a tremendous Hispanic vote for President Obama.Overwhelming black vote for -- Obama and women will probably break -- Obama's way.Oh wow my announces was a 100% correct.In fact the factors entire coverage of the campaign -- accurate right down to not making a prediction.Because so many things are happening at the last minute.Now thirty minutes after I made those remarks which were -- a matter of fact.The far left website -- to crank on -- Centers reporting what I said they spun it describing my remarks as Morton.-- man it was the word to use I was lamenting.Quickly Meredith Blake -- totally incompetent reporter at the LA times pick that up also using the word.Lot of men in her article but also adding that I seem quote.Yeah I seem terrifying to you.Not writing in variety said quote host like Bill O'Reilly loud men thing.The shift in the US electorate.And the lamenting went on -- article after article after article falsely claiming that I was somehow.Wringing my hands rather than stating stage opinion.The America's change it is no longer in the controlled Obama white power plant it never really has been it's been a false power in this country.Was found it by Latin people.So now -- white power guy I went from analyzing the election vote matter of factly to being David duke.Isn't that nice and this happens all day every day in the far left media.And it's get serious.The Obama campaign demonize Mitt Romney as a predatory capitalist as a heartless man who even participated.In the death of an innocent woman.These people have -- not.But the worst part about it is no one holds them accountable because most people fear the far left.They're afraid of them because they are so vicious.So here's what I really -- meant.We're now living in a dishonest culture the media is wholly corrupt in this country it does things that it could never gotten away with even ten years ago.There are entire media operations that exists solely to promote I don't.That is getting worse.And -- Now who.

see more posts by Sarah JonesOn “Meet the Press” today, Romney surrogate Senator Marco Rubio confirmed a troubling fact: as President, Mitt Romney would sign a bill banning abortion.GREGORY: On the question of abortion- true or untrue? Governor Romney has said that he would sign a bill that banned abortion, should that come to his desk.RUBIO: And I think what he’s saying is–he’s laying out very clearly what his record is on and the exceptions that he supports. And there’s diversity on those in the Republican Party. But he has also clearly said he is pro-life. He has never run away from his record as a pro-life candidate or a pro-life governor before that. But he is setting clear what he believes the exceptions are that he stands for.GREGORY: But that he would sign a bill if, it came to that, to ban abortion.RUBIO: He is pro-life. And he has talked about how he is pro-life. He also believes in certain exceptions. And that ad you have just played, what it does is it identifies those exceptions that he believes in.This segment was called “Gender politics” and the “women’s vote” so naturally David Gregory and Mark Rubio were talking and that’s why no one asked the question a woman would have asked.The media doesn’t get it. Which bill? The bill Romney said he supported that made no exceptions — the Personhood Amendment? That bill, which is the only bill I’ve heard him support in the campaign, makes no exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother. This means that the common occurrence of ectopic pregnancies, for example, could result in the death of the woman.Rubio points to a Romney ad as his “policy” on what exceptions he would make, but Romney’s ads are not known for their veracity or even distant relationship to his actual policies. Governor Romney might be saying he is for these exceptions in an ad, but he has told his base something completely different and he said it on national TV.You would think this would be something to follow up on, but Rubio is allowed to slide around with vague exceptions because it’s not David Gregory who might die due to Romney’s whims.Romney tells the press he is proudly “pro-life” (what a joke — pro war, anti food and medical care for children, but “pro-life” because he wants to control a woman’s uterus) and says he would make exceptions but he tells his base that he supports personhood legislation that would establish the definition of life as conception. Which is it?Romney wants to defund Planned Parenthood (access to contraception among other healthcare screening), his running mate wrote the “forcible rape” bill with Todd Akin (of “legitimate rape” infamy) and now Romney is dancing around which bill he’s going to sign to make abortion illegal.Does anyone get the idea that Romney is mirroring the Congressional Republicans in that he has more plans for women’s bodies than he does for the economy?Rubio also managed to slam the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in a desperate effort to smear the act in order to justify Romney’s failure to support it. He claimed it would enrich trial lawyers. Your 1950?s character for President is clear — we are going back to back alley abortions under Romney.

Toledo, OHIO –  Mitt Romney may “celebrate success” in earning a $15.3 million profit from the auto industry rescue, but by failing to reveal the windfall in his federal Candidate Disclosure Form, he may also have violated the law.So says a formal complaint filed on Thursday with the federal Office of Government Ethics by the United Auto Workers (UAW), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and a host of other labor and nonpartisan watchdog groups.In Toledo, UAW President Bob King brought union activists in a packed hall to their feet with the complaint’s demand: “Divulge or divest!”King’s remarks cited the recent exposé in The Nation magazine that revealed how Mitt and Ann Romney had earned between $15 million and $115 million from the bailout — all subsidized by taxpayers in payments to the Delphi auto parts company, with the payday hidden in Ann Romney’s so-called blind trust.As this writer reported in The Nation, Ann Romney made a 4,000% profit on her secret interest in Delphi through a limited partnership with a hedge fund operated by billionaire Paul Singer. Identified by Forbes as one of Romney’s key campaign donors, Singer has given more than $1 million to the Romney SuperPAC known as Restore Our Future.According to lawyers for Public Citizen, People for the American Way, the Service Employees International Union and other signatories to the ethics complaint, Ann Romney’ so-called “blind” trust was, in fact, a ruse. The Romneys knew the details of their holdings, including their multimillion dollar profit from US Treasury funds. In the complaint to the federal ethics office, lawyers for CREW write: “Romney has not even attempted to meet the requirements for a federal blind trust with respect to his substantial equity holdings [in Delphi].”The Ethics in Government Act, according to the Nov. 1 complaint, “requires candidates for federal office to disclose their financial holdings so that the public can identify potential conflicts of interest and personal economic priorities of federal officials and candidates.”The UAW’s King said he was especially incensed because “Romney’s hedge fund partners threatened to shut down General Motors” by withholding key parts made by Delphi. Both U.S. Treasury and Delphi executives have said that in 2009, negotiators for Delphi’s hedge fund owners said they could force GM to close by withholding steering columns and other essential parts. Ultimately, the taxpayers provided the hedge funds with $12.9 billion in subsidies which pumped up the value of Romney’s Delphi stock from 67 cents a share to $30.“Romney made a huge profit off this extortion,” said King, “and the public has the right to know about it.”After King spoke, Ohio’s Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown stopped by the UAW hall to rally  get-out-the-vote troops for his and Obama’s reelection campaign. Brown told The National Memo that Romney and his hedge-fund partners “would extort everything if they had a chance.”Heath Lindsey, who hired on at Delphi Ohio 12 years ago, said that the company initially continued to pay his full wages even after filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005. But then the so-called “vulture funds,” which included Romney’s partner Singer, took control of the company. In 2007, they cut his wages in half, slashed insurance coverage—and simply abolished his vested pension.Lindsey, a father of two, said, “It destroyed me. I lost my home to foreclosure. I have medical claims I can’t pay. I’m just struggling to get by.”And Lindsey is among the luckier Delphi employees because GM purchased his plant and three more from Delphi. But the speculator group led by Singer eventually closed 24 US plants. The company’s filings with the Securities Exchange Commission proudly state that Delphi has not a single UAW union employee left on its payroll, having eliminated all 25,000 jobs.

WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pledged on Wednesday to change the rules of the Senate so that the minority party has fewer tools to obstruct legislative business.In his first post-election press conference, the Nevada Democrat said he wouldn't go so far as to eliminate the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for the chamber to enter and exit the amendment and debate process. But in remarks meant to preview a more combative approach during the next session, he warned Republicans that obstructionism as a tactic won't be tolerated -- or as technically feasible."I want to work together, but I also want everyone to also understand, you cannot push us around. We want to work together," Reid said."I do" have plans to change the Senate rules, he added. "I have said so publicly and I continue to feel that way ... I think the rules have been abused, and we are going to work to change them. We will not do away with the filibuster, but we will make the senate a more meaningful place. We are going to make it so we can get things done."Reid has gone down this path before, flirting with the concept of rules reform after the 2010 midterm elections. But he backed off the idea under pressure from some of the chamber's longer-serving members, including those within his own party.Sources close to the majority leader say the intervening time period has hardened his belief that the Senate is too dysfunctional to leave its rules untouched. And in an interview over the summer with The Huffington Post, Reid outlined the specific details of what he had in store for the next Congress."The first thing is the most important thing," Reid said the interview. "Do away with motion to proceed. Just do away with it. I favor the filibuster. There's a reason for the filibuster. I understand it. It's to protect the rights of the minority. The Senate was set up to protect the rights of the minority ... so that's the no. 1 issue, and the rest of the stuff we can deal with if there's a filibuster conducted. Those are the kind of things -- if we get the motion to proceed out of the way, we can debate it, one, to cloture. That's good. So that's the no. 1 biggie."Even with Democrats set to control the Senate -- indeed, even set to expand their current majority -- the avenues for Reid to pursue rules reform aren't entirely clear.There has historically been some debate over whether the majority can change the Senate rules at the beginning of each term, or whether two-thirds support is needed, per the Senate rules. The question hinges on whether the Senate is a "continuing legislative body" or whether each new term marks a new Senate. Those who want to change the rules using a majority vote argue that past Senates cannot bind the hands of future legislative bodies.Whatever the historical record, the basic fight comes down to numbers. No matter what the Senate chair rules, a majority can overrule the chair. However, that will likely be unnecessary, as Vice President Joe Biden is known to be a supporter of filibuster reform, and a believer that the constitution allows the majority to write new rules at the start of a term.Some Republicans may be willing to go along as well, hoping to have the rules in place for the next time they control the upper chamber, which could come as soon as 2015.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Saturday said he has ordered county clerks to open their offices on Saturday and Sunday to allow early voting for residents affected by superstorm Sandy.The storm devastated the eastern part of the state, leaving at least 22 dead and more than 1 million customers still without power just three days before the presidential election on Nov 6.Christie said New Jersey residents could get their early voting done over the weekend at the county clerk's office because he ordered the offices to stay open in every county in the state over the weekend."Time on your hands? Tired of cleaning stuff up? Go there in person, you'll get a ballot, you vote and hand it in and you're done," he said in a press briefing from the town of Little Ferry.The governor also said paper ballots would be made available on Election Day, Tuesday, allowing people to vote "old school" at polling stations that still do not have power. The National Guard will protect trucks set up at these makeshift polling stations to enable voting, he said.For those who are not sure where to vote on Election Day, Christie said that beginning on Tuesday morning, residents can send a text message to 877877 with their address and will immediately receive a response with their polling location."There's no reason why anybody shouldn't vote. We're going to have a full, fair, transparent, open voting process," Christie said.He also said the state will soon have more than 11,000 utility workers on the job of restoring power. Nearly 1.3 million New Jersey electricity customers, about one third of the state, remained without power as of Saturday, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.The Federal Emergency Management Agency will soon be working with those who are likely to be long-term evacuees, many from the New Jersey shore's hard-hit barrier islands, to find temporary housing outside of emergency shelters, Christie said.The governor also said he has ordered the natural gas systems shut off on many of the barrier islands hit by the storm because of the fire hazard they pose.

The Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio confirms to Whispers that True the Vote, a controversial, Tea Party-affiliated organization supposedly dispatching thousands of vote monitors to the polls Tuesday, has been barred from operating in that county due to improper filings.[GALLERY: Voters Head to the Polls in 2012 Presidential Election]Ohio is perhaps the most important battleground state this election. True the Vote had signed up to look for potential voter fraud at 30 polling places in Franklin County, a Democratic-leaning county in Columbus where African-Americans make up 20 percent of the population."Observer appointments filed by the True the Vote group... were not properly filed and our Voting Location Managers were instructed not to honor any appointment on behalf of the True the Vote group," Ben Piscitelli, spokesman for the Franklin County Board of Elections, told Whispers in an E-mail.According to the local Columbus Dispatch, the Houston-based vote monitoring group was actually barred because "at least most of the candidates who supported the organization's effort withdrew their backing." The Dispatch says True the Vote originally obtained signatures of support from at least five candidates for county office, in accordance with Ohio state law.In a statement on the True the Vote website, president Catherine Engelbrecht also says they were barred after being informed supportive candidates were "rescinding their appointments." Engelbrecht says this happened because of "lawsuits and pressure from [the candidates'] respective parties" to withdraw their support of the group.The Dispatch notes there are charges that True the Vote may have falsified or copied the supportive candidates names. True the Vote says those allegations are "dangerous and offensive.""This is a final, desperate attempt to deny citizens their right to observe elections," Engelbrecht wrote on the site. "The Ohio Democratic Party has projected paranoia on an international scale by promoting the idea that concerned citizens would dare observe elections to ensure a fair process. If the Ohio Democratic Party thinks True the Vote-trained poll watchers are legion, wait until it meets our lawyers."Elizabeth Flock is a staff writer forU.S. News & World Report.

News flash to Papa John’s CEO John Schnatter: Obamacare isn’t the only thing costing your business money.The pizza chain head has made his views on the Affordable Care Act clear in recent months, claiming the new health care law will cost his business about $5 to $8 million per year. To compensate Schnatter's said he will likely raise pizza prices and cut back some workers’ hours so he doesn’t have to insure them.Caleb Melby of Forbes has graciously done the math on Obamacare’s cost to Papa John’s and according to his analysis, to cover the cost of Obamacare, the pizza chain would have to raise prices by 3.4 to 4.6 cents per pie -- way less than the 11 to 14 cents Schnatter claims he needs.And there are other changes the chain could make to save some money, Melby notes, like not giving away 2 million pizzas for free at a cost of between $24 and $32 million to the company, for example.We're guessing Obamacare won't impact life at Schnatter's lavish home, a 40,000 square-foot mansion in a tony suburb of Louisville, Kentucky, that features several swimming pools, a private golf course and a 22-car garage among other amenities, according to CelebrityNetworth.com.“Who would’ve imagined pizza could build this," said former presidential candidate Mitt Romneyearlier this year. "This is really something. Don’t you love this country? What a home this is, what grounds these are, the pool, the golf course…. This is a real tribute to America, to entrepreneurship."Schnatter is just one of many company heads using Obamacare as an excuse to make changes at his company. Murray Energy's CEO laid off 160 workersthe Wednesday following President Obama’s reelection, claiming his company was in “survival mode” due to regulations and taxes Obama put in place. The reality: the coal industry, of which Murray Energy is a part, is in decline thanks in large part to a recent influx of natural gas into the U.S., according to the Washington Post.The owner of 40 New York-area Applebee’s franchises told Fox Business last week that he wouldn’t hire any new workers and would be cutting back the hours of some of his current employees as a result of Obamacare. Applebee’s parent company distanced itself from his statements as the company faced backlash over his comments.One super-rich CEO backed down from his threat to downsize if Obama was reelected. David Siegel, the CEO of Westgate Resorts and the man who tried to build the biggest house in America, said that he actually gave his workers raises in the wake of Obama’s win. In the lead up to the election, Siegel sent his employees an email warning them to vote for Romney or else.

Elizabeth Warren is one of the most exciting and uplifting Democratic candidates in many years. She is the voice of workingmen and -women, the champion of consumers and homeowners and the fighter for fairness for American heroes who wear the uniform, as well as their families at home. Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock will leave a different legacy in this election: They dramatize the Republican problem with women, and the Republican problem with rape.Elizabeth Warren will be a powerful voice for the people of Massachusetts if she is elected to the Senate. She is the true independent who is unbought and unbossed. She would be a breath of fresh air in the Senate. It is sad to see her opponent, Scott Brown, reduced to attacking her ancestry and trying to hide the fact that a vote for Scott Brown is a vote for the most reactionary Republican senators, who would have power over Massachusetts if Republicans do take control.As for Akin and Mourdock, the former talks about legitimate rape and the latter claims that God wants raped women to become pregnant. As for Paul Ryan, he has one of the worst records on matters involving women, from his opposition to pay equity for women to his advocacy of eliminating a woman's right to choose. As for Mitt Romney, here is the Republican shame:When Akin made his outrageous comments, Republicans, including Romney, rushed to distance themselves from him. And then they rushed right back to champion his candidacy. When Mourdock made his outrageous comments, Republicans did not even pretend; they stand firmly behind him.Are Republicans so hungry for power that they would say anything, do anything and support anyone? Women will remember on Election Day. As for me:I am proud to support Elizabeth Warren to be senator from Massachusetts.I am proud to support Claire McCaskill to be reelected and to keep fighting for farmers and workers in Missouri against Republicans who obstruct a farm bill, oppose pay equity for women and attack jobs bills that would help all women.I am proud to support Heidi Heitkamp for Senate, a courageous woman who fought for her own life to defeat breast cancer and fights for workers and farmers and consumers throughout North Dakota.I am proud to support Shelley Berkley in her comeback campaign that puts her within reach of winning the Senate seat in Nevada to continue her battles on behalf of Nevada homeowners, workers and consumers.I am proud to support Joe Donnelly for the Senate seat in Indiana, to succeed a great man, Dick Lugar, and to seek to end the gridlock in Washington that has done so much to increase our deficit and do great harm to farmers and workers throughout the Hoosier State.These Democrats make me proud. Those Republicans who speak of legitimate rape and who believe that God wants raped women to become pregnant are as shameful as Republicans such as Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan who support them.

Sandy — which was reclassified as a nontropical storm because of its unusual dynamics — came ashore at 8 p.m. in Atlantic City, carrying sustained hurricane-force winds of 80 mph or more and dangerous flood tides as high as 13 feet , the National Hurricane Center said.At least 16 people in seven states died as a result of the storm, the Associated Press reported.President Obama declared a major disaster in New York and New Jersey.By about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, Sandy was classified a post-tropical cyclone. Meteorologists said Sandy lost some characteristics of a tropical storm because of its collision with arctic air. But that collision also created an unsually large and dangerous storm system spanning nearly 1,000 miles. Fierce snowstorms dumped as much as 2 feet of snow across mountainous areas in southern Virginia, West Virginia and western Maryland, forcing officials to close Interstate 68.The storm also had an impact on politics, as candidates called off campaign events and election officials shut down early voting in some areas.Even on its approach, the effects of the superstorm were felt as flooding rains, gale-force winds and heavy seas swamped islands, ravaged coastal towns, shut down major transportation arteries, closed government offices at all levels, and forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate low-lying areas. The tall ship HMS Bounty sank off the North Carolina coast; 14 crew members were rescued by the Coast Guard, but one crew member drowned and the captain of the ship was missing.In Washington, the region’s entirepublic transit system— Metro, Virginia Railway Express and the Maryland Transportation System — came to a halt on Monday, and most federal employees were told to stay home.Federal officials announced that government offices would remain closed Tuesday for most employees, while Metro officials shut down rail, bus and MetroAccess service at least through Tuesday morning.Amtrak canceled Northeast service, while stranded airplane passengers dozed or played cards in quiet terminals after dozens of flights were scratched at Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport.In Maryland, high winds forced the closure of the Bay Bridge around 3 p.m. Monday. The Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge — which carries Interstate 95, the East Coast’s major artery, over the Susquehanna River — remained open but was operating under speed restrictions because of high winds. The speed on interstates and other highways was also reduced to 45 mph.

see more posts by Sarah JonesOn Face the Nation Sunday, Kevin Madden, an adviser to the Romney campaign, called President Obama’s term “Romnesia” “quite silly.”MADDEN: The very fact that the president has to utter a term like that just is a glaring example of how small the campaign is. The Obama campaign has not been one about the future. It hasn’t been talking about what they’d do over the next four years to really help rebuild the economy. Instead, they have reduced themselves to very small attacks like “Romnesia”, which is really quite frankly silly for the president of the United States, as the leader of the free world, to begin uttering.Coming as this does from the folks who have been sneering “ObamaCare” as an insult for four years, I find this perplexing. Is it Presidential, then, to jeer like a teen bully, “Death Panels,” “Democrat president” and “ObamaCare”?Romney can dish it out: The President isn’t “Anglo-Saxon enough”, false allegations that the President is cutting “welfare to work” — racist dog whistles of the lowest sort — but Mitt can’t take a little Romnesia.Romnesia is “silly” to the Romney camp, whereas grown adults sneering “ObamaCare” for four years and accusing the President of the lie of the Year (“Death Panels”) is perfectly Presidential.What this really tells us is that Romnesia hit Romney where he lives, smack in the center of his biggest weakness. Romney does not stand for anything other than thinking that he is entitled to be the next President. He shifts positions depending on the audience he’s speaking to, and after 6 years of this, it’s fair to say he has Romnesia when he denies ever saying what he is on video as having said just an hour ago.

This is a long post but it’s about something pretty interesting so I hope you’ll indulge …Like many folks, Occupy Wall Street has been some doing good work in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, helping people on the ground.Now OWS is launching the ROLLING JUBILEE, a program that has been in development for months. OWS is going to start buying distressed debt (medical bills, student loans, etc.) in order to forgive it. As a test run, we spent $500, which bought $14,000 of distressed debt. We then ERASED THAT DEBT. (If you’re a debt broker, once you own someone’s debt you can do whatever you want with it — traditionally, you hound debtors to their grave trying to collect. We’re playing a different game. A MORE AWESOME GAME.)This is a simple, powerful way to help folks in need — to free them from heavy debt loads so they can focus on being productive, happy and healthy. As you can see from our test run, the return on investment approaches 30:1. That’s a crazy bargain!Now, after many consultations with attorneys, the IRS, and our moles in the debt-brokerage world, we are ready to take the Rolling Jubilee program LIVE and NATIONWIDE, buying debt in communities that have been struggling during the recession.We’re kicking things off with a show called THE PEOPLE’S BAILOUT at Le Poisson Rouge on Thursday, November 15. It will also stream online, like a good ol’-fashioned telethon!- TUNDE ADEBIMPE and KYP MALONE (TV on the Radio)and other great talents including a group of radical nuns! I’ll be playing the role of JERRY LEWIS, emceeing in my tuxedo from MEN’S WEARHOUSE.This will be a joyful, positive night about people banding together and subverting a predatory financial system in order to help each other. BOOM! That’s a movie pitch right there, goddamn why am I not a Hollywood mogul?!Anyway, HERE IS THE INFORMATION about THE PEOPLE’S BAILOUT:- The LIVE SHOW is at Le Poisson Rouge on THURSDAY 11/15, 8 - 11 PM. Tickets are $25 (each ticket buys $500 of distressed debt).- The LIVE STREAM will be at http://rollingjubilee.org (you’ll be able to donate online)- The HASHTAG is #peoplesbailoutHOW YOU CAN HELP:- Spread the word! Share this info with your friends, family, and followers- Donate money via http://rollingjubilee.org$25 abolishes an estimated $500 worth of debt$50 abolishes an estimated $1000 worth of debt$100 abolishes an estimated $2000 worth of debt$250 abolishes an estimated $5000 worth of debt- Host a live-stream party!

PROVIDENCE, RI—United States Attorney Peter F. Neronha announced today that his office and the local office of the FBI will lead efforts in Rhode Island in connection with the Justice Department’s nationwide Election Day Program for the upcoming November 6, 2012 general elections. Assistant U.S. Attorney Terrence P. Donnelly has been appointed to serve as the District Election Officer (DEO) for the District of Rhode Island and in that capacity is responsible for overseeing the district’s handling of complaints of election fraud and voting rights abuses in consultation with Justice Department Headquarters in Washington.United States Attorney Neronha said, “Every citizen must be able to vote without interference or discrimination and to have that vote counted without it being stolen because of fraud. The Department of Justice will act promptly and aggressively to protect the integrity of the election process.”The Department of Justice has an important role in deterring election fraud and discrimination at the polls and combating these violations whenever and wherever they occur. The department’s long-standing Election Day Program furthers these goals and also seeks to ensure public confidence in the integrity of the election process by providing local points of contact within the Department for the public to report possible election fraud and voting rights violations while the polls are open on Election Day.Federal law protects against such crimes as intimidating or bribing voters, buying and selling votes, altering vote tallies, stuffing ballot boxes, and marking ballots for voters against their wishes or without their input. It also contains special protections for the rights of voters and provides that they can vote free from acts that intimidate or harass them. For example, actions of persons designed to interrupt or intimidate voters at polling places by questioning or challenging them or by photographing or videotaping them, under the pretext that these are actions to uncover illegal voting, may violate federal voting rights law. Further, federal law protects the right of voters to mark their own ballots or to be assisted by a person of their choice.The franchise is the cornerstone of American democracy. We all must ensure that those who are entitled to the franchise exercise it if they choose and that those who seek to corrupt it are brought to justice. In order to respond to complaints of election fraud or voting rights abuses on November 6, 2012, and to ensure that such complaints are directed to the appropriate authorities, United States Attorney Neronha stated that AUSA Donnelly will be on duty in this district while the polls are open. To report suspected election fraud or voting rights abuses at the polls, Mr. Donnelly can be reached by the public at (401) 709-5068.In addition, the FBI will have special agents available in each field office and resident agency throughout the country to receive allegations of election fraud and other election abuses on Election Day. The local FBI resident agency in Rhode Island can be reached by the public at (401) 272-8310.Complaints about ballot access problems or discrimination can be made directly to the Civil Rights Division’s Voting Section in Washington at 1-800-253-3931 or (202) 307-2767.United States Attorney Neronha said, “Ensuring free and fair elections depends in large part on the cooperation of the American electorate. It is imperative that those who have specific information about discrimination or election fraud make that information available immediately to my office, the FBI, or the Civil Rights Division.”

WASHINGTON ? For his first annual budget next week, President Obama has banned four accounting gimmicks that President George W. Bush used to make deficit projections look smaller. The price of more honest bookkeeping: A budget that is $2.7 trillion deeper in the red over the next decade than it would otherwise appear, according to administration officials.The new accounting involves spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Medicare reimbursements to physicians and the cost of disaster responses.But the biggest adjustment will deal with revenues from the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax system enacted in 1969 to prevent the wealthy from using tax shelters to avoid paying any income tax.Even with bigger deficit projections, the Obama administration will put the country on “a sustainable fiscal course” by the end of Mr. Obama’s term, Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Thursday in an interview. Mr. Orszag did not provide details of how the administration would reduce a deficit expected to reach at least $1.5 trillion this year.Mr. Obama’s banishment of the gimmicks, which have been widely criticized, is in keeping with his promise to run a more transparent government.Fiscal sleight of hand has long been a staple of federal budgets, giving rise to phrases like “rosy scenario” and “magic asterisks.”The $2.7 trillion in additional deficit spending, Mr. Orszag said, is “a huge amount of money that would just be kind of a magic asterisk in previous budgets.”“The president prefers to tell the truth,” he said, “rather than make the numbers look better by pretending.”Recent presidents and Congresses were complicit in the ploy involving the alternative minimum tax. While that tax was intended to hit the wealthiest taxpayers, it was not indexed for inflation. That fact and the tax breaks of the Bush years have meant that it could affect millions of middle-class taxpayers.If they paid it, the government would get billions of dollars more in tax revenues, which is what past budgets have projected. But it would also probably mean a taxpayer revolt. So each year the White House and Congress agree to “patch” the alternative tax for inflation, and the extra revenues never materialize.Nearly $70 billion of the just-enacted $787 billion economic recovery plan reflected the bookkeeping cost of adjusting the alternative tax for a year.The White House budget office calculates that over the next decade, the tax would add $1.2 trillion in revenues. But Mr. Obama is not counting those revenues, and he is adding $218 billion to the 10-year deficit projections to reflect the added interest the government would pay for its extra debt.As for war costs, Mr. Bush included little or none in his annual military budgets, instead routinely asking Congress for supplemental appropriations during the year. Mr. Obama will include cost projections for every year through the 2019 fiscal year to cover “overseas military contingencies” ? nearly $500 billion over 10 years.For Medicare, Mr. Bush routinely budgeted less than actual costs for payments to physicians, although he and Congress regularly waived a law mandating the lower reimbursements for fear that doctors would quit serving beneficiaries in protest.Mr. Obama will budget $401 billion over 10 years for higher costs and interest on the debt.He will also budget $273 billion in that period for natural disasters. Every year the government pays billions for disaster relief, but presidents and lawmakers have long ignored budget reformers’ calls for a contingency account to reflect that certainty.

A consortium of media outlets that had planned to sponsor the final US Senate debate abandoned the plan Tuesday, after Senator Scott Brown said he did not believe another debate was necessary and that he would not be able to reschedule the one that was canceled because of Hurricane Sandy.Brown made that statement ­after insisting for days that he was eager for a final face-off with Elizabeth Warren.On Friday he had said there was no way that Hurricane Sandy would prevent him from taking on Warren on Tuesday as scheduled.“That’s why I have a truck,” Brown told WBZ-TV on Friday. “You know, it has four-wheel drive. If she needs a ride, I’m happy to pick her up, and I’ll be there, providing the electricity is on.”Even Monday morning, when Massachusetts was under a state of emergency, Brown was resolute when speaking with reporters at the state’s emergency management bunker in Framingham.“If it’s appropriate we’ll have it tomorrow,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “If not we’ll just do it the next day or the next day. Certainly we’re going to do it, I think the people want to hear where we stand on all the final issues, a couple of days before the election.”But later that afternoon his campaign said he would not appear at the Tuesday debate, saying it was time to focus on storm recovery. While negotiations continued, and Warren agreed to a debate on Thursday, Brown ultimately said it was not logistically possible.“With only days remaining in the campaign, and with a long-planned bus tour kicking off Thursday through Election Day that will take Scott Brown to every corner of the Commonwealth, our calendar simply cannot accommodate a rescheduling of this fourth debate and the planning and preparation that would go into it,” campaign manager Jim Barnett said in a statement Tuesday.Warren’s campaign manager, Mindy Myers, accused Brown Tuesday night of dodging the debate. “Elizabeth was working with the debate organizers to move forward on Thursday. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, Scott Brown is again ducking questions about his record,” she said in a statement Tuesday night.The consortium hosting the debate, which includes the Globe, said it had offered multiple options to both campaigns.“This is very disappointing for all the citizens who will not have an opportunity to hear directly from the candidates a week before this important election,” said WGBH executive producer Linda Polach, who has been coordinating the effort for the consortium.The debate was to be moderated by CNN reporter John King and broadcast on a number of local TV and radio stations. It was to be their fourth and final debate, and the first since an Oct. 10 forum .It would have been the final opportunity for voters to see the candidates together, with the election less than a week away. A Globe poll released Monday found that 39 percent of voters had not seen the previous three debates between Brown, a Republican, and Warren, a Democrat.Both candidates canceled campaign events on Tuesday, but continued to appear in public, assessing storm damage.By Tuesday morning, Brown was sounding increasingly reluctant to reschedule, referring questions to his campaign.Brown said that in addition to a scheduling conflict on Thursday, there was no need to debate Warren again. “I had two radio debates that she didn’t participate in, so people know where we stand on the issues and I’m going to continue to do my job,” Brown said.Warren’s campaign said she had agreed to additional debates in Worcester, the South Coast, and a forum hosted by the NAACP that Brown had declined.“My view is that the people of Massachusetts have a right to hear from the two candidates for this important Senate race, a right to hear from us face to face,” Warren said during a visit to Westport on Tuesday. “We’ve had three debates but everyone was counting on one more before the election. I think it’s important for the people of Massachusetts to hear directly from the candidates.”

Nearly a third of votes cast in Arizona remained uncounted the day after the election. Most of them were probably cast by Latinos, organized and newly registered by multiple civil rights groups in the state to combat candidates like the notorious Maricopa County Sheriff, Joe Arpaio.On Thursday, the Secretary of State, Ken Bennett, announced the figures: 631,274 early and provisional ballots remained uncounted out of a total of 1.8 million votes. At least 350,000 of them are from Maricopa County (Phoenix metropolitan area), where Joe Arpaio has already claimed victory. Activist Randy Parraz, president of Citizens for a Better Arizona, told the Huffington Post, “We’re not conceding anything until every vote is counted. They’re just going to act like, ‘Oh, the election’s over, Arpaio wins.’ Hell no.”Three Congressional races also remain in limbo. Although Democrat Rich Carmona originally conceded the Senate seat to Jeff Flake on election night, he changed his mind after hearing the unprecedented number of uncounted votes. On Friday, he sent this message to supporters: “We will take every necessary step to make sure all of our supporters’ ballots are counted.” Two U.S. House races are also too close to call until the remainder of the votes are tallied.Protestors from a coalition of rights groups are maintaining a continuous presence outside of the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center. In a letter to the county recorder, Helen Purcell, the American Civil Liberties wrote that the “public confidence in the voting process” was at risk.The situation has attracted attention all across the nation. Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid weighed in, issuing a statement of his concern: “All of the votes in Arizona must be counted promptly, accurately and equally. The uncounted votes in Maricopa County alone represent a major portion of the total votes cast in Arizona on Tuesday.” He also pointed out that this problem occurs just as the Supreme Court is ready to consider whether the voter protections in 1965?s Voter Rights Act should be scaled back. Specifically, the justices are being asked to rule that the part that prevents states from disenfranchising minorities is no longer relevant.While Secretary of State Bennett tried to attribute the record-setting proportion of uncounted ballots to redistricting, the civil rights groups smell voter suppression. After all,Maricopa County gave out incorrect voting information to Latinos before the election, Jeff Flake’s senatorial campaign spread misinformation about polling places in robocalls and, in 2008, the ACLU called Pima County (Tucson metropolitan area) tops in the country for voter suppression because officials threw out 18% of the provisional ballots cast.So hold up on the congratulations for Arpaio, Flake, and a number of other office seekers in the state. Arizona’s got a problem. Perhaps the new Congress would like to take up election reform in order to find a solution.I’d be delighted if you joined me on Facebook or checked out my blog.

With Election Day taking place in the United States tomorrow (Nov. 6), Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney is getting exponentially more heated. As one of the few subjects that truly divides groups of human begins into two halves, politics constantly draws passionate statement from people of all backgrounds. One of those backgrounds happens to be playing bass and providing vocals for Motorhead, with the legendary Lemmy Kilmister offering his two cents on the election.During a recent discussion with Rolling Stone, Lemmy was talking about his inclusion for a Chuck Berry tribute concert. During the conversation, Rolling Stone journalist Patrick Doyle shared an experience he had while interviewing Berry, who teared up while saying, “My dad said, ‘I don’t know if we’ll live to see it, but one day we will [have an African-American President] – and thank God that I have.’”Lemmy responded to the story with a passionate statement of his own. “I would have said America wasn’t ready for it. And I don’t think they were, because they’re trying to drag him down now,” begins Lemmy. “I mean, the poor f—er’s only just gotten rid of all that George Bush s–t that he left, or is trying to. And he’s being stonewalled by the f—ing Congress all the time. I don’t know how he’s gotten anything done. They should be glad. I mean the alternative is Mitt Romney. Please, please don’t vote for Mitt Romney. F— him. Repeal abortion law is the first thing he’ll do. F—ing monster.”When Lemmy was asked whether he had been watching the debates, the musician responded, “I couldn’t bear it.”Be sure to head out and vote tomorrow (Nov. 6), but in the meantime, make sure you cast your vote for our President of Heavy Metal election. Lemmy almost made it to the final round, but was defeated by Rob Zombie, who faces Ozzy Osbourne for the sacred title.Vote in the President of Heavy Metal Election

President Obama on Wednesday criticized Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's controversial comments on rape, saying that the Indiana Republican was wrong when he called pregnancy resulting from rape "something God intended to happen.""I don't know how these guys come up with these ideas," Obama said during a taping of "The Tonight Show" in Burbank, Calif. "Let me make a very simple proposition. Rape is rape. It is a crime.""These various distinctions about rape don't make too much sense to me, don't make any sense to me," he said.(Also on POLITICO: Exclusive interview: Mourdock braces for fallout)Obama also laid out a contrast between his position on women's issues and Mitt Romney's, saying that "Roe vs. Wade is probably hanging in the balance" depending on the outcome of the presidential race and the winner's eventual Supreme Court appointments.Obama added that Mourdock's remarks are evidence of why government shouldn't make decisions on women's health."This is exactly why you don't want a bunch of politicians, mostly male, making decisions about women's health care decisions. Women are capable of making these decisions in consultation with their partners, with their doctors," he said to loud applause. "And for politicians to want to intrude in this stuff, oftentimes without any information, is a huge problem. And this is obviously part of what's stake at this election."Mourdock's comment, made Tuesday, has mobilized the Obama campaign and Democrats to call on Mitt Romney to distance himself from the Senate candidate.(Also on POLITICO: GOP splits over Mourdock comment)The Romney campaign distanced itself from Mourdock's statement on rape, but still supports the candidate and has not asked him to stop using an ad featuring Romney. "Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock, and Mr. Mourdock's comments do not reflect Gov. Romney's views. We disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest but still support him," press secretary Andrea Saul said.But other prominent Republicans are still weighing their options on Mourdock. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said his support for the Indiana Republican “depends on what he does.”“If he apologizes and says he misspoke and he was wrong and asks the people to forgive him, I would be the first" to support him, McCain said on CNN's “Anderson Cooper 360.”Earlier Wednesday, the Obama campaign released a web video juxtaposing clips from Romney's pro-Mourdock ad with Mourdock's remarks on rape. The video ends with message, "Mitt Romney: extremely conservative to this day."

This is a guest post by political scientists Brian Crisher and Mark Souva.In the last debate, Governor Romney made the claim that the USNavy is the smallest it’s been since 1916 implying that the USNavy is regressing in terms of overall strength. How accurate is this claim? We recently compiled a new data set on naval capabilities and created a measure of state naval strength for all countries from 1865 to 2011. As such, we are in a position to address the claims of the Romney campaign.Broadly stated, our measure of state naval power is based on a state’s total number of warships (non-fighting ships are excluded) and each ship’s available firepower. To make comparisons over time, our annual measure is based on available firepower within the international system in that year.  (For more information, see our paper here.)In 1916, the US controlled roughly 11% of the world’s naval power. This is an impressive number that ranks the US third in naval strength behind the UK(34%) and Germany (19%), and just ahead of France (10%). What about the US navy in 2011? In 2011, the US controlled roughly 50% of the world’s naval power putting it in a comfortable lead in naval power ahead of Russia (11%).The USNavy has decreased in absolute size as Governor Romney argues (although this decline has been ongoing since the end of Cold War). U.S. warships are more powerful now than in the past, as President Obama implied. However, neither the number of warships nor the power of our ships is what is most important for understanding military and political influence. It is relative military power that matters most. In this respect, the U.S. navy is far stronger now than in 1916.

see more posts by Sarah JonesWondering how we got here again, with Florida being a voters’ hell of anti-democracy and Ohio attaching non-certified “tabulators” to voting machines that Tagg Romney has a piece of?This is what happens when Democrats, young people and minorities sit out the midterms.In Florida during the 2008 election, 8.4 million people voted. In 2010, only 5.3 million voted. Margin of victory for Rick Scott? 1.2%. This in spite of the fact that voters knew that Rick Scott was the head of a company forced to pay the biggest fine in history for defrauding Medicare and other government programs. Reform? He is a Tea Party candidate. Only they would vote for a criminal and think it would work out well.In Ohio, Kasich was elected by 23.5 percent of registered voters and only won by 2%. His Democratic opponent, incumbent Gov. Ted Strickland, was winning in all of the early polls. Voters were allegedly unhappy with the economy and the state budget, and the race tightened.Remember when the Tea Party got everyone to think that the deficit was the reason to vote for people with criminal experience or a Fox News Channel host? Yes, Kasich had some experience in government in the House, but he had been a Fox News host for six years. Both probably should have been a clue that election time would be trouble under him.Nate Silver wrote about the “enthusiasm gap” that hurt Democrats in 2010. It was 8 points in Ohio and Wisconsin. That was enough to usher in Walker and Kasich, who have each done their best to destroy voters’ rights in their swing states.When you break down the data, minority and Democratic turnout fell in 2010. Having reliable turnout machines like Obama has plays a big role in getting voters to the polls. Nate Silver pointed that out in 2010, “What we’re probably seeing, then, is the “hangover” from the Mr. Obama’s turnout efforts in 2008. In states like Ohio and New Hampshire and Indiana, where Democrats registered tons of new voters and made sure that all of them got to the polls, a lot of them didn’t participate this time around.”Young voter turnout fell 60% from 2008 to 2010. “51 percent of 18- to-19-year-olds voted that year. In 2010, polls showed that young people were still supportive of Obama and the Democrats. But only 20.9 percent of them bothered to vote.”They didn’t vote because they were unhappy with congress and unenthused about the candidates, but guess what that got us? A much, much worse congress. When young people vote, they tend to vote Democratic. This is why Republican governors hired in 2010, when those same young people sat out the election, have been working so hard to disenfranchise young people (college students) from voting.I won’t get into how Democrats allowed themselves once again to buy into the Republican narratives against the change they sought. That is for another day, but it goes to show that morale is worth a lot. This is why Republicans work so hard to kill Democratic morale. It works.Many voters only think of showing up in presidential elections. Let’s hope that the widespread abuse of voting rights in 2012 will wake voters up to the necessity to vote in every single election, and be sure to fill out the entire ballot even though it’s a real chore. If you must, think of it like taking the trash out instead of thinking you’re going to get something great. It will pay off.

Early this month, a federal judge partially overturned Pennsylvania's voter ID law, ruling that the state couldn't require voters to show photo identification at the polls until after the 2012 election. But the ruling has not stopped the state from running ads suggesting otherwise—ads that have disproportionately targeted urban and minority communities that tend to vote for Democrats.In English, the billboard pictured above reads: "This election, if you've got it, show it." It is one of 58 billboards erected by Pennsylvania's Republican-led Department of State, mostly in Democratic-leaning Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Though Latinos make up only 6 percent of the state's population, about 20 percent of the billboards are in Spanish. Similar Spanish-language ads appear on public buses."The ad is really confusing and misleading," says Marian Schneider, the attorney with the Advancement Project who on October 2 convinced a judge to delay the state's voter ID law. At the same time, she failed to win an injunction against advertisements publicizing the law, but Schneider recently submitted a new brief asking the court to get involved. She believes the new ads "blur the message" and may dissuade people from voting if they do not have ID.Ron Ruman, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania's Department of State, denies that the advertisements are misleading. "In the primary all voters were asked for ID, and they will be again in November," he says, though he acknowledges that people will be allowed to cast regular ballots—ID or no ID. He explained that the department targeted urban locations to get the most bang for the buck, and because "there might be a larger number of people there who might not have a driver's license."Before the court overturned Pennsylvania's voter ID law, the state had already publicized it with TV ads, thousands of mailers, and numerous billboards and bus
