see more posts by Adalia WoodburyJust when you thought we knew all the Republican tricks to make voting more complicated, more bureaucratic and more exclusive, Jon Husted came up with an additional step.Four days before the election, Ohio’s Secretary of State decided to add an extra step to the process for people who are voting with provisional ballots.Under the previous rules, Election Officials had to complete all the paperwork that goes with a provisional ballot. But not in Jon Husted’s Ohio. He suddenly decided late Friday afternoon, to put the onus on voters to complete the paper work.According to a report by Brandon Blackwell, Husted ordered county officials to discount provisional ballots if the accompanying paperwork is not filled out properly. According to the same report, voter advocacy groups challenged this latest stunt by Husted in court. Fingers crossed that the Courts will smack down this latest stunt by a Secretary of State who has put partisan politics above his responsibilities to the voters of Ohio.Provisional ballots are used for many reasons, including if someone shows up to vote at a polling place other than the one they were assigned to. This year is also a special one for provisional ballots, thanks to Husted’s decision to send absentee ballots to nearly 7 million Ohio voters. Of the many people who have yet to return their absentee ballots, many may show up to vote in person on Election Day. That means they will have to vote with provisional ballots, and with that raising the probable number of provisional ballots cast. One may think that asking the voter to complete the provisional ballot paper work is not really that big a deal. When taken in the context of Husted’s other shenanigans, this is a huge deal.Thanks to Husted, there will probably be a lot more people voting with provisional ballots, and with it, more people taking more time to vote, since it does take additional time to complete the paperwork. I would venture to say that Husted is counting on voters making some sort of error while completing the paper work, which means of course, that their vote will not be counted. Also, there will be long delays, which may in itself discourage people from voting.There’s still time to vote early, even under the restricted hours that Husted put in place after he was ordered to reinstate early voting during the last three days before the election. Husted set up a double booby-trap with this series of moves, so the best way to avoid falling in his trap, if you have an absentee ballot, vote absentee.The deadline for returning a completed ballot by mail is 12:01 a.m. November 6th and if the ballot is received by the board of elections no later than 10 days following the election.You or an eligible family member can deliver your completed ballot, which must be sealed in a completed and signed identification, to the board of elections in person. The deadline is 7:30 p.m. on Election Day.This man can talk all he wants about a desire to maintain election integrity and making voting easier. In reality, we’re seeing a systematic effort by Husted to gum up the voting process, and find any possibility to invalidate votes. He’s not only a sorry excuse for a Secretary of State, he’s a sorry excuse for a human being.

Judging from recent experience, close presidential elections tend to coincide with problems at the polls. Remember the 2000 election's butterfly ballots and dangling chads? Or, four years later, the 10-hour lines in Knox County, Ohio? Though civil rights groups worry that history will again repeat itself this year, at least one thing will be different: what's in our pockets. Anybody with a smartphone can now shoot video of polling irregularities and upload it to the internet. But someone must still curate all of this citizen journalism, and that's where a group called Video the Vote comes in.A member of a network of voting rights groups known as the Election Protection Coalition, Video the Vote wants anybody who notices voting problems to document the situation and bring the footage to its attention. "In an era of partisan voter purges, onerous ID requirements, and organized intimidation, it's not enough for citizens to just cast their ballots," says Matt Pascarella, Video the Vote's campaign director. In addition to collecting citizen uploads, he'll field a national network of his own videographers to target swing-state hotspots.You might end up seeing some of these videos on the Mother Jones website; I'll be embedded with Video the Vote office during much of Election Day. In addition, Mother Jones is encouraging readers to report any poll problems, voter intimidation, and vote suppression attempts you might encounter via our short Report Your Voting Problem form (available below). We're tracking problems at our interactive map and mega-guide to election problems.For more on how to work with Video the Vote, check out the group's promotional video:You can help Mother Jones track voter suppression and poll problems around the country—report your problem using this short form:

(Washington, DC – Nov. 7, 2012) – The winners in yesterday’s U.S. House races are being asked by non-religious Americans to keep their distance from the Congressional Prayer Caucus.In a letter sent today by the American Humanist Association (AHA) to all members-elect of the U.S. House of Representatives, the AHA is asking them “not to join the Congressional Prayer Caucus and to actively work to ensure that the wall of separation between church and state is strengthened and maintained.”“Members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus have repeatedly introduced and supported legislation that many secular Americans feel is unconstitutional and often favors Christianity above all other religions,” said American Humanist Association Executive Director Roy Speckhardt.The Congressional Prayer Caucus was founded in 2005 by Representative J. Randy Forbes (VA) to “preserve the presence of religion, faith, and morality in the marketplace of ideas.” According to the Congressional Prayer Caucus website, current issues for the Caucus include “supporting the freedom of school boards to open meetings with prayer,” “urging the President to preserve religious hiring rights,” and “affirming America’s rich spiritual heritage.”Members of the Prayer Caucus have supported legislation such as H.Con.Res.121, which called on the President to designate 2010 as “The National Year of the Bible” and “acknowledge the importance of the Bible in American society.” Prayer Caucus members have also signed on to amicus curiae briefs in court cases in support of Christian crosses on public land.  “Incoming House members should know that approximately one in five of their constituents are not religiously affiliated, and even more insist on maintaining the wall of separation between church and state,” Speckhardt continued. “Secular Americans are ready to work with all members of the 113 Congress, regardless of their personal beliefs, if they agree on this basic constitutional principle.”The letter can be found online here: http://www.americanhumanist.org/system/storage/63/a7/3/3494/CPC_Letter.pdfThe American Humanist Association (www.AmericanHumanist.org) advocates for the rights and viewpoints of humanists. Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Washington, DC, its work is extended through more than 150 local chapters and affiliates across America.  Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism, affirms our responsibility to lead ethical lives of value to self and humanity.Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism, affirms our responsibility to lead ethical lives of value to self and humanity.

Former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan says that his party lost the White House in 2012 because so many “urban” voters went to the polls, not because Americans rejected his Medicare and other budget policies.“We were surprised with the outcome,” the Wisconsin Republican told WISC-TV’s Jessica Arp. “We knew this was going to be a close race. We thought we had a very good chance of winning it. I think that the surprise was some of the turnout, some of the turnout especially in urban areas, which definitely gave President Obama the big margin to win this race.”“There’s always an Electoral College strategy to winning these things, and you know what states you need to win to get to 270 electoral votes. When we watched Virginia and Ohio coming in, those as tight as they were, and looking like we were going to lose them, that’s when it became clear we weren’t going to win.”Ryan added that it was “disappointing” because “losing never feels good,” but insisted that the race had not been a referendum on his budget plan, which would have slashed the size of government and turned Medicare into a voucher program.“I don’t think we lost it on those budget issues, especially on Medicare,” the former nominee explained. “We clearly didn’t lose it on those issues. I think what people want us to do is tackle the country’s problems, and what I got out of this is they don’t want only Republican ideas or only Democratic ideas, they want us to come together for common ground and to work this out.”Although exit polls showed that six in ten voters wanted tax rates to be raised, Ryan said he didn’t believe that was what Americans really voted for.“I don’t know if I agree with that because we have divided government,” he remarked. “They also voted for House Republicans to maintain their majority, which took a very clear stand against that.”

see more posts by Adalia WoodburyAccording to Talking Points Memo, three Democratic Members of the House of Representatives asked Eric Holder to order an investigation into alleged tampering in voter registration drives by Strategic Allied Consulting and Pinpoint. Both companies are owned by Republican operative Nathan Sproul and both companies were hired by the RNC.Reps. Jim Moran, Bobby Scott and Gerry Connolly, all of Virginia, wrote a letter to the Attorney-General which says in part:Our inquiry is prompted by the recent media reports that an employee of Pinpoint, a subsidiary of Strategic Allied Consulting, was charged in Rockingham County, Virginia with 13 counts of destruction of voter registration applications, disclosure of voter registration information, and obstruction of justice. We note that in addition to its Rockingham County operation, Pinpoint is reportedly operating in at least five other jurisdictions in Virginia: Chesapeake City, Fairfax County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, and Virginia Beach. We also note that prior to drawing a paycheck from Pinpoint, the charged individual was under the direct employ of Strategic Allied Consulting. As you are aware, Strategic Allied Consulting is currently under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and faces more than 200 allegations of voter registration fraud including registration of the deceased. Allegations of voter registration fraud by Strategic Allied Consulting also have been raised in Arizona and Colorado. The number of allegations in a multitude of locations would seem to suggest something more than the isolated acts of “a few bad apples.The Department of Justice reportedly acknowledges receiving the letter, but has no comment at this time.NBC reports “Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said in a letter Monday that his ‘hands are tied’ and that he could not launch an investigation into the alleged destruction of voter registration forms without a formal request from one of three sources: the State Board of Elections, a local commonwealth’s attorney or a local electoral board member.”We also know that the official in the impacted county doesn’t believe when an individual employed by a Republican strategist and dumps Democrats’ registration forms that it could be politically motivated.We do know that the RNC paid Sproul’s companies millions of dollars for their services. We also know, according to Sproul, the RNC requested that he establish a new company given the political baggage from his services in previous elections.Finally, we know that the RNC ordered State level officials to hire Sproul’s companies.As I reported previously, State officials in Florida and Virginiaare reluctant to investigate the alleged election fraud occurring in their states. It’s time for the DOJ to step in and get to the bottom of this attack on our electoral system.

On Wednesday, Obama will travel to New Jersey to tour damaged areas with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, a regular critic of the president who heaped praise on him in the aftermath of the storm, saying that “the president has been all over this and he deserves great credit.”The collaboration between Christie and Obama provided a stark contrast from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when President George W. Bush’s administration and that of Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco (D) engaged in a bitter round of finger-pointing over the botched handling of the disaster.The storm thrust Romney in the almost impossible position of trying to write a role for himself in the story that has gripped the nation’s attention. The GOP nominee held a relief event in Ohio to collect donations for storm victims, but the event had the trappings of a regular campaign rally, with the candidate’s standard theme music and biographical video. As Romney packed emergency supplies, he did not respond to reporters who asked whether he is reconsidering his earlier assertion that disaster management is a job that should be turned over to the states.Obama’s performance could be viewed quite differently as federal relief efforts continue to play out. Whatever problems arise will largely be Obama’s to bear, just as Bush was blamed for Katrina.“The storm is not over yet,” Obama cautioned during a Tuesday afternoon visit to the headquarters of the Red Cross in Washington. “We’re going to continue to push as hard as we can” to provide resources, he added, before emphasizing that his message to his administration is “no bureaucracy, no red tape.”The storm also calls attention to a dynamic that all incumbents face: how to balance being president while running for reelection. Rarely, if ever, has a president had to deal with such a major disaster so close to Election Day, and any misstep or move that appears politically motivated could cost Obama with voters.For now, the president’s Chicago-based reelection team is exhibiting no urgency to return him to the campaign trail. The campaign canceled two rallies in Ohio on Wednesday, and one aide said Obama’s schedule is being determined by the president, along with White House advisers such as David Plouffe and Chief of Staff Jacob Lew.This aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about internal strategy, suggested that at this point, the rallies are marginally helpful in getting supporters to vote, but that otherwise “the race is set.”

As the US Eastern Seaboard struggles to come to terms with the impact of Tropical Storm Sandy, presidential election campaigning has been temporarily suspended. “The election can take of itself,” Barack Obama said yesterday evening.At least, I thought it had been suspended. But I was wrong. The election can’t take care of itself after all.It’s just been announced that Mitt Romney is to attend a “storm relief event”. His vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan will attend a separate event to “thank volunteers”. And his wife Ann Romneywill be appearing at her own separate “storm relief events”.All good, non-partisan stuff. Except Paul Ryan isn’t thanking volunteers in New York or Atlantic City. He’s thanking them in the in the pivotal swing state of Wisconsin. And he’s not thanking volunteers actually involved in the relief effort (they’re too busy trying to bring relief to people). He’s thanking people who are collecting supplies for the relief effort. And they, entirely coincidently, happen to be collecting those supplies in one of the “firewall” states he and Mitt Romney have to win next Tuesday.And Anne Romney? As I said, she’s attending two “storm relief events” of her own. And where are they being held? Well, knock me down with a feather. Or a hurricane. Anne’s off to Wisconsin and Iowa. Again, neither significantly affected by Sandy. But both vital to her husband's election chances.What about Mitt Romney himself? His “relief event” is taking place – again purely by chance – in Ohio. Yes, that just happens to be the same Ohio every commentator acknowledges he has to win if he wants to win the White House. But let me reiterate, it’s not an election rally. The USA Today story reporting his itinerary makes that perfectly clear. “The GOP presidential ticket cancelled its scheduled campaign rallies out of sensitivity for the millions of people in the storm's path,” it takes care to remind us.The fact that Romney is being joined by “race car driver Richard Petty and country singer Randy Owen”, is, again, a mere quirk of fate. And were I to find myself coordinating the response to a major natural disaster, the first group I would turn to would be my crack team of rapid-response country and western vocalists.Am I being too cynical? Perhaps I am. Mitt Romney has an election to win, and Barack Obama is going to get the next 72 hours to swan around looking presidential.But I thought Mitt Romney and his supporters shunned petty politicking at these times of great national crisis. It was Mitt Romney who said in the second presidential debate: “I find more troubling than this, that on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador – the first time that’s happened since 1979 – when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the President, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser.” Ah. But flying off to Ohio for a political photocall – sorry, but who are we kidding – less than 24 hours after 16 Americans have been killed in the worst storm in a generation is just fine.Perhaps the election will be able to take care of itself for a couple of days. But if it can’t, don’t worry. Mitt Romney will be on hand just in case.

If the election results were disappointing for Republicans nationally, they were devastating for the GOP in California.It wasn't just President Obama's 21-point margin of victory. California Democrats gained four seats in Congress and will have two-thirds majorities in both houses of the state Legislature. But the struggles of the California Republican Party began long before last week.In the past, Republicans have made history in California — there was the Reagan Revolution and Proposition 13, known as the "taxpayers revolt." But just before this election, California Republicans made history of a different sort.It wasn't the kind of history anyone would brag about, says Dan Schnur, head of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California."When one of the two major parties sees its voter registration dip below 30 percent, that ought to be a warning sign that Election Day is not going to go particularly well," Schnur says.That's right — just 29.4 percent of California voters are now registered Republicans. Meanwhile, a growing number of all voters in California are Latino, now more than one-fifth of the electorate.In the past couple of elections, Latinos around the country voted roughly 2 to 1 for Democrats. But in California, Latinos have been fleeing the Republican Party since this ad ran in 1994:"They keep coming," the ad said. "Two million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government won't stop them at the border."Then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, hitched his re-election campaign to Proposition 187, which denied public services for illegal immigrants. That included banning children from public schools.And even though Proposition 187 was thrown out by the courts, "the bill is coming due," says Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. "This has mobilized vast numbers of Latino voters. Now they're really pouring to the polls."The growing Latino vote definitely got the attention of Republicans on the national stage. Last Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the GOP must change its tune on immigration reform or risk further losses in the nation's fastest-growing voter group."We have nobody to blame but ourselves when it comes to losing Hispanics," he said, "and we can get them back with some effort on our part."Graham proposed an immigration overhaul that included a path to citizenship. But California Republicans may not embrace that shift in policy."That's seen by many folks as rewarding people who've cheated the system, at the expense of people who've gone through the system legally," says Ron Nehring, a GOP strategist who was chairman of the state Republican Party until this year.Reaching out to Latinos won't by itself stem the Republicans' decline in California.Schnur says they face other demographic challenges: "an electorate that is younger, an electorate that is more single, an electorate that is more urban.""Each of these constituencies have favored Democratic candidates in the past," he says.So much so that in California, "Republican" is now a toxic label, Sonenshein says."Some Republicans are now re-registering as independents to run for office — simply not to have the word 'Republican' next to their name," he says.Schnur believes the GOP will not allow this to a happen on a national level."If national Republicans begin to rethink their outreach to some of these voting communities, then maybe that drags California Republicans along with them as well," he says.Preventing California from once again being a national trendsetter.

In these last days before the presidential election, Fox News has redefined its role as the "voice of the opposition" by turning the network into an extension of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign. A Media Matters review found that Fox's coverage of Romney campaign speeches in the past three days has neared a whopping hour and a half of total airtime.By contrast, Fox's total coverage of President Obama's campaign speeches over the past three days lasted about 18 minutes, meaning the network has given Romney about 366 percent more airtime the week before the election to spread his message. Put simply, for every minute of airtime Obama received, Romney was afforded a little over four and a half minutes. In all, Fox's coverage of Romney speeches totaled an hour and 24 minutes.MSNBC and CNN were both more balanced in their coverage. MSNBC gave Obama about 49 minutes in contrast to Romney's 42, while CNN provided Obama with 53 minutes as opposed to Romney's 42.*On Saturday, Fox News kicked off its coverage with Romney's campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at 9 a.m. and cut away when he ended his remarks about 14 minutes later. It later aired his campaign speech in Dubuque, Iowa, for five minutes starting at 1:33 p.m.Meanwhile, Fox News did not air Obama's first speech of the day in Mentor, Ohio, around noon, and only gave his rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a passing mention at 4:31 p.m. In fact, Fox aired Obama's remarks for just 13 seconds before cutting away.MSNBC covered Romney's speech in Dubuque for four minutes, and aired five minutes of Obama's comments in Mentor and two minutes of his Milwaukee remarks. CNN aired four minutes of Romney's Portsmouth comments and a minute of his speech in Dubuque. It also aired three minutes of Obama's remarks in Mentor and six minutes of his speech in Milwaukee.Fox News' Friday coverage was almost as lopsided: Romney received 37 minutes of coverage for his campaign speeches, while Obama was afforded just 12 minutes.Indeed, Fox aired Romney's entire 26-minute speech in West Allis, Wisconsin, live on Friday, but aired only three minutes of Obama's speech in Hilliard, Ohio.Thursday's Fox coverage also followed this unbalanced trend: The network aired an entire 24-minute Romney speech live in Roanoke, Virginia, but cut away from Obama's remarks in Green Bay, Wisconsin, after just six minutes. Fox later aired five minutes of Romney's remarks in Doswell, Virginia, but did not cover any other Obama campaign stops.UPDATE: In the 24 hours that followed, the disparity in Fox's coverage of the two candidates widened even further. Between 5 p.m. Saturday and 5 p.m. Sunday, Fox aired 84 minutes of Romney's speeches live, compared with nine minutes of airtime for Obama's speeches. Since Thursday, Fox has aired two hours and 48 minutes of Romney's speeches, as compared with 27 minutes of Obama's speeches.On Saturday evening and during the day on Sunday, MSNBC aired 30 minutes of speeches from Obama and two minutes of speeches from Romney. CNN aired 13 minutes of Obama's speeches and 11 minutes of Romney's speeches.*These totals reflect coverage up to 5 p.m. ET on November 4.Correction: This post originally stated that Fox News gave Romney 80 percent more airtime than Obama, when in fact the truer figure is closer to 366 percent. Media Matters regrets the error.

Breaking up the big banks is a Wall Street reform that Elizabeth Warren may work to implement if she's elected to the U.S. Senate Tuesday."They have been lobbying the regulators to try to weaken the rules, to put loopholes in them, to try to delay them and try to get rid of them outright," Warren said on a call with volunteers Sunday, according to the Raw Story. "If they [regulations] are not strong enough, then I think we need to take another look at Glass-Steagall, separating the commercial banking activities from the investment activities."Warren, who has emerged as a voice of the public against big finance, is trying to unseat Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) in a competitive race. Warren is slightly ahead of Brown, according to recent polls. Money has poured into the Warren campaign from across the country, and the two campaigns have spent a total of $68 million as of mid-October.Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, dreamed up and helped implement the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has been in place for more than a year after the Dodd-Frank Act paved the way for the agency. It has been busy battling bank practices that hurt consumers, responding to specific consumer complaints, and sounding the alarm about growing private student loan debt.She also headed the congressional committee that oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the U.S. bank bailout program, between 2008 and 2010. In that role, she pressed for answers as to why the government gave away money to banks without forcing them to make leadership changes or swallow losses. She also demanded answers about how much TARP truly cost taxpayers.Warren said last year on MSNBC that TARP took away the cost of risk-taking for big banks: "We said, in effect, at the top, there's really not any pain in return for taxpayer support. Not so much so when it comes to folks at the bottom."Though it may come as no surprise that Warren, a consumer advocate, has called for breaking up the big banks, her opinion is shared by other more conservative critics such as Neil Barofsky, TARP's former special inspector general, former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill, and Frost Bank chairman emeritus Tom Frost.CORRECTION: A previous version of this post mistakenly said that Neil Barofsky succeeded Elizabeth Warren as head of the TARP oversight panel. Barofsky and Warren had distinct, concurrent roles as TARP's special inspector general and head of the oversight panel, respectively.

Among all registered voters, Obama leads Romney 51-42 percent, according to Pew.Obama and Romney are essentially tied among white Catholics, which some pollsters call the ultimate swing group.On Monday (Sept. 24) Romney unveiled his Catholics for Romney Coalition, which includes numerous politicians, beer magnate Pete Coors and Princeton University intellectual Robert P. George. The Obama campaign also has a Catholic coalition.From June 21-July 4, the U.S. Catholic bishops held a “Fortnight for Freedom,” with Masses, prayer groups and presentations in dozens of dioceses nationwide. The campaign was directed in part against an Obama administration mandate that requires some religious institutions, such as colleges and hospitals, to provide cost-free contraception coverage to employees.John C. Green, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio, said Obama’s surge among Catholic voters does not mean the bishops’ campaign was ineffective. But religious freedom is not the most salient issue for Catholics during an election dominated by economic concerns, he said.“It’s not the issue that most middle-of-the-road Catholics are responding to,” Green said.In mid-August, Romney named Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin and lifelong Catholic, as his vice-presidential nominee. While many conservative Catholics cheered the move, Romney received no “Catholic bounce” from selecting Ryan, according to the Pew poll. Obama’s vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, is also Catholic.Liberal Catholics, including some nuns, have chastised Ryan for using his Catholic faith to defend his GOP budget plan, which lowers taxes on the wealthy while cutting programs for the poor.Among white evangelicals, another crucial religious constituency, Romney’s support has inched up since July, from 69 to 74 percent, according to the Pew poll, while Obama’s percentage declined.Despite concerns that Obama’s support for same-sex marriage would alienate African-American Protestants, 95 percent still back Obama over Romney.Obama also leads among Americans with no religious affiliation, 65-27 percent. Romney leads among Americans who attend worship services at least weekly, 51-42 percent.The margin of error for the September survey of Catholic voters is plus or minus 5.1 percentage points, according to Pew.Copyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.

Jon Stewart opened his show tonight by ripping into Mitt Romney (for possibly the last time) over his claim that President Obama beat him because he offered gifts to people. Stewart mocked Romney by pulling out a literal giant gift bag filled with weed, contraceptives, and a piñata full of green cards. But Stewart saved his sharpest jabs for Bill O’Reilly over his implication that Obama’s reelection represents the end of traditional America.RELATED: Bill O’Reilly Decries ‘Secular Progressives’ Who Are ‘Bent On Destroying Traditional America’Stewart highlighted how much O’Reilly has bemoaned the end of traditional America, which apparently is a stake in the heart of “Leave it to Beaver” or something. When O’Reilly got around to the issue of whites now in the minority, Stewart pointed out that demographics in the United States are always changing, and there’s nothing you can really do about it.Stewart got a little personal with O’Reilly, pointing out the United States’ history of bigotry against the Irish. As Stewart pointed out, newspapers that referred to the Irish as horrible people were at least progressive in the sense that they accepted the Irish were people.Stewart also relaxed O’Reilly’s fears about American’s new religious outline and the “impact of creeping secularism” affecting Catholic support for Obama. As Stewart pointed out, Catholics were marginalized for decades in the U.S., and considering that a former president once sent the army into Utah to fight the Mormons, it’s pretty remarkable we almost had a Mormon president.Stewart offered O’Reilly some soothing words of advice, telling him not to worry so much, because “America’s greatest tradition” is a “frightened ruling class lamenting the rise of a new ethnically and religiously diverse new class,” and every generation rises in the United States in order to give themselves and their children the opportunity to “shit on the next group” to show up.Watch the video below, courtesy of Comedy Central:

From CBS News in March 2012, as part of an article where Mark Knoller breathlessly tells us how fast President Obama is adding more to the deficit than his predecessors, we get this graph showing where the deficit currently stands:But the total deficit and how fast it is rising under President Obama is only part of the discussion.  From Ezra Klein, in January 2012, we get the following two graphs showing the how both President George W. Bush and President Obama affect the deficit numbers:Looking at the two graphs, one can see that Bush added $5.1 trillion over 8 years and President Obama is only projected to add $983 billion over an 8 year period.  Even the Wall Street Journal has confirmed that President Obama has actually lowered the growth of the spending rate:In case you're wondering, The Wall Street Journal piece also had this graph showing the rate of spending growth back to President Reagan:This might leave you scratching your head about the increase of the deficit.  Where is the increase coming from?  As can be seen in this chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the largest part of the increase comes from revenue losses caused by the Bush tax cuts and the economic downturn:If you watched the Republican convention you might have seen the debt clock prop they introduced as a major theme.  (link)   Or if you read the recent piece by Matt Taibbi, you might have learned that Mitt Romney is, rather hypocritically, emphasizing the debt as a way criticizing President Obama.  Here is a Romney quote:Under President George W. Bush, Republicans in congress voted for tax cuts, two wars and a huge Medicare Prescription drug benefit, all unfunded.  Under this Democratic President, Republicans have suddenly found Jesus when it comes to deficit spending.  You can go here and click on the button that says "Burden of Debt' to hear Paul Ryan, who was one of the Republicans who voted for the tax cuts and the wars and the prescription drug benefit, opine on the subject.  Or you can watch Ryan rail against the borrow and spend approach here:There are those who believe this is all political posturing:Few are better than Senator Bernie Sanders at exposing the hypocrisy behind the sudden interest in the deficit:Let's start by playing a little game of "Guess the speaker." Who is the person quoted below making the case for deficit spending that will lead to later revenue surpluses?Joe Biden? No.  Barack Obama?  No.  Harry Reid?  No.  Nancy Pelosi?  No.  Chuck Schumer?  No.  Some Blue Dog Democrat maybe, sneaking in the word bipartisan to make the bipartisan fetishists in the DC cocktail circuit happy?  No.  Give up?  OK, it's Paul Ryan.  Yes that Paul Ryan.The 2002 Ryan makes a lot more sense than the current pseudo-deficit hawk version.  Besides not balancing the budget until 2050, Ryan's budget would shift lots of costs to states and localities, making the cuts to state and local services.  Here is a graph from CBPP (click on the provided link for more explanation of how this would impact state and local services) showing how much worse than sequestration the Ryan Budget would be :The real world solution to this is to ignore the lies of the lead Republicans when it comes to dealing with the deficit and elect a Democratic Congress that will not lead us over a cliff when it comes to Budget negotiations.  We face three scenarios.  According to the CBO, we can have the fiscal cliff Republican version:There is a second version that involves getting Republicans to cooperate.  There is little or no chance of that happening.  Or we can have the better non-fiscal cliff version that involves having a Democratic Congress: If you really want to fix the deficit, elect a Democratic Congress!!!Thanks for the rescue!

Sean Hannity was predictably agog over Donald Trump’s latest birther stunt – offering $5 million to the charity of President Obama’s choice if he releases his college transcripts, application and passport application. And just like he did in the Trump’s last birther lap, Hannity pretended Trump was raising legitimate, un-birther questions that President Obama should answer in the name of transparency. Then Hannity and Guilfoyle used Obama's expected failure to respond as yet another reason to attack him. For this alone, Hannity and Guilfoyle should be fired and thrown off the air for good. But we know they won't be.With a malicious smile, Hannity said, “I suggest, Mr. President, take $5 million and you could redistribute the wealth with Donald Trump’s money.”Kimberly Guilfoyle giggled along. But that’s not so surprising considering that the last time we saw liberal-before-Fox Guilfoyle, she was slobbering over Trayvon Martin-shooter George Zimmerman and Hannity’s dubious interview with him.The only thing more sickening than this disgusting display of birtherism was Hannity's I'm-just-curious pretense. Just like Trump's I'm-just-curious pretense. Hannity said, oh, so innocently, "All he’s (Trump's) saying – his college transcripts, applications, passport records and applications - $5 million for charity for kids. I’m like, why would anyone be against that? Why would the president just dismiss that?”Guilfoyle, grinning from ear to ear, offered up her own I'm-just-curious baloney. She said,  “Only if you’re a mean-spirited person that doesn’t want to be charitable. In fact, it looks like he DOES NOT.” Sneaking a peek at the camera, she sneered, “Everyone knows. God, he loves other people’s money and spending it, doesn’t he?“Surprisingly, it was Glenn Beck lite, Eric Bolling, who pooh-poohed Trump’s stunt. Bolling said, “Donald would be better served talking about some of the things that are really going on in the economy.” Bolling went on an extended discourse about how Obama is ruining the economy to the eager-eared Hannity.But Hannity was not to be dissuaded from talking up the birther. “I think we can walk and chew gum,” he said by way of reintroducing the subject. With more feigned guilelessness, Hannity added, “There’s a challenge here that this president said he’d be transparent (Guilfoyle murmured her agreement off camera). And yet he’s so reluctant to let us see a little, a little glimpse into his past. And I think there’s a reason. Why would you reject $5 million for charity when all he has to do is say to somebody that works for him, ‘Get my college records. Get my passport records. Here, Mr. Trump, give me the $5 million. Here are my charities.”Guilfoyle added, “If he wanted us to see them, he would have let them out before. Instead, they’ve spent a tremendous amount of money to hide and to conceal.”Well, speaking of avoiding a challenge for charity, today is Day 1283, or 3 years, 6 months, 4 days since Hannity offeredto be waterboarded for charity. Keith Olbermann upped the ante by offering $1,000 to charity for every second Hannity tolerates the process. Hannity’s offer and Olbermann’s challenge are the second video below.Considering that Hannity called waterboarding “dunking,” that should add up to quite a hefty sum for Hannity’s charity of choice, eh? What’s he hiding?You can contact Hannity via Twitter at @SeanHannity and Guilfoyle @KimGuilfoyle.

There’s been much schadenfreude on the left in the days after Tuesday’s election, and understandably so: Fox News, right-wing politicians, and conservative pundits all took an embarrassing beating.Perhaps the biggest recipient of that schadenfreude is Karl Rove. Rove has had a rough week, to put it mildly. After his infamous meltdown on Fox News Tuesday night – at one point in the evening Fox anchor Megyn Kelly asked him if his calculations were “math you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better” – things have just continued to go downhill. Here’s how.1. Researchers find that Rove’s super PAC was one of the election’s biggest losers.Researchers at the watchdog group the Sunlight Foundation found that Rove’s American Crossroads super PAC came in second to last, ahead of only the NRA, in terms of how much “bang for their buck” they got in this election. The American Prospect explains:[T]he biggest money-waster of all, you will be eternally gratified to hear, was Karl Rove's American Crossroads super PAC, which forked out a whopping $104 million and had a “desired result” rate of 1.29 percent. That’s right, folks: The great genius of American Republicanism wasted more of his donors’ money than anyone else. (His non-profit group, Crossroads GPS, did marginally better—a 14-percent “desired result” rate.) Looked at one way, though, American Crossroads had a kind of perfect score: The super PAC supported  zero candidates who won on Tuesday.At the other end of the scale is Planned Parenthood, which had a more than 97 percent success rate with its two political funds.2. He gets chewed out by wealthy GOP donors.The Huffington Post reports that rich donors are none too pleased with Rove:"The billionaire donors I hear are livid," one Republican operative told The Huffington Post. "There is some holy hell to pay. Karl Rove has a lot of explaining to do … I don't know how you tell your donors that we spent $390 million and got nothing."3. Even the ridiculous Donald Trump makes him look foolishThough not quite factually accurate, this tweet from Donald Trump is a good example of the rich dude rage directed at Rove:Supposedly Rove held a call with donors yesterday. That must’ve be interesting.4. He shows how much he’s living in fantasy land by saying Obama “suppressed the vote.”Rove’s election night Fox News performance revealed exactly how much of a liar he is. Yet he continues to try and pass off obvious BS as reality. Case in point: his claim earlier this week that Obama, whose campaign led a large, successful get out the vote campaign, won the election by “suppressing the vote.” The LA Timesputs his remarks in context:Appearing on Fox News, where he enthusiastically contested the network’s call of Ohio in favor of Obama earlier in the week, Rove said that Obama had “succeeded by suppressing the vote,” particularly by denigrating “Romney’s character, business acumen, experience.”Rove’s remarks come after a recent outcry from voices on the left that Republicans were attempting to suppress the vote though voter ID initiatives in vital states such as Pennsylvania and Florida.5. The devastating op-eds keep rolling in.Headlines like these keep showing up everywhere:Karl Rove Is The Most Overrated Person In Politics Today (CBS Boston)

In 32 states and Washington, D.C., voters are eligible to cast their ballot early with no excuse for doing so. For people whose jobs, child-care obligations, or other commitments make it difficult or impossible to reach the polls on Election Day, the opportunity to vote early extends the franchise. Spreading out voting over more days makes lines at the polls shorter, benefiting citizens. It also makes the election less vulnerable to unexpected events, like bad weather, broken voting machines, or terrorist attacks, that could conceivably disrupt things on a single Tuesday. Finally, states that permit voting on Sundays make it easier for churchgoers to participate in "Souls to the Polls" events, where congregations exercise their franchise together after services, walking or carpooling together to their polling place. So why not expand early voting?In 2008, high voter demand suggested more hours open, more polling places, and more poll workers were needed. Instead, Republicans in several contested states have fought to restrict early voting, sometimes successfully. (Did I mention that "Souls to the Polls" mostly happens in black churches?) Let's quickly survey the results of their recent efforts: These are hardly the only examples, but you get the idea.In Florida and Ohio, state officials arranged things such that citizens had to stand in line for hours to cast their ballot. Asked to extend early voting so that casting a ballot might be a bit less burdensome, they refused. It's an outrage. What's the worst that could've happened, a bit of overtime pay for election workers so that more Americans eligible to vote could do so? I don't always agree with everything Rachel Maddow says, but on this subject she is absolutely right:Josh Marshall It's not clear to me that it will affect the final outcome in the presidential race. But let's note that the dogged efforts of Republican governors in a number of key states to dramatically limit early voting is starting to pay dividends. This is qualitatively different from the standard voter suppression efforts Republicans have focused on. No state has to have early voting. Here in New York, supposedly one of the progressive states in the country, there's none. But the intent of curtailing early voting systems that were already in place is clear: limit the amount of people who end up voting. Particularly, limit the number of Democrats who vote since Democrats are disproportionately the people who take advantage of early voting.Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted Says Josh Marshall There are a lot of words to describe what Scott, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted , and various Republican state legislators and activists have done with regard to early voting: undemocratic, wrongheaded, cynical .... I shy away from un-American not because it is too harsh, but because the United States has an ugly tradition of partisans adopting measures knowing that they'll depress the ability of voters "on the other side" to be counted on Election Day. When found out, those people deservedly wind up as villains in the history books.These men's legacies are so tarnished. Unless and until they reverse course, let it haunt them in every future election where they compete, grate daily on their consciences, expose them to the rebuke of friends and family members, and be written into early paragraphs of their obituaries.

The safety net is the glory of America and the unending nightmare of Wall Street. That's why Wall Street’s leading “false flag” group, the Third Way (which calls itself a "leading moderate think tank"), has responded to the warnings that Robert Kuttner, AFL-CIO President Trumka, and I have made that if President Obama is re-elected our immediate task will be to prevent the Great Betrayal – the adoption of self-destructive austerity programs and the opening wedge of the effort to unravel the safety net (including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid).Here's what you need to know about this plan to rob Americans of their future.1. Both Democrats and Republican Oppose Cuts to the Safety NetsHuge majorities of Americans oppose cuts in the safety nets: A majority of Republicans oppose such cuts and Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the cuts. The American people love the safety net because they know it is essential to a humane America.  They know that it has transformed the nation.  Before Social Security, older Americans were frequently reduced to poverty and dangerously inadequate health care that made the remainder of their lives dangerous and miserable. The safety net does not cover only the elderly and the sick.  My father, for example, died when I (the eldest of three children) was 19 and a sophomore at the University of Michigan.  Even though in-state tuition was inexpensive in those days, I would have had to drop out of school.  Survivors’ benefits allowed me to obtain a superb education and pay back the nation with service and decades of greater taxes because education increased my income.  Food stamps and unemployment insurance frequently provide the temporary support that prevent tragedy and allow Americans to obtain useful education and jobs.  The safety net has made America a nation we are proud of and a nation that makes it possible for Americans to recover from hard times and tragedy and to lead lives that are vastly more productive and enjoyable.2. Only a Democrat Can Make it Politcally Safe for GOP Pols to Unravel the NetOne of the most important reasons that more Americans support the Democratic Party than the Republican Party is that the Democratic Party is viewed as the Party that created and guards the safety net.  The elements of the safety net are the crown jewels of Democratic Party policy successes.Only a Democrat can make it politically safe for Republicans who hate the safety net to unravel it (a process that would occur over a number of years) by legitimizing the claim that the safety net must be cut.  Obama may not intend to unravel the safety net. He may have been convinced by Wall Street that it is necessary to begin to unravel the safety net in order to save it.  But the result would be to declare open season on the safety net by legitimizing the false Republican memes that the safety net is unsustainable and harms the nation.  The Republican Party’s and Wall Street’s greatest frustration is that they have been unable to unravel or discredit the safety net. The Democratic Party has its Wall Street wing, but the Republican Party has been Wall Street’s principal representative for decades. The Republican Party has been unable to deliver Wall Street’s unholy grail – privatizing Social Security.Wall Street salivates at the prospect of any privatization of social security.  This would lead to them being able to charge tens of billions of dollars in fees annually. The banks that administered the privatized program would be Too Big to Fail, or what I call "systemically dangerous institutions" (SDIs) because the consequences of allowing bank failures to cause tens of millions of Americans to lose their retirement savings would require either that all such deposits be federally insured or that the failing banks be bailed out by the federal government. Privatization, therefore, is a convenient fiction. The banks’ profits will be private; any catastrophic losses will be borne by the public.  The SDIs’ that already enjoy massive political power, often exerted through front groups like "Third Way,” will burgeon.

Tuesday's elections produced some big winners -- and some really big losers -- whose names never appeared on any ballot.  After outside groups spent more than $1.3 billion in independent expenditures to influence the outcome of the election, we now get to see just what all that money bought them -- or didn't.Turns out some of the smart money wasn't so smart after all when it came to making political bets. This year, the pro-business GOP Crossroads fundraising combine and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce weren't as good at picking winners as the labor movement, which appears to be one of the surprise winners of Election Day.Using Follow the Unlimited Money, Sunlight calculated returns on investment for the outside groups that gave the most during this year's general election campaign. This includes super PACs, non-profit organizations and political party committees. We left out the big committees focused solely on helping presidential contenders -- Restore Our Future, which backed Mitt Romney, and Priorities USA, which supported President Barack Obama -- because their won/loss percentage will be obvious from the election results. The groups listed below all played in more than one contest.The percentage under each group's name represents their fall batting average: It reflects how much of their money went to support candidates who won and to oppose candidates who lost in the general election campaign. Our calculation does not include money spent on primary contests or special elections. And our data is only as good as the group's reporting to the Federal Election Commission. If you see discrepancies or errors, email us here.Click on the "full profile" links to see the full list of candidates supported by each group. One other caveat: We have calculated our "ROI" committee by committee: Some groups, such as AFSCME, made donations through more than one committee. The list below is a sampling of the highest-dollar donors. You can find a full chart of every outside spender and their returns on investment here.Our calculations reflect races that have been called by the Associated Press; we will continue updating this data as more contests become final.

Last April, Bishop Daniel Jenky, a Catholic bishop from Illinois, delivered a homily claiming that President Obama “now seems intent on following a similar path” to Adolf Hitler because of his “radical, pro abortion and extreme secularist agenda.” On Wednesday, he came within a hair of ordering every priest under his supervision to campaign for Mitt Romney.In a letter, Jenky told the priests in his diocese “[b]y virtue of your vow of obedience to me as your Bishop, I require that this letter be personally read by each celebrating priest at each Weekend Mass, November 3/4.” The letter leaves little doubt that Jenky wants Obama out of the White House:Neither the president of the United States nor the current majority of the Federal Senate have been willing to even consider the Catholic community’s grave objections to those HHS mandates that would require all Catholic institutions, exempting only our church buildings, to fund abortion, sterilization, and artificial contraception. . . . Nearly two thousand years ago, after our Savior had been bound, beaten, scourged, mocked, and crowned with thorns, a pagan Roman Procurator displayed Jesus to a hostile crowd by sarcastically declaring: Behold your King. The mob roared back: We have no king but Caesar. Today, Catholic politicians, bureaucrats, and their electoral supporters who callously enable the destruction of innocent human life in the womb also thereby reject Jesus as their Lord. They are objectively guilty of grave sin. For those who hope for salvation, no political loyalty can ever take precedence over loyalty to the Lord Jesus Christ and to his Gospel of Life. God is not mocked, and as the Bible clearly teaches, after this passing instant of life on earth, God’s great mercy in time will give way to God’s perfect judgment in eternity. I therefore call upon every practicing Catholic in this Diocese to vote. Be faithful to Christ and to your Catholic Faith.Earlier this year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops proclaimed that the federal budget must place “[t]he needs of those who are hungry and homeless, without work or in poverty” first — adding that the Republican budget authored by vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan “fails to meet these moral criteria.” Pope Benedict XVI, for his part, called for more robust government involvement to combat wealth inequality. Yet Jenky seems completely unmoved by these prongs of Catholic doctrine.Jenky’s opposition to birth control all puts him wildly out of step with his flock. 82 percent of Catholics say birth control is “morally acceptable,” and 54 percent of Catholics believe religiously affiliated organizations should be required to offer health plans to their employees that include contraception coverage.

BOCA RATON, Fla. -- President Barack Obama's "horses and bayonets" zinger, shooting down Mitt Romney's concerns about the state of the Navy, may have drawn reproach from Republicans, who called it "petty" and "belittling." But at least one former Navy secretary told The Huffington Post after Monday night's foreign policy debate that Obama was right on the mark."I thought the president's line was terrific," said Richard Danzig, who served as secretary of the Navy for two years under President Bill Clinton. "You don't measure efficacy by the number of ships. You measure it by your firepower, by the character of your people, the character of your equipment."During the Boca Raton debate, Romney repeated his campaign call to build new ships for the Navy and accused Obama of allowing the number of ships to drop to its lowest point since 1917."I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works," Obama replied. "Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater -- nuclear submarines."After the debate, Romney aides and surrogates decried the line as unbecoming of the president and a sign of Obama's "desperation.""I think the president belittled the military," said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). "He compared the modern Navy to bayonets and horses -- I thought that was an amazing statement.""Romney looked like a commander in chief," added Dan Senor, a top Romney foreign policy adviser. "President Obama looked like a frustrated politician who knew he was losing momentum. He looked angry."But Danzig, who was himself in Boca Raton as a campaign surrogate for the president, said that he wishes Obama had said more, namely that Romney's claim was also incorrect."The basic point that didn't get mentioned, that I would add, is the number of ships actually went down during the years of George W. Bush and have gone up in the Obama years," Danzig said. "So the notion that Republicans are more effective in building the Navy is not a correct one.""The Navy is stronger than it's ever been," he added.The independent fact-checking site Politifact has ranked Romney's claim that the Navy is the smallest it's been since 1917 as a "pants on fire" falsehood.

see more posts by Jason EasleyWhile the right has been blaming unions for the closing of Hostess, Newt Gingrich and George Will admitted that they expect the company to return without union workers in a right to work state.RADDATZ: Can we have — can we a very quick thoughts of Twinkies in your life? Just — not you, Jon Karl. You’re too young. You’re the youngest member of this roundtable. Did you like Twinkies growing up?WILL: I liked Hostess cupcakes, but don’t despair. Someone’s going to buy — someone’s going to — the brand has value. Someone will buy it. RADDATZ: It’s not the… WILL: And they will go and manufacture it in a right-to-work state, where Hostess does not have to operate under 372 collective bargaining agreements. RADDATZ: OK. OK. Quickly, just Twinkie memories. BRAZILE: I remember when it was 25 cent a pack, when my grandmother — it was two for five cents. It’s $1.69. I would like the original Twinkie back. RADDATZ: Twinkies… KARL: But I just have to say very quickly, I mean, what about Wonder Bread? Wonder Bread’s going, too. RADDATZ: Yeah, that’s… KARL: And this is not just about Twinkies. RADDATZ: You brought that with you, because you like it so much. BECERRA: I’m a chocolate fiend. Hostess has a company in Sacramento where I was born and raised, saw it every — almost every day of the week. RADDATZ: Five seconds?GINGRICH: I’m with George. Twinkie will survive in a new corporate framework.All of the blame of unions by Hostess and the right wing media is a bunch of malarkey designed to further the conservative agenda of destroying organized labor. The reality is that by closing the company, the investment bankers that run Hostess can suck even more profit out of an already twice bankrupted company. The door is open for someone to buy the company, and relocate it to a right to work state.According toFortune, this is how Hostess emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, “Hostess was able to exit bankruptcy in 2009 for three reasons. The first was Ripplewood’s equity infusion of $130 million in return for control of the company (it currently owns about two-thirds of the equity). The second reason: substantial concessions by the two big unions. Annual labor cost savings to the company were about $110 million; thousands of union members lost their jobs. The third reason: Lenders agreed to stay in the game rather than drive Hostess into liquidation and take whatever pieces were left. The key lenders were Silver Point and Monarch. Both are hedge funds that specialize in investing in distressed companies — whether you call them saviors or vultures depends on whether you’re getting fed or getting eaten.”Hostess was a distressed company that was taken over by Bain style management that had one eye on closing the company the whole time. Hostess had already stopped contributing to employee pensions, was swimming in debt, and demanded that workers take an additional 27%-32% pay cut.The vulture capitalists don’t care that 18,500 people just lost their jobs. Like Mitt Romney, to the job killers running Hostess profit is king. The Hostess brand will resurface. It is likely to come back in a Southern red state with a labor force earning a bit above minimum wage and no benefits. The Twinkie will be back, but those 18,500 decently paying jobs with benefits will never return.

Mitt Romney’s son Tagg has been gathering some of his father’s richest friends into a private-equity fund called Solamere, writes Froma Harrop. It’s a clever instrument for pursuing government subsidies, contracts and tax breaks should Romney win.Have you been following the career of Mitt Romney’s boy Tagg? As his dad runs for president denouncing “crony capitalism” and “big government,” Tagg has been gathering some of Mitt’s richest friends into a private-equity fund called Solamere — a clever instrument for pursuing government subsidies, contracts and tax breaks should Romney win.You see, disclosure laws would make it hard for a President Romney to hide many conflicts of interest. But if the money guys are in Tagg’s Solamere, we don’t know what conflicts of interest the Romney contributors are profiting from. We may not even know the investors’ names.“The close relationship with Romney and this investment opportunity looks to me like people are investing to buy access,” Bob Edgar, head of Common Cause, told me. “People are (literally) speculating that Romney may become the next president of the United States. It doesn’t smell good.”Before Solamere, Tagg’s main claim to business fame was as a marketer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Now he’s playing financier. The interesting part is that whether Mitt wins or loses (and he and his wife have given Solamere $10 million), Tagg and Spence Zwick — his campaign’s finance chairman and a Solamere partner — make a pile.Here’s an example of the awful possibilities: One of Solamere’s founding partners is Marc Leder, whose Sun Capital owns the Scooter Store. (It was at a fundraiser in Leder’s Boca Raton, Fla., home that Romney dismissed 47 percent of Americans as wards of the government.)You can’t have missed those annoying Scooter Store ads. A senior citizen rolls around on her motorized wheelchair, proclaiming, “... and I didn’t pay a penny out of pocket for my power chair!” The message is that Medicare will pay. For a while, it did.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that 80 percent of the Scooter Store’s sales did not meet Medicare rules. In money terms, the Scooter Store had bilked taxpayers of nearly half a billion dollars.The Scooter Store has spent nearly $900,000 on lobbyists trying to stop Medicare from disqualifying its wares for taxpayer subsidies. Leder has also given a total of $525,000 to Romney’s campaign and a Republican PAC, and he’s letting Tagg enrich himself by managing his money in Solamere. Do you believe for one minute that Leder will want nothing back from a Romney administration?Fracking and other energy interests have put their money with Tagg. So have military contractors. Dental-management companies have been targeted for pressuring dentists to perform expensive work on low-income children, the bill sent to Medicaid. They’re in Solamere. So are the investor-owners of for-profit colleges, which Romney has praised from the stump. Known for providing weak education, the for-profit schools draw 85 percent of their revenues from taxpayers. Romney a small-government president? My foot.Solamere’s private-equity partners, meanwhile, would surely object to tax reform that messes with the outrageous deal that taxes their earnings at only 15 percent — the sort of loophole that served Romney well at Bain Capital. True to form, Solamere has set up shop in the Cayman Islands to shield its investors from U.S. tax liabilities.Let’s not play the innocent here. In every administration, Republican or Democrat, campaign contributors seek favors. What’s different is the awesome scope of the money involved and the unblushing sales pitch linking investments to an inside track that — via Solamere — would go under the radar.Last June, Solamere held an investor conference in a Salt Lake City building next door to a fundraising retreat for wealthy Romney donors. That Solamere touts its “unparalleled networks” so openly is the scariest part. Politicians used to do these things in secret.Providence Journal columnist Froma Harrop's column appears regularly on editorial pages of The Times. Her email address is fharrop@projo.com

This week, a number of Republican senators have strongly criticized the administration for failing to properly explain the circumstances surrounding the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi. Some of those senators failed to show up for a briefing on the attack Wednesday.Sen
