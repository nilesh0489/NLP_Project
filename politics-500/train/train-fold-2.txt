Two years since a conservative sweep of the State Board of Education, November’s election carries high stakes, with all 15 seats on the ballot and the instructional direction of 5 million Texas school children in the balance. The divide between two camps on the issues of history and science, political and religious ideology is deep. For one, the fight for control of the SBOE is nothing less than a cultural clash. The other views the November contests as critical choices to protect conservative values. The board determines curriculum standards and textbooks for the state’s K-12 public school system and also controls the $26 billion Permanent School Fund, which benefits public education. The next board will select new science and social studies/history textbooks to reflect updated science curriculum standards. “That’s where all these culture war battles will come to a head over what students learn about evolution, about civil rights, about church and state separation,” said Dan Quinn, spokesman for the Texas Freedom Network, an Austin-based group that monitors the SBOE from a more liberal perspective. “All those battles will come in 2013 and 2014, and the textbooks will be in the classrooms for a generation.” Will the new textbooks “teach science or pseudo science?” Quinn asks. “Will we have history textbooks that teach facts based on real scholars or opinions based on the political beliefs of whoever controls the board?”Remember that Texas textbook purchases are so large, they pretty much determine the content of texts used in schools across the nation.From 2010, after conservatives won the most seats in the last election:The conservative members maintain that they are trying to correct what they see as a liberal bias among the teachers who proposed the curriculum. To that end, they made dozens of minor changes aimed at calling into question, among other things, concepts like the separation of church and state and the secular nature of the American Revolution. “I reject the notion by the left of a constitutional separation of church and state,” said David Bradley, a conservative from Beaumont who works in real estate. “I have $1,000 for the charity of your choice if you can find it in the Constitution.” They also included a plank to ensure that students learn about “the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s, including Phyllis Schlafly, the Contract With America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association.” In economics, the revisions add Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek, two champions of free-market economic theory, among the usual list of economists to be studied, like Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes. They also replaced the word “capitalism” throughout their texts with the “free-enterprise system.” “Let’s face it, capitalism does have a negative connotation,” said one conservative member, Terri Leo. “You know, ‘capitalist pig!’ ” In the field of sociology, another conservative member, Barbara Cargill, won passage of an amendment requiring the teaching of “the importance of personal responsibility for life choices” in a section on teenage suicide, dating violence, sexuality, drug use and eating disorders.

[…] Cynthia Dunbar, a lawyer from Richmond who is a strict constitutionalist and thinks the nation was founded on Christian beliefs, managed to cut Thomas Jefferson from a list of figures whose writings inspired revolutions in the late 18th century and 19th century, replacing him with St. Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin and William Blackstone. (Jefferson is not well liked among conservatives on the board because he coined the term “separation between church and state.”)

Puerto Ricans faced a fundamental question on Election Day: Should they change their ties with the United States?Citizens in the U.S. island territory cannot vote in the U.S. presidential election, but many were excited to participate in a referendum on whether to push the territory toward statehood, greater autonomy or independence.Car horns blared and party flags waved after polling stations closed following what election officials said was a high voter turnout. During the day, many voters carried umbrellas against the blistering tropical sun as temperatures neared 90 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius).The two-part referendum first asked voters if they wanted to change Puerto Rico's 114-year relationship with the United States. A second question gave voters three alternatives if they wanted a change: become a U.S. state, gain independence, or have a "sovereign free association," a designation that would give more autonomy for the territory of 4 million people.With 243 of 1,643 precincts reporting late Tuesday, 75,188 voters, or 53 percent, said they did not want to continue under the current political status. Forty-seven percent, or 67,304 voters, supported the status quo.On the second question, 65 percent favored statehood, followed by 31 percent for sovereign free association and 4 percent for independence."Puerto Rico has to be a state. There is no other option," said 25-year-old Jerome Lefebre, who picked up his grandfather before driving to the polls. "We're doing OK, but we could do better. We would receive more benefits, a lot more financial help."But 42-year-old Ramon Lopez de Azua said he favored the current system, which grants U.S. citizenship but prevents Puerto Ricans from voting for president unless they live in the United States, and gives those on the island only limited representation in Congress."Puerto Rico's problem is not its political status," he said. "I think that the United States is the best country in the world, but I am Puerto Rican first."Both President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney said they supported the referendum, with Obama pledging to respect the will of the people if there was a clear majority. Any change would require approval by the U.S. Congress.Puerto Rico held non-binding referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998, with statehood never garnering a clear majority and independence never obtaining more than 5 percent of the vote.The island also was electing legislators and a governor, with Gov. Luis Fortuno of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party seeking a second term. Fortuno, a Republican, was challenged by Alejandro Garcia Padilla, whose Popular Democratic Party favors the status quo. With 817 of 1,643 precincts reporting late Tuesday, Garcia had 427,604 votes, or 48 percent, while Fortuno had 422,506 votes, or 47 percent.---Associated Press writer Ben Fox contributed to this report.

Americans are prepared to blame Congressional Republicans any failure to avert the fiscal cliff, according to a poll on Tuesday.While 51 percent of Americans don’t expect a deal, Democrats have substantially more faith than Republicans in the ability of President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans to compromise, according to the Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll. Two-thirds of Republicans aren’t anticipating a deal, and only a quarter expect one. But a plurality of Democrats — 47 percent to 40 percent — expect Obama and the GOP to reach an agreement.Congressional Republicans are likely to face the blame for any impact: 53 percent of Americans said the GOP would be at fault, compared with 29 percent who said the same of the president. Ten percent said both would be to blame. The gap is even bigger among independent voters, only 23 percent of whom would blame the president.The fiscal cliff would amount to a giant removal of cash from the economy. On Jan. 1, 2013, The Bush-era tax cuts would expire, along with a payroll tax cut introduced by the 2009 stimulus bill. At the same time, spending cuts agreed to in August 2011 as part of the debt-limit deal would slash almost $1.2 trillion in defense and domestic spending over the next decade. The CBO projects unemployment could raise to 9.1 percent if the country plunges over the cliff.While 68 percent of Americans think it will have a major impact on the American economy, a significantly smaller number — 44 percent — expect it to have a major impact on their own personal financial situation. Sixty-two percent expect the impact on the economy to be mostly negative, while 20 percent think the impact will be positive.The poll of 1,000 Americans was conducted from Nov. 8-11 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

The following is a guest post in the form of an open letter from Special Olympics athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens to Ann Coulter after this tweet during last night’s Presidential debate.Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren’t dumb and you aren’t shallow.  So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult?I’m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public’s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow.  I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you.  In fact it has taken me all day to figure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night.I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have.Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next.Finally, I wondered if you meant to degrade him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift.Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are – and much, much more.After I saw your tweet, I realized you just wanted to belittle the President by linking him to people like me.  You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV.I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash.Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor.No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much.Come join us someday at Special Olympics.  See if you can walk away with your heart unchanged.EDITOR’S NOTE: John has previously written powerful opinion pieces on the R-word. Read one here.

Volunteers with True the Vote, a Tea Party group that claims it is trying to fight voter fraud by challenging the right of voters to vote, may have committed fraud themselves. Plunderbund, an Ohio-based political blog, reported Monday that members of the group attempted to sign up as poll observers in African American-heavy precincts in central Ohio, but may have forged signatures to do so.While local candidates officials had authorized members of the group to serve as designated observers on forms filed in October, five of the six Franklin County candidates had withdrawn permission to use their signatures prior to the submission of this week’s forms. According to one candidate, the True the Vote volunteers simply “forged” her name onto the document — possibly a 5th degree felony.According to the report:The forms have been rejected unanimously by all members (Rs and Ds) on the board. True the Vote observers will not be allowed in Franklin County polling locations tomorrow. Poll monitoring organizations expect they may still be stationed outside of polling locations. Board member Zachary Manifold told us he was ”amazed that a group that goes to such extreme lengths to claim voting fraud in Ohio would knowingly forge or misuse signatures to try to gain access to Franklin County polling locations.”The U.S. Department of Justice is monitoring Franklin County — home to Columbus, Ohio — to enforce federal voting rights laws and “protect the rights of all citizens to access the ballot on Election Day.”Numerous studies have shown in-person voter fraud is virtually non-existent in the United States. But attempts to suppress the vote by intimidation and challenges to legitimate voters by groups like True the Vote are a serious threat to what President Ronald Reagan called “the crown jewel of American liberties” — the right to vote.

UPDATE 3:03 p.m. King and Pierce County prosecutors are dismissing more than 220 misdemeanor marijuana cases in response to Tuesday’s vote to decriminalize small amounts of pot.In King County, 175 cases are being dismissed involving people 21 and older and possession of one ounce or less. I-502 makes one ounce of marijuana legal on Dec. 6, but King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg decided to apply I-502 retroactively.“Although the effective date of I-502 is not until December 6, there is no point in continuing to seek criminal penalties for conduct that will be legal next month,” Satterberg said in a statement.The dismissed cases involved arrests in unincorporated King County, as well as the state highways and the University of Washington. About 40 of the cases had already been filed in court as criminal charges; those charges will be dismissed. Another 135 cases were pending charging decisions and will simply be returned to the arresting police agency.Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said he was dismissing “about four dozen” pending cases where misdemeanor marijuana was the only offense. He said his staff was continuing to prosecute other cases where possession was secondary to a more serious charge, such as drunken driving.“The people have spoken through this initiative,” said Lindquist. “And as a practical matter, I don’t think you could sell a simple marijuana case to a jury after this initiative passed.”In an interview, Satterberg said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession above one ounce, allowing for “a buffer for those whose scales are less than accurate.” His office also charges felony possession — for people with more than 40 grams — although he said his staff routinely allows those defendants to plead down to a misdemeanor.“I think when the people voted to change the policy, they weren’t focused on when the effective date of the new policy would be. They spoke loudly and clearly that we should not treat small amounts of marijuana as an offense,” he said. I-502 campaign manager Alison Holcomb said she was “incredibly moved” by Satterberg’s announcement, which she said showed “incredible courage.”The decision supports a prime argument I-502 made during the campaign. A study by a group of academics found there had been 241,000 misdemeanor marijuana possession cases in Washington over the past 25 years, 67,000 of them in the past five years. “If 502 hadn’t passed, we’d see the same amount of marijuana possession cases every year,” she said. “What makes a difference is changing the law.” Satterberg is the first prosecutor to change charging policy after I-502, but other prosecutors are also considering these cases. Tom McBride of the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys said his office “just starting to work through those issues.”Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes has refused to prosecute misdemeanor possession cases since he took office.Earlier this week, the chief criminal deputy prosecutor in Spokane County, Jack Driscoll, appeared to take a more conservative position. He told the Spokesman-Review that, even after Dec. 6, the only marijuana which was legal to possess was pot sold in the state-licensed stores called for in I-502. Those stores won’t be created for at least a year.“The only thing that is legal is selling marijuana through those stores,” Driscoll said. “That will be regulated by the state. You can’t under this initiative have an ounce of marijuana that doesn’t come from a state-issued provider. You still can’t have black-market marijuana.”Holcomb disputed that interpretation. So did Satterberg, who called it a “very narrow reading” of the initiative. “I don’t know how you trace where (the marijuana) comes from,” he said. Satterberg said he expected federal authorities to seek an injunction to block implementation of I-502?s state licensing scheme for marijuana retailers and growers. “I think it’s the kind of issue the U.S. Supreme Court will have a final word on,” said Satterberg, calling it an “an important state’s rights issue.” But he does not expect a federal lawsuit to target the types of cases he is dismissing, noting that states already have widely divergent penalties for marijuana possession.

Note: Welcome, Reddit readers! You've been redirected here from BlueOregon.com. The popularity of this story is overwhelming our site. This is an important story and we want you to be able to read it. Thanks for coming by!Late this afternoon, Clackamas County identified the suspect in the felony ballot-tampering investigation as Deanna Swenson of Oregon City, a 55-year-old registered Republican. Clackamas County has fired her.When WW reporters came to her home Monday afternoon, Swenson wasn?t in a mood to talk. WW asked her how many ballots were involved, and Swenson replied tearfully, ?Only the two.? Swenson declined to answer other questions. She said she has not yet hired an attorney to represent her.Whether her claim that it was just two ballots is unknown:According to the Oregonian's Yuxing Zheng, she is not a full-time county employee, but rather a temporary employee who has worked during elections since 2010. By contrast, according to Willamette Week's Nigel Jaquiss, she's worked "in various elections since 2000."As a guy who does a lot of social media work in politics, my first move is to the voterfile and to Facebook. Here's what I've learned:There is only one Deanna Swenson registered to vote in Oregon City. She's a very regular voter with a conservative score described to me by one field organizer as "through the roof". She's got either a hunting or a fishing license. She returned her ballot this year in-person at Clackamas County Elections on October 31st - the day the ballot-tampering incident occurred. This is her Facebook page. On October 27th at 12:25 a.m., she clicked LIKE on the Republican National Committee. On October 12th, The Tea Party. On October 8th, Paul Ryan VP (the official Paul Ryan page.) And there are many, many more just like that. With exactly one exception (Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, ironically), her political fan profile is exclusively hard-core right-wing stuff - and very nearly half of everything she's LIKE'd is political. The rest is hunting-related, shopping-related, or generic stuff like "music" and "photography". (I've posted the complete list below.)Of course, the spin coming out of the County Clerk's office right now is that this was a one-time incident and it was contained to just two ballots. But here's what I want to know:Why was a right-wing activist hired as a vote-counter in the elections office? Everybody's entitled to their opinions, but ballot-processing isn't a job for activists. (I wouldn't hire me to be an election worker, either.) Who hired Deanna Swenson? And based on what qualifications? What was the screening process used to ensure that the vote-counting process wasn't being polluted with political activists? And why did Swenson feel comfortable enough in that room to start filling in bubbles on a ballot? In an environment that is, presumably, all about protecting the integrity of the process, how and why would someone feel that they could whip out a pencil and start marking ballots with impunity? Who else has been doing election work in Clackamas County? And are they also right-wing activists? Update: One more -- Other than her activities on Facebook, has Swenson been involved as an activist with any right-wing organizations locally or nationally?If this was a one-time freak incident that was caught immediately, then that's a wonderful thing. But that seems too tidy. We need a comprehensive investigation that goes back a decade or more to understand what's been happening. There have been way too many razor-thin elections in Clackamas County to be sanguine about all this.Here's the full fan profile for Deanna Swenson. She's a fan of just 90 pages, but 39 of them are political - and all but one of those are right-wing activist pages:

Mitt Romney has an amazing ability to make a profit on anything. He can make millions when a company goes bankrupt, reap huge returns off the 9/11 tragedies and profit from getting high schoolers hooked on tobacco. But his greatest trick off all was raking in millions from the auto rescue he opposed.In a stunning exposé published Thursday in the The Nation– with support from The Investigative Fund — reporter Greg Palast reveals how key donors to Romney’s campaign made more than a billion dollars off the restructuring of General Motors by holding a key player in the supply chain hostage to their demands during the heart of America’s worst jobs crisis in 50 years.Delphi Automotive is an auto parts maker that used to be part of General Motors and remains essential for auto production. Without Delphi, there would be no American automotive industry. And unfortunately for America, it ended up being controlled by Elliott Management.Elliott Management is run by ?Paul Singer, a massive Republican donor and “defender of the 1 percent.” Ann Romney’s so-called blind trust invested at least a million dollars in Elliott before the fund began buying Delphi at vulture prices—about 20 cents on the dollar—during the worst of the Great Recession. When the hedge fund managers were told that they should save as many American jobs as they should, they refused and forced a judge to hold an auction for the company’s stock. Elliott eventually took over the entire company for 67 cents a share.Two years later Delphi shares were selling at $22 each, an astounding profit even for Mitt Romney.How did Delphi undergo such a remarkable turnaround? They took federal bailout funds, slashed worker pensions, fired union workers and sent American jobs overseas.Greg Palast explains, “The bottom line: the hedge funds’ paydays were made possible by a generous donation of $12.9 billion from US taxpayers.”We have no idea how much the Romneys made from the auto bailout, but knowing that he was the only national figure who opposed the rescue, saying that it would destroy the industry, it’s safe to say that even one cent would be too much.

In an effort to ensure new voter-approved amendments that legalize limited use of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington are not overrun by the federal government, Democratic U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette introduced bipartisan legislation Friday that aims to curtail such a scenario."My constituents have spoken and I don't want the federal government denying money to Colorado or taking other punitive steps that would undermine the will of our citizens," DeGette, of Denver, said in a statement.The legislation, coined "Respect States' and Citizens' Rights Act," comes on the heels of Colorado voters approving Amendment 64, which legalizes up to an ounce of marijuana for anyone over the age of 21.The bill seeks to exempt states where voters have legalized pot from the federal Controlled Substances Act provision on marijuana.Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman of Aurora, a staunch opponent of Amendment 64, supports the bill."I strongly oppose the legalization of marijuana, but I also have an obligation to respect the will of the voters given the passage of this initiative, and so I feel obligated to support this legislation," Coffman said.DeGette said in a statement that after the Nov. 6 election, lawmakers expressed concern about the federal government's ability to override these voter-approved initiatives and the states' rights to exercise the will of their citizens.The legislation comes on the same day a handful of members from the state's Congressional delegation were part of a coalition of lawmakers who sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder , urging him to respect the new voter-approved marijuana laws in Colorado and Washington.In the letter — penned by U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, D-Boulder — DeGette and U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Golden, said they believed it would be a mistake for the federal government to "focus enforcement action on individuals whose actions are in compliance with state law."Lawmakers write in the letter to Holder that they are concerned that the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration will continue to "threaten individuals and businesses" acting within the scope of their states' laws on medicinal use of marijuana.The letter charges that the DEA has contradicted assurances from Holder's office in 2009 that it would not prioritize criminal charges against individuals who act in compliance with state law, and that they hope a similar outcome will not occur with the new laws that saw "overwhelming public support."In Colorado Amendment 64 passed with 55 percent of voter support.Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, held a conference call with Holderlast week to gauge how the federal government will respond to Colorado's legalization of marijuana.On Thursday, Denver prosecutors said they will no longer charge those 21 and older for carrying less than an ounce of marijuana, and will review current cases that fit under the language of a Amendment 64. Earlier in the week Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett made headlines when he announced his office will dismiss any pending cases that deal with less than an ounce of marijuana.Several counties all across Colorado are weighing their options in how to move forward in the wake of Amendment 64's passage.

see more posts by Sarah JonesRachel Maddow believes Mitt Romney isn’t fit to be president. While talking about his lies and shifting policies she said, ‘It’s a character issue, and I find it disqualifying.’Here is the video:Maddow said was talking about Romney’s complete reversal of his policy on the war when she said,That political calculation makes so much sense to me, if there were not 68,000 American lives on the line. And that’s what infuriates me, because this is a real war. This is not changing your mind on light rail. This is changing your mind and denying your previous positions that are on the record about the fate, the lives and deaths, of 68,000 Americans, and asserting that not only is it okay for you to change your mind, I believe in people changing their mind, but that you can get away with running from the things that you have previously claimed were your heartfelt beliefs, and now denying that you ever believed they were true. It’s a character issue, and I find it disqualifying.I am certain that anyone on the right or left who cares about facts and honesty probably agrees with Maddow, but facts and honesty aren’t the media world that we are living in. The issue isn’t that Mitt Romney lies with impunity. The problem is that few people in the mainstream media are actually challenging the lies.However, President Obama would likely be better served not to spend the final two weeks on the campaign trail chasing those ghosts. If Obama spends his last days on the stump fact checking Romney, he will lose control of the story that he is trying to tell to voters about the choice between the two paths the country can travel down for the next four years.In another era Mitt Romney would not have survived the primary process, much less became a major party nominee. It speaks volumes about the health and condition of the Republican Party that a candidate who would have been weeded out during the primary process became the nominee. But it really doesn’t matter who the Republicans would have nominated, the party would have rallied around him because they hate Obama that much.Mitt Romney’s lying and political shape shifting should disqualify him from office, but it won’t. The Romney campaign knows that most voters are too uninformed to know that he is lying, and the media is too worried about being “neutral” to care. Mitt Romney’s lack of character was on full display during the debate as he gleefully toyed with the fates of 68,000 Americans who are serving their country, which is something that Romney himself never had the character and courage to do.Romney’s shape shifting should be a disqualifying issue, but it has become a strength. If Romney can find enough low information voters to exploit, he could be elected president.The prospect of a Romney presidency isn’t just infuriating; it is illness inducing.

For the chairman and chief executive of Murray Energy, an Ohio-based coal company, the reelection of President Obama was no cause for celebration. It was a time for prayer — and layoffs.Robert E. Murray read a prayer to a group of company staff members on the day after the election, lamenting the direction of the country and asking: “Lord, please forgive me and anyone with me in Murray Energy Corp. for the decisions that we are now forced to make to preserve the very existence of any of the enterprises that you have helped us build.”On Wednesday, Murray also laid off 54 people at American Coal, one of his subsidiary companies, and 102 at Utah American Energy, blaming a “war on coal” by the Obama administration. Although that charge was repeatedly leveled during the election, energy analysts say that the coal-mining business is suffering because of competition from low-cost natural gas and rising production costs of coal, especially in the Appalachian region.Murray Energy is the country’s largest privatelyowned coal mining company, with about 3,000 employees producing about 30 million tons of bituminous coal a year, according to its Web site.The company was the subject of an article in the New Republicthat said the firm forced miners to attend a Romney campaign speech in southeastern Ohio in August. Murray denied the account. The New Republic also reported that Murray Energy employees have given more than $1.4 million to Republican candidates for federal office since 2007.Murray has been a target of environmentalists. Notably, the company has spilled coal slurry into a creekonseven occasions.Murray’s prayer from Wednesday first appeared on the Web site of the Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register. The newspaper said Murray supplied his text. The Washington Post confirmed its legitimacy with a company spokesman, Gary M. Broadbent.Here is the full text of the prayer:The American people have made their choice. They have decided that America must change its course, away from the principals of our Founders. And, away from the idea of individual freedom and individual responsibility. Away from capitalism, economic responsibility, and personal acceptance.We are a Country in favor of redistribution, national weakness and reduced standard of living and lower and lower levels of personal freedom.My regret, Lord, is that our young people, including those in my own family, never will know what America was like or might have been. They will pay the price in their reduced standard of living and, most especially, reduced freedom.The takers outvoted the producers. In response to this, I have turned to my Bible and in II Peter, Chapter 1, verses 4-9 it says, ‘To faith we are to add goodness; to goodness, knowledge; to knowledge, self control; to self control, perseverance; to perseverance, godliness; to godliness, kindness; to brotherly kindness, love.’Lord, please forgive me and anyone with me in Murray Energy Corp. for the decisions that we are now forced to make to preserve the very existence of any of the enterprises that you have helped us build. We ask for your guidance in this drastic time with the drastic decisions that will be made to have any hope of our survival as an American business enterprise.More from The Washington Post:The Fact Checker: Would a tax hike on the wealthy kill 700,000 jobs?GOP begins review to find out what went wrongWonkblog: If the U.S. goes over the fiscal cliff, do we still need to raise the debt ceiling?

As a candidate, Mitt Romney was his own worst enemy. He thought he could amass a majority saying things that would please the crowd in front of him and contradict himself with another crowd somewhere down the line without anyone taking notice. He thought he could offer vague platitudes about his programs and no one would push him for details. He thought he could tell wild fibs about his opponent and no one would check the facts. In the end, he merely fooled himself.As comedians Bill Maher, Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart gleefully point out with regularity, Republican candidates, campaign gurus and the conservative pundits who tout their causes have developed a habit of making up comforting memes disconnected with facts. They may see this as a way to shift reality -- if you say something often enough, some people will, indeed, come to believe it -- but, ultimately, if you play make-believe too much, sooner or later it catches up with you.It caught up with the GOP on election night. As the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, said: “You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.”In the final weeks of the election, Karl Rove and the conservative crew at Fox News had convinced themselves that the polls were lying about President Obama’s small but solid lead. They convinced themselves that there was an enthusiasm gap on the Democratic side and that young people, especially, would fail to vote. They apparently thought the Obama campaign’s claim to have developed the best ground game in the history of presidential politics was a bluff, just like all their own bluffs. And they could not imagine that Obama could rack up wins in nearly all of the swing states.Of course, conservatives were not alone in their failure to perceive what was going on. Most of the mainstream news media was also mired in conventional wisdom about enthusiasm gaps and battlegrounds up for grabs.Here is what the facts turned out to be:• Romney predominated only among older white men; Obama won 55% of women, 93% of African Americans, 71% of Latinos and 60% of voters ages 18 to 29.• Rather than there being an enthusiasm gap, Obama pretty much replicated his winning 2008 coalition.• The Obama campaign gurus in Chicago were not lying; they had the money, time and energy to get all their voters to the polls. • The “enthusiasm” of the tea party and the religious right proved to be a detriment to the Republican cause. Their wacky candidates, including Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Todd Akin in Missouri, were disasters and their demand for ideological purity turned the GOP primaries into a clown show and their eventual nominee into a pandering hypocrite. • The Republicans’ silly scare stories about voter fraud were used to justify restrictions on voting that black Americans, in particular, perceived as a threat to their hard-won right to vote. As a result, those folks were willing to stand in long lines for hour after hour in states such as Ohio and Florida so that their voices could be heard. And what they said was “four more years for Barack Obama.”Democrats do not have the only good ideas or all the brains in American politics, but in 2012, they had a far better grasp of reality.

AMERICAN elections are watched closely in Mexico, which sends most of its exports and about a tenth of its citizens north of the border. But Tuesday’s presidential contest is not the only poll that’s sparking interest south of the Rio Grande. On the same day, voters in Colorado, Oregon and Washington will vote on whether to legalise marijuana—not just for medical use, but for fun and profit. Polls suggest that the initiatives have a decent chance of passing in Washington and Colorado (Oregon is a longer shot).The impact on Mexico could be profound. Between 40% and 70% of American pot is reckoned to be grown in Mexico. According to a recent study (in Spanish) by the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), a think-tank in Mexico City, the American marijuana business brings in about $2 billion a year to Mexico’s drug traffickers. That makes it almost as important to their business as the cocaine trade, which is worth about $2.4 billion.In Mexico relatively few people take drugs. But many are murdered as a result of the export business. About 60,000 have been killed by organised crime during the past six years. Thousands more have disappeared. Many Mexicans therefore wonder if America might consider a new approach. Felipe Calderon, the president, has said that if Americans cannot bring themselves to stop buying drugs, they ought to consider “market alternatives”, by which he means legalisation. Vicente Fox and Ernesto Zedillo, the two previous presidents of Mexico, have reached the same conclusion.What would happen if Colorado, Oregon or Washington were to vote for such a “market alternative” on Tuesday? None of those states is a very big drug market in itself. But if it were legal to grow pot in, say, Washington, it’s not hard to imagine that a certain amount of it would illegally leak out into neighbouring states. Would Mexico’s bandits find themselves undercut by “El Cártel de Seattle”?IMCO reckons they could be. It calculates that the cost of growing marijuana legally is about $880 per kilo. Adding on a decent mark-up, plus the taxes that would be applied, it puts the wholesale price of Washington marijuana at just over $2,000 per kilo. The cost of illegally transporting the drug adds about $500 per kilo for every thousand kilometres that the drug is hauled, it calculates, based on the fact that pot gets pricier the further you get from the Mexican border. So smuggling legal Washington dope to New York, for instance, would add about $1,900 to the cost of a kilo, giving a total wholesale price not much below $4,000.That would make it more expensive than imported Mexican pot. But home-grown marijuana is much better quality than the Mexican sort. The content of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the part that gives you the giggles, is between 10% and 18%, whereas in Mexican pot it is only about 4% to 6%. Once you adjust for quality, Washington pot would be about half the price of the Mexican stuff, even after it had made its expensive illegal journey to New York. IMCO reckons that home-grown marijuana from Colorado, Oregon or Washington would be cheaper than the Mexican stuff virtually everywhere in the country, with the exception of a few border states where the Mexican variety would still come in a bit cheaper.As a result, it estimates that Mexico’s traffickers would lose about $1.4 billion of their $2 billion revenues from marijuana. The effect on some groups would be severe: the Sinaloa “cartel” would lose up to half its total income, IMCO reckons. Exports of other drugs, from cocaine to methamphetamine, would become less competitive, as the traffickers’ fixed costs (from torturing rivals to bribing American and Mexican border officials) would remain unchanged, even as marijuana revenues fell.Legalisation could, in short, deal a blow to Mexico’s traffickers of a magnitude that no current policy has got close to achieving. The stoned and sober alike should bear that in mind when they cast their votes on Tuesday.

Both events were pulled off with calculated cynicism.Yesterday, Romney's campaign – facing the challenge of a president in command of natural disaster relief – converted an Ohio political rally into a political rally disguised as providing voluntary charitable contributions to help hurricane victims on the East Coast.  The problem was that collecting canned goods and other items is not what agencies such as the Red Cross want.  In fact, attempting to process such relatively small donations hinders massive assistance efforts, according to non-governmental organizations.Loading donated cans of Campbell's Soup and jars of peanuts into a rental truck makes for a nice photo-op, but it won't help any hurricane victims.  Nine will get you ten that the donations will be dropped off at some pantry in Ohio, far away from the damage from Sandy.On top of that, BuzzFeed reports that allegedly $5,000 was spent at Walmart by the Romney campaign so that Mitt could be photographed amidst an abundant supply of granola bars and diapers.This last-minute "relief effort," of course, is consistent with the Romney/Ryan belief that individual charitable contributions can somehow take care of areas with billions of dollars in damage.  Did anyone bring a house, bridge or subway to the Romney "compassion" charade? Doubt it, wouldn't fit in the rental truck.Romney's notion of non-governmental resolution of natural disasters is as fecklessly quaint as his "horses and bayonets" notion of our military needs.  Since Romney refuses to repeat his promise to dismantle FEMA since Hurricane Sandy struck, he can only offer a feeble photo showing him accepting a six pack of Gatorade.  It was so Disneyesque!The Ohio stunt provides a one-two punch of opportunistic displays of ambition disguised as compassion. Just last week Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, practically broke into a soup kitchen in Youngstown in order to get a photo of him washing pans with his wife.  But don't think the Ayn Rand acolyte was going soft. It was all for show.  According to US News and World Report:Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan’s visit Saturday to an Ohio food kitchen was no more than a staged photo op, fumes the charity’s president.Ryan barged into the Youngstown dining hall long after guests had been served and left, grabbed an apron and scrubbed down a few measly dishes while TV cameras and photographers snapped away, said Brian J. Antal, president of the Mahoning County St. Vincent De Paul Society, the charity that runs the soup kitchen."Had I been on site, he would not have been allowed in," Antal told the Daily News on Tuesday.Natural disasters present crises that pull the nation together, which is counter to the GOP presidential campaign notion of every man and woman for him or herself.Just as Romney's charge that Obama is responsible for a non-existent movement of 1500 Jeep manufacturing jobs to China is as fake as a three dollar bill, so is his con of acting compassionate.

“A note on republican bullshit on the deficit” elicited some negative responses from my republican friends. After reading the responses, it became clear to me that one needs to call out the Republican bullshit on capitalism as well. These guys are so enamored with this catchword that they fail to look at the implementation.Now that I think back, the biggest piece of crap to go unchallenged prior to the last election is this perceived ‘opposition to capitalism’ from democrats. It is rather unfortunate that being a democrat is immediately equated with one being a socialist, anti-capitalist and supportive of a nanny state.We must set the record straight as nothing can be further away from truth. Democrats are not anti-business. What democrats oppose is the republican model of capitalism. Let us take two examples:Romney’s plan for saving auto industry was touted as a working model that does not use deficit financing.It is rather obvious that people touting this as the ultimate solution do not understand the concept of velocity of money. They do not understand how such an action would have certainly lead to a deflationary cycle that would have been impossible to break.Since this concept has been properly discussed in my earlier post, I am not going to repeat here. What I want to do instead is to highlight one particular piece of this proposal that will illustrate how ‘Republican Capitalism’ works.The key sentence is “The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing”What this means is if the plan fails then government is on the hook. However, if the plan succeeds then investors get the prize.This is exactly the ‘Heads I win, Tail you lose’ capitalism that democrats do not like. I am quite sure that after bringing this to your attention you would feel the same.A different example would be of Robert Murray, the chief executive of coal provider “Murray Energy”. This guy claimed that if President Obama were re-elected then the conditions for his business would deteriorate because of more regulation and taxes, and weaker economic activity.The key to correctly interpreting the above claim is “more regulation and taxes.”What this means is Mr. Murray has this nice, well-settled business that has been running for a long time. For him it does not matter that our planet will certainly turn into a wasteland if we keep on burning coal. What is more important to him is his profit. One would have thought that such a successful entrepreneur would have the vision to get into industries of the future; I guess he just got lucky in life.This is another example of the “Republican Capitalism” that the democrats do not agree with. Yes, we want more regulation on coal industry. Yes, we need to declare war on coal. Does this make us anti-capitalist? Bullshit!

President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner have each made cursory appeals to cooperation in the wake of Tuesday’s election. But they’re still making incompatible demands about the tax code. And on Friday, President Obama made clear that if Republicans reject the policy goal he campaigned on, all of the Bush tax cuts will expire.“If we’re serious about reducing the deficit we have to combine spending cuts with revenue, and that means asking the wealthy to pay a little more in taxes,” Obama said in public remarks at the White House. “Right now if Congress fails to come to an agreement on an overall deficit reduction package by the end of the year, everybody’s taxes will automatically go up on January 1.”In both 2008 and 2012, Obama campaigned on the goal of allowing the Bush tax cuts that exclusively benefit top earners to expire. That would increase the top marginal tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent next year. But Boehner and other Republicans want tax rates off the table and GOP aides suggest higher tax rates can’t pass the Republican House.In his first post-election press conference, a couple of hours before the President’s statement, Boehner also indicated his willingness to compromise — though he reiterated Republican opposition to raising tax rates. “On Wednesday, I outlined a responsible path forward to avert the fiscal cliff without raising tax rates,” Boehner said.“There is no mandate for raising tax rates on the American people,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said in a Wednesday statement. “There is a mandate for avoiding the fiscal cliff and finding real solutions so we can make life work for people again.”Obama did leave modest room for negotiations. “I’m not going to ask students and seniors and middle class families to pay down the entire deficit while people like me making over $250,000 aren’t asked to pay a dime more in taxes,” he said.Boehner could meet Obama’s demand without raising tax rates by limiting tax expenditure benefits for high income people. But for now, Boehner has only suggested that revenues from this sort of base broadening should be used to lower tax rates. Obama, by contrast, is asking the House to pass a Senate bill that would isolate the Bush tax cuts for top earners and allow them to expire.“The Senate has already passed a bill doing exactly this, so all we need is action from the House,” Obama said. “And I’ve got the pen, ready to sign the bill right away.”In an official statement, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, echoed the President. “The Senate passed a bill to cut taxes for Americans making less than $250,000, and the House should pass it immediately.”White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was even more blunt. “He will veto any bill extending Bush era tax cuts for the top two percent of wage earners in this country.”That leaves the onus on Boehner to either pass that bill, or find an equivalent way to take the same amount of new revenue from high income earners. So far, he and other GOP leaders seem unwilling.“”The increased tax rates that would be allowed under the Senate-passed bill are part of the fiscal cliff that economists are warning us to avoid,” Boehner said in response to the Presidents remarks. “Those increased tax rates will destroy jobs in America by hurting small businesses across the country.”Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was more strident. “[T]here is no consensus on raising tax rates, which would undermine the jobs and growth we all believe are important to our economy,” McConnell said. “While I appreciate and share the President’s desire to put the election behind us, the fact is we still have yet to hear an actual plan from the President for addressing the great economic challenges we face. What’s needed now is a realistic and specific proposal from the President that can actually pass the Congress.”They’ve left themselves some wiggle room. But if they don’t squeeze themselves through it, Obama said, everyone’s taxes go up at the end of the year.

Do not give your ballot to the Republicans. Mail it yourself, they urge.They write, “It’s been reported that King County GOP is offering to collect and return voters’ ballots.We recommend that voters return ballots to an official King County Elections ballot drop-off location or through the US Postal Service. Voters may use the online ballot tracker to confirm that King County has received their ballot.”(Click image above to see warning.)County elections spokeswoman Kim van Ekstrom told theSlog they were alerted to the activity via “a call to our phone bank, and we want voters to know we are aware of this activity.” Indeed.In Oregon, a Republican Clackamas County elections worker is under criminal investigation for tampering with ballots. She was reportedly filling in a straight Republican ticker for voters who left it blank. That is, of course, a class C felony.She shouldn’t feel too badly though, because Republican voter registration strategist Nathal Sproul’s worker in Virginia is facing 8 felonies for election fraud for tossing your voter registrations away.Republicans were right to warn us about voter fraud, because it finally brought attention to the much larger and more systemic problems of election and voter registration fraud.The lesson here is do not give your ballot to that ‘nice’ Republican. Mail it yourself, lest it end up in the trash or filled in for a straight Republican ticket against your wishes and intentions.

The College Republicans, a student club at Fordham University, has invited Ann Coulter to speak on campus on November 29. The event is funded through student activity fees and is not open to the public nor the media. Student groups are allowed, and encouraged, to invite speakers who represent diverse, and sometimes unpopular, points of view, in keeping with the canons of academic freedom. Accordingly, the University will not block the College Republicans from hosting their speaker of choice on campus.To say that I am disappointed with the judgment and maturity of the College Republicans, however, would be a tremendous understatement. There are many people who can speak to the conservative point of view with integrity and conviction, but Ms. Coulter is not among them. Her rhetoric is often hateful and needlessly provocative—more heat than light—and her message is aimed squarely at the darker side of our nature.As members of a Jesuit institution, we are called upon to deal with one another with civility and compassion, not to sling mud and impugn the motives of those with whom we disagree or to engage in racial or social stereotyping. In the wake of several bias incidents last spring, I told the University community that I hold out great contempt for anyone who would intentionally inflict pain on another human being because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.“Disgust”was the word I used to sum up my feelings about those incidents. Hate speech, name-calling, and incivility are completely at odds with the Jesuit ideals that have always guided and animated Fordham.Still, to prohibit Ms. Coulter from speaking at Fordham would be to do greater violence to the academy, and to the Jesuit tradition of fearless and robust engagement. Preventing Ms. Coulter from speaking would counter one wrong with another. The old saw goes that the answer to bad speech is more speech. This is especially true at a university, and I fully expect our students, faculty, alumni, parents, and staff to voice their opposition, civilly and respectfully, and forcefully.The College Republicans have unwittingly provided Fordham with a test of its character: do we abandon our ideals in the face of repugnant speech and seek to stifle Ms. Coulter’s (and the student organizers’) opinions, or do we use her appearance as an opportunity to prove that our ideas are better and our faith in the academy—and one another—stronger? We have chosen the latter course, confident in our community, and in the power of decency and reason to overcome hatred and prejudice.

The following statement was issued by BCTGM International Union President Frank Hurt in response to the announcement by Hostess Brands that it would begin liquidation.“Hostess’s announcement that it is liquidating the company is a deep disappointment for all of our Hostess members. While Hostess management wants to blame our members for the demise of the company, the truth is that had it not been for the valiant efforts of our members over the last eight years, including accepting significant wage and benefit concessions after the first bankruptcy, this company would have gone out of business long ago.“Hostess failed because its six management teams over the last eight years were unable to make it a profitable, successful business enterprise. Despite a commitment from the company after the first bankruptcy that the resources derived from the workers’ concessions would be plowed back into the company, this never materialized. Management refused to invest in modernizing its bakeries or devote necessary resources to advertising and marketing, product development and new technology. Business plan after business plan failed, leaving the company ever deeper in debt.“When a highly-respected financial consultant, hired by Hostess, determined earlier this year that the company’s business plan to exit bankruptcy was guaranteed to fail because it left the company with unsustainable debt levels, our members knew that the massive wage and benefit concessions the company was demanding would go straight to Wall Street investors and not back into the company.“Our members were aware that while the company was descending into bankruptcy and demanding deep concessions, the top ten executives of the company were rewarding themselves with lavish compensation increases, with the then CEO receiving a 300 percent increase.“Our members decided they were not going to take any more abuse from a company they have given so much to for so many years. They decided that they were not going to agree to another round of outrageous wage and benefit cuts and give up their pension only to see yet another management team fail and Wall Street vulture capitalists and “restructuring specialists” walkaway with untold millions of dollars.“Throughout this long and difficult process, BCTGM members showed tremendous courage,solidarity and devotion to principle. They were well aware of the potential consequences of their actions but stood strong for dignity, justice and respect.”

see more posts by Sarah JonesJon Stewart summed up the GOP’s positions on rape, abortion, and conception, ‘If a woman wants to have a baby via IVF she can not. Rape? She has to.’Here is the video:After playing Mourdock’s God intended rape comments, Mourdock’s follow up press conference where he declared that his God abhors rape, and Joe Scarborough claiming that Mourdock is turning off swing state voters, Stewart said,No, that’s not the problem. That’s not the problem. The problem is the believing of the things, not that he. The problem isn’t that he violated the first law of Fetus Club, which is don’t talk about Fetus Club. Like that’s not, because it’s the ideas. I mean where does Mourdock get his crazy fringe ideas about rape and abortion anyway? Ah, I don’t know. Maybe from Mitt Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, who cosponsored a Sanctity of Human Life Act so severe that it not only could outlaw all abortions, but it could also effectively ban in vitro fertilization. Or from the platform of the Republican Party, which states that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life, and calls for a human life amendment to the constitution. Nothing in there about exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother, or feelings of swing voters. In other words, according to the Republican Party platform, and the man who wants to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, if a woman wants to have a baby, in vitro fertilization, she can not. Rape? She she has to. No wonder they buried it on page fourteen instead of splashing it across the cover.The Daily Show host summed the issue up in an understandable way that every American should hear. The Republican Party has gone so far to the extreme that their position is to force women to have their rapists’ babies, while they forbid women from conceiving in a modern, non-Bible approved way. The Republican rejection of IVF is also related to the fact that the GOP is under the control of the conservative anti-science fringe.Stewart was right on. The Republican Party doesn’t get it. The problem with the Akins and Mourdocks of their party isn’t that they turn off swing voters and lose elections. The problem is that they believe in things like “legitimate rape,” and rape being, “God’s intention.” These men are advocating a policy that glorifies the fruits of a heinous and violent crime against women.Republicans also seem to be under the delusion that this issue is a trivial distraction in this campaign. On The Ed Show, Republican strategist Ron Christie called issues of contraception and choice, “small ball.” There is nothing small ball about telling women what they can do with their bodies. There is nothing trivial about the idea that men like Tom Smith, Richard Mourdock, and Todd Akin will be coming in between a woman and her doctor. Would any American, male or female, want Akin and Mourdock acting in their capacity as federally elected officials making healthcare decisions for them?If the Republicans are successful in using the government to dictate what women can do with their bodies, who is to say that someday they won’t decide that cancer is God’s will, and it would help reduce the deficit if we let those people die as, “God intended.”Where would it stop?The Republican positions on rape and abortion are more than women’s issues.The issue is freedom, and destruction of personal liberties knows no gender.

WASHINGTON – The Justice Department said Wednesday that it has joined a lawsuit against The Gallup Organization alleging the polling company filed false claims on contracts with the U.S. Mint, the State Department and other government agencies.A fired Gallup employee who became a whistle-blower, Michael Lindley, alleges in the lawsuit that he discovered shortly after going to work for the polling company that it had engaged in widespread fraud against the government.Honored as "Rookie of the Year" at Gallup in 2009, Lindley says he was fired six months later when he told colleagues that if the company didn't report overbilling practices to the government, Lindley would do so himself.His lawsuit, filed nearly three years ago and unsealed Wednesday in federal court, says Gallup routinely submitted inflated cost estimates which enabled the company to reap huge profits from its government business.In addition to its polling work, Gallup provides consulting services to government, corporate and other clients around the world.The Justice Department said it was stepping into the case with respect to Gallup's contracts with the Mint and the State Department.In response, Gallup general counsel Steve O'Brien said, "We believe that the allegations and the legal theory that the Justice Department is using are entirely meritless."O'Brien said the work involved fixed-price contracts that were all competitively bid and paid for as agreed. Now, said O'Brien, the government is saying "the price should have been something else."O'Brien is among those named in Lindley's lawsuit. According to Lindley, when he asked O'Brien why he had been fired, O'Brien said "When you start talking about going to the Department of Justice, I don't trust you anymore."According to Lindley's lawsuit, on a $2 million-a-year sole-source contract with the Mint, Gallup inflated the number of hours required to complete the work, usually by a multiple of two or three times the number justified by historical experience. Gallup was hired to conduct market research for the sale of newly issued coins.The State Department work involved the U.S. Passport Agency. During negotiations on a $25 million sole-source contract, Gallup allegedly submitted detailed budgets with vastly inflated hours on the time to complete the work for the agency. Gallup was hired to conduct surveys to predict the level of passport applications stemming from changes in border laws governing travel to Mexico and Canada.Separately, Lindley alleges that Gallup exercised undue influence over the award process on a $15 million contract with the Army's Joint Contracting Command in Iraq.The lawsuit says Gallup actually wrote the request for proposal that the Army's contracting officer issued. Gallup wrote the proposal so the contract could be awarded only to a company with characteristics that were unique to Gallup, according to Lindley's allegations.In a $10 million contract with a Health and Human Services Department agency, Gallup allegedly shifted costs from some of its fixed-price government contracts to a cost-plus contract with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.In a $2 million-a-year contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a Gallup executive allegedly submitted inflated estimates of the hours required to complete various tasks, inflating the contract price.

The best argument for finally ridding ourselves of the Electoral College, besides that it is a regular reminder that our sainted Founding Fathers created an explicitly undemocratic and exclusionary form of government when they invented a system that no other country has been fool enough to imitate, is that it assigns far too weighty a responsibility to states that are completely incompetent and mostly run by horrible assholes.And so this particular miserable election has come down to essentially three states: Florida, Virginia and Ohio. But mostly Ohio. Ohio  is a depressing place already, as is much of the post-industrial Midwest, and this attention is not making them any happier. Florida is full of lunatics and run by criminals. Virginia might elect George Allen again. This is no way to run a country.Thanks to the Electoral College, and our bizarre system of assigning electoral votes, and our decentralized and easily demogogued system of determining who gets to vote, and when, and how, the minority of voters who show up to vote in midterms and off-year elections choose the men who control the ballots and the polling places, and  those men (and, once, Katherine Harris) do everything they can to ensure that people have a hard time of it.(It’s depressingly rare that presidential elections end up riding primarily on the results in states with pristine histories of clean and fair elections. Though I heard Romney’s “expanding the map” to Minnesota, so who knows.)At least this year the important states are rather large (if New Hampshire ends up being the deciding state I swear to god I’m moving to Switzerland) and reasonably diverse. But they’re not as large and diverse as the states that have been complete afterthoughts in presidential politics for a generation — New York, California, Texas — and the prominence of Ohio in particular fuels the gross Beltway press fetishism for the precious votes of Real America (white, rural or suburban America).A purely popular vote-based election, in which Obama actually tried to turn out supporters in Crown Heights and Berkeley while Romney barnstormed the old Confederacy for three months, would definitely horrify Washington mandarins devoted to the Great White Independent, but it might help battle the popular perception that winning with blacks, Hispanics and young people  doesn’t “count.” (It would also give slightly more power to minorities in “red” states and those oh-so-bitter conservatives in “blue” ones.) We already have a form of government that heavily favors rural areas and small states — the next senator from the state of Nebraska will effectively have veto power over all the priorities of every member of California’s entire congressional delegation — and yet we constantly wonder why Americans, especially young ones, are so apathetic about actually voting.So let’s abolish the Electoral College, please. Ohio will probably be grateful. (Then we can work on abolishing the Senate, expanding the House, instituting ranked or runoff voting nationwide, and establishing simple national suffrage.) (Seriously, will some idiot centrist billionaire throw money at those things, please.)

For weeks, protests and brief strikes by Walmart workers across the country yielded dismissive statements from Walmart about how small the number of protesters and strikers was in the context of the company's 1.4 million U.S. workers. But Friday, a week before a planned wave of Black Friday protests, it became clear that this isn't something Walmart is dismissing. The company filed an unfair labor practice charge against the United Food and Commercial Workers, the union that supports non-union Walmart worker groups .* That's not a tactic Walmart would bother with if it was confident it could crush these workers' spirits as it's accustomed to doing. You know what creates an uncomfortable environment and undue stress on people, including families with children? Walmart's ridiculously low pay scale and scanty opportunities for advancement, such that, according to internal company documents That, combined with policies intentionally keeping workers at part-time hours so they don't qualify for benefits, is why so many Walmart employees are forced to rely on food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet. Being kept poor is the sort of thing that causes families with children just a little more distress than being exposed to workers picketing outside of stores.Walmart's dismissive statements about the small percentage of workers taking part in the protests are accurate in a literal sense, but the decision to try to use the law to shut the protests down reveals that something bigger than the percentages is going on: this is the first time Walmart has faced such sustained, defiant activism against its abuses of workers. Usually when workers have tried to fight the conditions they face, retaliation and intimidation from managers have been enough to shut it down. That's not working this time, and as the protests spread and draw public notice, it seems that executives are nervous enough to go beyond their usual tactics. And when they're nervous, it's time to double down.* Edited to clarify that OUR Walmart is not a formal affiliate of, but is supported by, the UFCW.

We've witnessed many Mitt Romneys, but the one unearthed by the Boston Globe's Murray Waas yesterday is perhaps the most vicious and cruel: a zealot who, as Massachusetts governor, became hellbent on stigmatizing the children of gay and lesbian parents, labeling these kids as outcasts and causing them to suffer hardship throughout their lives.Waas reveals how, after gays and lesbians in Massachusetts won the right to marry in 2003, Governor Romney wouldn't allow the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics to revise birth certificate forms for babies born to same-sex couples. The plan was to have the box for "father," for example, relabeled "father or second parent." But according to documents obtained by Waas, Romney rejected the plan, demanding the agency continue using old forms. Romney then demanded hospitals get permission from his office each time a child was born to a same sex-couple in order to cross out, with a pen, the label "father" or "mother," and write-in, with a pen, "second parent." (Romney also required gay male parents to get a court order before any birth certificate was issued.)Those children would then go through life with birth certificates that marked them as strange, abnormal, less than everyone else, punished because Romney didn't approve of their parents. As a Department of Health attorney warned Romney, the children would be disadvantaged and would have trouble applying to school or getting drivers licenses as adults, particularly in a post-9/11 world where they might be considered security risks, having birth certificates that appeared altered. It was a "violation of existing statutes," the attorney warned Romney. But Romney waved off the warnings, not caring about the the legal, psychological or personal ramifications.Romney hadn't even previously fathomed that gay people had children. Boston Spirit magazine reported last month that when gay activists met with him in his office in 2004, as Romney was backing a failed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in the state, Romney remarked, "I didn't know you had families." Julie Goodridge, lead plaintiff in the landmark case that won marriage rights for gays and lesbians before the Supreme Judicial Court, asked what she should tell her 8-year-old daughter about why the governor would block the marriage of her parents. According to Goodridge, Romney responded,"I don't really care what you tell your adopted daughter. Why don't you just tell her the same thing you've been telling her the last eight years."Months after his battle with the Registry of Vital Records began, as Waas reportsin theGlobe, Romney spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington:The following year, 2005, Romney spoke to conservative voters in South Carolina, as he trained his eye on the presidency. "Some gays are actually having children born to them,'' he said. "It's not right on paper. It's not right in fact. Every child has a right to a mother and father.''Does it really matter whether his actions and statements were motivated by Romney's authoritarian Mormon faith or were a pander to evangelicals as he sought the presidency, or both? That he could be so zealous, cold-hearted and cruel should alarm everyone about the prospect of Mitt Romney becoming president.Also on The Huffington Post:

Both Donald Trump’s organization and Macy’s issued statements this week reaffirming that are unmoved by the nearly 600,000 people who have signed a petition asking the retail giant to drop its association with the reality star.“Macy’s marketing and merchandise offerings are not representative of any political position,” Macy’s spokesman Jim Sluzewski told BusinessWeek. “Many of the individuals associated with products sold at Macy’s—or at any retailer, for that matter—express personal opinions that are not related to the merchandise we sell or to the philosophies of our company.”Macy’s also rejects the interpretation of its hallmark Christmas ad that is clearly a reference to Trump’s birtherism.The response from Team Trump was, predictably, more pointed.“What I find incredulous is that the creator of the petition is protecting his First Amendment right to free speech while simultaneously trying to impede upon Mr. Trump’s,” Michael Cohen, executive vice president and special counsel to Trump, told Celebuzz. “It’s ironic.”Of course, the First Amendment prohibits the Congress from make any law prohibiting free expression. Nowhere in the Constitution is an individual protected from the consequences of expressing offensive opinions.Angelo Carusone, who started the petition, believes this movement is all about consequences.“Trump’s brand is consequence-free bullying,” he said. “That doesn’t reflect well on Macy’s. People expect more from Macy’s.”Macy’s CEO Terry Lundgren defended the partnership with Trump in an email to Carusone Wednesday, saying that they provide a broad array of products to provide customers with choices.“Please understand and appreciate that Macy’s marketing and merchandising offerings are not representative of any political position. Ours is a free society compromised of a wide range of viewpoints,” he wrote.Since the middle of 2011, Trump has been the country’s most famous “birther.” A week before the election he was still demanding the president release his passport records, implying that his citizenship is still an unsettled matter. In this accusation is the charge that the president is committing both fraud and treason. That’s some “personal opinion.”Some believe that the best way to punish Trump is to ignore him—this has resulted in his experiencing no consequences for his outbursts. Apparently he is so popular that Macy’s is willing to suffer any negative associations—even as it begins its crucial holiday shopping season and its Facebook page is being overrun with negative comments about the reality TV star.If there’s ever been someone who believes that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, it’s Donald Trump. And for now, it appears Macy’s agrees.

The Columbus Free Press is reporting that the Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted allegedly ordered for “experimental software patches” to be installed on vote-counting machines in a number of Ohio counties.According to the newspaper, voting rights activists are concerned that the software patches, which are usually used to update or change existing software, could potentially affect over 4 million registered voters, including those who live in Columbus and Cleveland.Ohio law allows for the experimental use of voting equipment as long as it’s restricted to a limited number of precincts, and under the experimental label, equipment can legally be used without certification.The Free Press revealed the contract between Husted’s office and the contracted vendor Election Systems and Solutions reads that the software has not been and does not need to be reviewed by any testing authority at the state or federal level.Election Counsel Brandi Laser Seske sent out a memo to Secretary of State personnel yesterday, detailing the software. In the memo, she explains the software did not require review because it is not “involved in the tabulation or casting of ballots … or a modification to a certified system.”Matt McClellan, a spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office, told theGrio that no patches were installed, describing instead a reporting tool software meant to “assist counties and to help them simplify the process by which they report the results to our system.”McClellan said the tool serves to cut down on the amount of information precinct workers would have to key in by hand by allowing the results to be output onto a thumbdrive and uploaded at once into the Secretary of State’s system.“It basically just creates a one-way flow of information — and that is simply from their system, out,” McClellan said. “So at no point in time are we going into their system and messing with anything.”When asked why the reporting tool was labeled experimental, McClellan responded, “It is a pilot project that we’re doing with about 25 counties or so. So it’s not statewide, but it is a pilot project we’re trying.”And when asked why a pilot project is being launched so soon before the election, he said, “I’m not sure the exact timeline of that, but I know we’ve been working with the counties for the past couple of months on getting these in place, testing them to make sure they work properly, and working with the vendors as well.”There are only days left until Election Day and the fear of voter suppression is only increasing. McClellan said there should be no concerns that the new reporting tool will jeopardize the voting results or voter information, but voting rights activists remain far from reassured.Civil rights organizations like the Advancement Project plan to be on the lookout for any voting rights violations in Columbus and Cincinnati, among other cities in the nation.

We want a country where not just the rich get richer. The class mobility in the US, historically our strong point, now far lags other countries. We want our children to have better opportunity.We want a country where religion isn't shoved down our throats, up our vaginas, or takes the place of science and evidence based reasoning. In particular we'd like congress' science committees staffed by people of the 20th century or at least post-enlightenment.We want a country that puts evidence before theory and both before ideologyWe want a country where we can afford to go to college. This was another US historic strong point (starting with the WW2 GI Bill)We want a country where being sick doesn't mean death or bankruptcy.We want a country that doesn't incarcerate a higher fraction if it's population than any other or tries to make a business out of it.We want truly equality under the law: women, minorities, poor, whatever.We want good jobs that allow us to retire and work without fear.We want a country where every politician isn't beholden to the corporate interests they now need (though the GOP couldn't even make that work)We want a country that uses war as an honest absolute last resort.We want a country that doesn't spend more than the next top 15 countries or so on defense while its infrastructure and education needs help.We want a country where the rich don't pay a lower effective tax rate than the middle class.We want clean water, clean air, safe food and drugs.We want Wall St/banks to be regulated so that we don't ever hear the words "too big to fail" and get whacked by more bubbles.We want to do away with the idea that money is speech and corporations are people.We want a country that understands that we are more than the sum of our parts. I know that people on the right will view this as socialism. I disagree, what the right is advocating is pretty much anarchy; a corporate dystopia. We want schools, infrastructure, etc and that takes money. We are part of physical communities. That's why we have taxes. To have nice things. To use the nice things, like the roads, and to not pay taxes doesn't make you a patriot; it makes you a deadbeat.We want elections that operate in the manner befitting a first world country that aren't subject to partisans.We want a politicians that put country over party at least to the point that they don't threaten, like a kid, to hold their breath until their face turns blue unless they get what they want...and a tad of civility and compromise wouldn't hurt

A pack of millionaires descended on Washington, DC, Wednesday to tell Congress to take more of their money. The Patriotic Millionaires for Fiscal Strength, a group formed in 2010 to push Obama to allow the Bush tax cuts on millionaires to expire, are back, and lobbying for the same thing as Congress faces the looming fiscal cliff.A dozen or so 1-percenters, representing the group's total membership of about 200, are meeting with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle this week to deliver the message that "we care as much about our country as we do about our money," and that any budget agreement Congress cobbles together in the coming weeks should include fat taxes on the rich.At a press conference to kick off the campaign Wednesday, Frank Patitucci, CEO of NuCompass Mobility, explained why the group is seemingly advocating against its own interests. "We believe we've been able to achieve our circumstance in life because of the vibrancy of the American system we live under," he said. "Right now we're in danger of losing some of what has been valuable to us." He noted that Americans like him often pay lower tax rates than, say a middle-income single mom with two kids. "We're losing the opportunity to achieve the American dream the way we have."Garrett Gruener, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur from Oakland, California, laid out the specifics of their demands: allow top tax rates to return to Clinton-era rates of 39.6 percent, and create a new tax bracket for those who make over $10 million; let taxes on capital gains return to Clinton-era levels of between 20 and 28 percent; tax dividends at the same rate as ordinary income; bring back a hefty estate tax; and limit itemized deductions for the wealthiest Americans.The millionaires are quick to point out that they are not just a bunch of bleeding-heart libs. They're a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and independents who see upping taxes on the rich as a practicality, not charity."I'm acting out of selfishness," said Woody Kaplan, a businessman from Boston (who incidentally voted for Gary Johnson for president). "With every business I've owned, customers have been terribly important. If we give the middle class a break, then we're much more likely to grow the middle class, and that will make all of us stronger."That sounds nice, but what about all that GOP grumbling that higher taxes on the rich will curb job creation? Balderdash, says Gruener. "Their theory is by reducing my tax rates, I'll do more to create jobs. It just isn't true. If I thought they were right about that I'd be on their side of this negotiation. But my own experience as a venture capitalist is that this sort of investment they're talking about, in fact, has nothing to do with marginal tax rates."T.J. Zlotnitsky, chairman and CEO of iControl Systems, agreed. "When it's time for my company to hire someone, I don't make a decision based on my personal tax rate. It's based on what my customers need. It's whether we see a new opportunity, a new concept."The Patriotic Millionaires are meeting with nine Dems and three Republican legislators over two days. When asked how exactly they planned to convince the GOP to include the millionaires' plan in a budget compromise, Zlotnitsky appeared almost offended by the idea that their proposal was partisan. "There's an assumption that everyone here is of one political persuasion," he said. "I don't think it's about that. I think it's about putting Americans first. Putting country ahead of our party. The message is that people who are fortunate in this country such as ourselves are prepared to do more for our country. Now it's up to [the GOP] to be patriotic as well."

Mitt Romney’s final attempt to swing Ohio polls in his direction is a bit too much for a number of political reporters, and is now facing an aggressive response from the Obama campaign.In news articles, tweets, and other media, members of the national press, usually reluctant to criticize campaigns directly, have taken Romney to task for running a misleading TV ad creating the false impression that Jeep will ship jobs to China because of President Obama’s auto rescue.“Mitt Romney’s campaign has released an ad in Ohio that says he — and not President Barack Obama — will do more to help the auto industry, even though Obama’s administration is widely credited with helping to turn around General Motors and Chrysler when they faced collapse,” writes the Detroit Free Press in an article titled ‘Romney takes heat for new ad on jobs, auto rescue’. “In the ad, the Romney campaign also says that Jeep, now owned by Italian automaker Fiat after going through a structured bankruptcy in 2009, is going to make cars in China. While true, that production would represent an expansion or return of jobs to China for Chrysler, not a transfer of North American jobs. It also is a move that analysts say could improve the brand’s global standing.”“Romney Ad Wrongly Implies Chrysler Is Sending U.S. Jobs To China,” reads a National Journal headline.The sense that the Romney ad breached already lax standards for honesty in campaign ads was particularly evident on Twitter Sunday afternoon and evening, when many reporters first took note of it, after it began airing in Ohio without public notice.National Journal’s Ron Fournier said there was no sound defense for the Romney ad.Politico’s Ben White tweeted “Wait, not only did Romney camp not back off the erroneous Jeep to China canard, they made an ad out of it? My god”Chrysler, the company that manufactures Jeep, felt the need to respond publicly that, no, Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its models out of North America to China.“There are times when the reading of a newswire report generates storms originated by a biased or predisposed approach,” Jeep wrote on its official blog.The Obama campaign has dispatched former auto adviser Steve Rattner to debunk the ad, both in Ohio and nationally. A campaign official tells TPM that Rattner will host a conference call to address the Romney ad with reporters on Monday.

By Melanie Warner AUSTIN, Texas, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Former U.S. first lady Barbara Bush said on Thursday that she's ready to move beyond this year's campaign season, in comments that came at an Austin conference the week after President Barack Obama's re-election. "I'm tired now of the elections," Bush, who had endorsed Republican Mitt Romney, said at a forum on America's first ladies. "People spoke. Move on, get on with it. I want to do other things and not to be ugly." Bush, sporting a double strand of her signature pearls, joined former first lady Laura Bush on a panel for the Enduring Legacies of America's First Ladies conference at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. The first ladies avoided offering political opinions, but Barbara Bush did issue a stern warning to both Republicans and Democrats. "They are going to have to compromise," said Barbara Bush, the wife of former President George H.W. Bush. "It's not a dirty word." Both first ladies reminisced about spectacular Christmases at the White House and cited family time spent at Camp David as the setting of some of their favorite memories. When asked what was the biggest misconception about her husband, former President George W. Bush, during his time in office, Laura Bush said, "That he was a heedless cowboy character." Moderator Mark Updegrove, director of the LBJ library, asked the women if one ever can be prepared to be the first lady and without hesitation, both answered yes. "If you are the wife of a governor or the wife of a vice president, I think you can be prepared for it," said Barbara Bush. "Or if your mother-in-law was the first lady and you watched her," Laura Bush said. "I feel I really had a huge advantage." Earlier in the day, during a panel featuring presidential children, Jenna Bush Hager, one of Laura and George W. Bush's twin daughters, revealed that her grandmother Barbara Bush's family nickname is "The Enforcer." Hager also divulged the tidbit that her mother, a fan of reggae superstar Bob Marley, is a "secret Rastafarian." Hager joined sister Barbara Pierce Bush as well as Steve Ford, a son of Betty and President Gerald Ford, and Lynda Johnson Robb, a daughter of Lady Bird and President Lyndon Johnson. Steve Ford recalled that because his father became president not after an election but because President Richard Nixon had resigned, it was several days before the Fords moved into the White House. He remembered his mother being in the kitchen, saying, "Jerry, something's wrong here. You just became president of the United States and I'm still cooking."

Senator Harry Reid has made filibuster reform a priority and four congressmen are suing to get it declared unconstitutional. Is obstructionism finally on the way out?In Senator Harry Reid’s first post-election press conference, the Nevada Democrat said he wouldn’t go so far as to eliminate the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for the chamber to enter and exit the amendment and debate process. But in remarks meant to preview a more combative approach during the next session, he warned Republicans that obstructionism as a tactic won’t be tolerated — or as technically feasible.WOW: Why We’re Suing The SenateReps. John Lewis, D-GA, Michael Michaud, D-ME, Hank Johnson, D-GA, and Keith Ellison, D-MN. argue that the Constitution sets out super-majority requirements only in special cases, to override a presidential veto or ratify a treaty, for example. It does not permit the Senate to require more than a simple majority just to begin debate; and the Supreme Court already has said that a legislative body’s rules cannot conflict with the Constitution.MUST SEE: The Actual Legal ComplaintRead more about the reasons why Common Cause is filing suit today to stop filibustering.Aaron Belkins writes, “Election day 2012 was a great day on so many levels, but one of the most pleasant surprises was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s pledge to consider reforming the filibuster, the antiquated Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation. Senator Reid has made similar pledges in the past without taking action, but hopefully this time he is serious.”Green groups said Wednesday that they plan to make Senate rules reform to limit filibusters one of their top priorities heading into the next Congress.South Carolina Republican Senator Jim Demint argues that Reid’s call for reform would do away with the minority’s historic rights because they are an inconvenience to the Democrats’ liberal, uncompromising political agenda.

NEW YORK - Rep. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, on Tuesday became the first Asian American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She'll also be Hawaii's first female U.S. senator, after defeating former Gov. Linda Lingle."Clearly the Senate needs more diversity," Hirono said. "We don't even have parity regarding women. We have a ways to go."EMILY's List, a group that works to help pro-choice Democratic women get elected, saw an outpouring of support for women this election season. Since 2010, its membership more than quadrupled from 400,000 to nearly 2 million, according to spokeswoman Jess McIntosh."It's two things," McIntosh said. "The Republican war on women woke a lot of women up who did not necessarily have politics on the front burner. I think anyone under 45 thought we were completely done debating birth control, and you can see what these awful comments on rape victims are doing to women. It doesn't matter how they usually vote, they're outraged. That has sparked a lot of interest in electoral politics that was not previously there."Hirono's victory didn't come as a surprise. She's a Democrat in a solidly blue state, and had strong support from the Democratic establishment. That included vocal support from the nation's most senior senator, Hawaii Democrat Daniel Inouye, who has been a member of Congress since 1959. He offered his congratulations to Hirono and her supporters Tuesday night."Since the moment she declared her candidacy, Ihave said that Mazie is the person Hawaii needs in the Senate," Inouye said. "She is the bipartisan partner I need."But for women in national races - especially minorities - it's been a long road. Congress has had female representation for less than a century. After Jeanette Rankin, R-Mont., was elected as the United States' first congresswoman in 1916, a Chicago newspaper had a "character analyst" survey her head. The bridge of Rankin's nose was a sign of leadership, the report said. Her long jaw line indicated concentration. Her neck showed signs of independence, and "soft fine hair indicates alertness."Two decades later, a Miami newspaper described Patsy Mink - then a state senator from Hawaii - as "the cutest senator you ever saw." Mink, a Japanese American, went on to become the first minority woman in Congress. She authored Title IX, the law that bans gender discrimination among education programs receiving federal money. Many people are familiar with Title IX for the impact it's had on women's athletics. Before her death in 2002, Mink was a mentor and friend to Hirono."I know that Patsy's looking down on me and saying, 'You go girl!'" Hirono said. "She ran for Senate, she ran for president, she ran for mayor, she ran for governor. She lost all those races. Here's a model of a woman who did not give up. That's the model I have."Hirono is also an immigrant. She was 8 years old when her mother - fleeing Hirono's alcoholic father - moved them to Hawaii. Hirono says she cried for two days on the crossing from Yokohama Harbor. Another first: Hirono is a Buddhist, too."I bring quadruple diversity to the Senate," Hirono said at a rally earlier in the campaign. "I'm a woman. I'll be the first Asian woman ever to be elected to the U.S. Senate. I am an immigrant. I am a Buddhist. When I said this at one of my gatherings, they said, 'Yes, but are you gay?' and I said, 'Nobody's perfect.'"Hirono says her mother and Mink are the two women who have inspired her most in her political career. But getting to this point has not just been about doggedness. A refusal to give up is not enough, she said."Women are not given very much credit for our ability to make strategic political decisions," Hirono said. "That's one of the things I do. I don't just think, 'I'm going to do it because I'm not going to give up.' It's hard. It's always hard.

Well, the "We the People" petition site is getting even sillier, although I know that seems hard to believe. As I reported yesterday, a petition asking that Texas be allowed to secede was the first of many state-secession petitions to reach 25,000 signatures, thus entitling the signatories to have their opinions formally ignored by the White House. The same people or affiliated people now have petitions going for what looks like most of the 50 states (I didn't count), and of course there are now at least two counter-petitions asking for the secession petitioners to be deported.Democracy is great despite the fact, or maybe because of the fact, that it's so completely ridiculous."Deport Everyone [Who] Signed a Petition to Withdraw Their State from the United States of America," reads this petition, which has no text other than the title but I think still gets its message across. A little nastier is "Strip the Citizenship from Everyone Who Signed a Petition to Secede and Exile Them," although its single sentence asking the president to do this by executive order is itself fairly polite. (Would doing this by executive order be legal? Of course not, but neither is dropping bombs on citizens or locking them up indefinitely without a trial, even if a Nobel Peace Prize winner is doing it.)I think a better response, because it's funnier and less vindictive, is this one: In response to Texas's petition to secede from the United States and become its own country, the city of Austin is asking to secede from Texas and become its own state. "It is entirely feasible for Austin to operate as its own state, within the United States, in the event that Texas is successful in [its] current bid to secede," the petition says. It also asks to annex certain other presumably like-minded cities in Texas. The map is going to start getting pretty complicated if this catches on.Like I said, the silliness does appear to be escalating, which is maybe unsurprising given all the calls for secession. Somebody wants Chief Illiniwek back as the mascot for the University of Illinois, and as important as that may be, do we really want the federal government intervening to resolve mascot disputes? Somebody at Texas A&M has a Heisman candidate they want the president to endorse. (Question: if Texas secedes, are Texans still eligible for the Heisman? Should College Station secede from Texas?) Somebody else is a big fan of thorium and wants the government to stop destroying it. "outlaw offending prophets of major religions," writes someone who (like most of these people, sadly) is in serious need of capitalization training and also needs to express himself more clearly. Do you want to outlaw prophets who offend you or to outlaw giving offense to the prophets? Actually, never mind—those are both unconstitutional.Then there's "The U.S. Government Must Redress Wrongs Against the Chagossians," and at first I thought that had to do with Star Trekbut it turns out to be a legitimate call to help the people who got evicted so we could build a military base on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. So I shouldn't joke about that. But I still think the Star Trek joke is decent.If the thorium lobby will also support the Chagossians, I would agree to take up both those causes.

So many voters showed up at the Miami-Dade elections headquarters in Doral to cast absentee ballots in person Sunday afternoon that the department shut down the operation less than two hours in, saying it did not have enough resources to help everyone.Many Americans fear that the results of the presidential election will be compromised. Do you?Your vote has been counted, thank you for voting.What began Sunday morning as an attempt by the Miami-Dade elections department to let more people early vote devolved into chaos and confusion only days before the nation decides its next president.Call it the debacle in Doral.Elections officials, overwhelmed with voters, locked the doors to their Doral headquarters and temporarily shut down the operation, angering nearly 200 voters standing in line outside — only to resume the proceedings an hour later.On the surface, officials blamed technical equipment and a lack of staff for the shutdown. But behind the scenes, there was another issue: Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez.The Republican had never signed off on the additional in-person absentee voting hours in the first place.“That was counter to what I said on Friday, which was we were not going to change the game mid-stream,” he said. “I said, ‘No, there’s no way we did this.’”But Gimenez, who is in a nonpartisan post, quickly realized it was better to let the voting go on, and the voting resumed.The mayor said he found out early Sunday afternoon — from his daughter-in-law — about the extra voting hours.The move had been approved by Deputy Mayor Alina Hudak at the request of Elections Supervisor Penelope Townsley. The plan was simple: Allow voters to request, fill out and return absentee ballots in person for four hours Sunday afternoon.Early voting the Sunday before Election Day used to be allowed. But it was eliminated by the GOP-controlled state Legislature and Republican Gov. Rick Scott last year after Barack Obama used early voting to help him win Florida in 2008 — and therefore the presidency.Gimenez said his initial reaction was to stop the last-minute Sunday voting.But by then, around 180 people stood in line outside the elections office at 2700 NW 87th Ave. They shouted “Let us vote!” and banged on the locked glass doors.“This is America, not a third-world country,” said Myrna Peralta, who waited in line with her 4-year-old grandson for nearly two hours before the doors closed. “They should have been prepared.”“My beautiful Sunshine State,” she lamented. “They’re not letting people vote.”Minutes earlier, a department spokeswoman had said the office did not have enough resources — only one ballot printer, five voting booths and two staffers — to handle the throng of voters and would begin turning new voters away.“We had the best of intentions to provide this service today,” spokeswoman Christina White had said. “We just can’t accommodate it to the degree that we would like to.”Calvin Sweeting, a 59-year-old from Opa-locka, was told he would be the last person to vote.“They said I was the lucky one,” he said, shrugging. “It didn’t seem fair to me.”Or to Jean Marcellus, 52, who stood behind him.“This is ridiculous,” Marcellus shouted, holding up the ticket he was given to secure his place in the queue. “I’m the next one!”Nearly all the voters stayed in line until a campaign worker reported her car had been towed from a private parking lot across the street. Scores of people ducked out of the line to check on their own cars. A second car had been towed.

Florida is heavily scrutinized every election; partially due to the high electoral vote count and its swing state nature, but also because of controversial vote counts from 2000 and on (younger Bush’s first election). This year is shaping up to be no different, as serious questions are being asked about early vote counts already.Broward County, a Democratic Party stronghold located in south eastern Florida, has already has some serious early vote counting issues. The total vote count was revised by 536 total, from 28,330 down to 27,794. That might not seem like much, but remember that in the 2000 election, the entire state was decided by only 538 votes.However, the disturbing part is that in some areas the count was off by a pretty significant amount — one from 2,945 to 1,942! The Grio, an NBC News affiliate, offers this breakdown:They go on to report,“There could be a very simple explanation. I have no idea,” said David Brown, a political consultant who is working for three Broward candidates, and who downloaded the Sunday early vote totals Sunday morning, only to be asked later by a colleague for the numbers, which he retrieved from his phone. When he looked at the revised totals, the Pat Larkins number stood out. “Almost every one of the precincts changed,” Brown said. “Some by two or three, one by about 100. But the Pat Larkins Center, that’s more than a thousand votes. I’m curious why.” Brown said that when he inquired about the numbers, he was told by the elections office that the changes had resulted from a “computer glitch.”Computer glitch? If so, they should release the exact details of such a glitch along with testimony from several computer experts, because votes aren’t something that you play around with. If there is a glitch, it needs to be fixed, and immediately. They also said that there were a couple transposing errors that were fixed, but there is no excuse for any of this. I would be delighted if you joined me on Facebook for instant access to my articles.

500 voters were on line after the polls had closed at South Kendall Community Church, on SW 147th Ave. They were looking at an hours-long wait to vote.'Don't be intimidated by the long lines, it's not as bad as you think," says Miami-Dade County voter Denise Holtzman on Election Day 2012.Miami-Dade will not report full election results until Wednesday, election supervisors said Tuesday night, as dozens of polls remained open four hours after closing time.Lines were so long in some polling places, that the last voter did not leave the West Kendall Regional Libary until a few minutes after 1 A.M. At 10:50 p.m., 90 percent of the precincts had closed in Miami-Dade. That meant that at least 80 precincts were still plagued by lines four hours after the polls closed, as people waited six hours or longer to cast their ballots.Adding to the local election woes were the 18,000 absentee ballots that came in on Tuesday. Those had yet to be processed and were not expected to be counted until Wednesday, according to Deputy Supervisor Christina White.The ballot was "the largest in Miami-Dade county history, and that has contributed to the length of time it has taken,” said Miami-Dade Election Supervisor Penelope Townsley. "We will continue the count through the night and have a total sometime tomorrow.''When polls officially closed at 7 p.m. hundreds of people were still waiting to cast ballots in precincts around South Florida, in an election that was marked by long lines and the occasional snafu. Even after the networks called the race for President Obama, people in South Florida remained in line.From Hialeah to Country Walk and Brickell, people waited as long as seven hours to vote. In Broward County, voting at some precincts came to a halt when the ballots ran out. At the South Kendall Community Church, 1,000 people were in line at closing time, and at least 200 remained three hours later.At Ronald Reagan High School in Doral, the doors closed with some 300 people still in line. By law, any voter who arrived before 7 p.m. is allowed to cast a ballot.Many voters throughout the day said they waited hours and gave up.The scene was repeated at Country Walk and the West Kendall Regional Library, where staggering numbers of people waited hours to cast ballots.

McCrary Elementary School had a three-hour wait and no bathrooms, while voters in Goulds experienced a five-hour wait, according to a memo sent to elections supervisors highlighting the trouble spots.A spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections Office blamed the 10-page ballot for the long lines and voter delays, but declined to say whether local officials could have done anything differently. She insisted that more poll equipment and workers were dispatched Tuesday than in 2008, and added that some locations were limited by space constraints.But voters complained that many stations lacked enough poll workers, scanning machines and privacy booths to address the crowds. Dozens of workers were diverted from closed polling places to others that faced daunting queues, and 150 extra optical scanners were distributed throughout the day.“We do all equipment allocations based on registered voters in a precinct,” said Christina White, deputy supervisor of elections. “We sent more voting booths, more privacy booths and more scanners [to polling places] in this election than any other.”State election officials said the turnout was on track to break Florida records. And with a shorter early voting period this year, experts said the combination proved problematic for some precincts.

The New York Times' Nate Silver has created a model to predict the outcome of the presidential election that's watched by just about every pundit, and yet Silver's model refuses to perfectly reflect the conventional wisdom spouted by just about every pundit. The pundits do not like this! Silver's FiveThirtyEight model uses math to show that President Obama has a 74.6 percent chance of beating Mitt Romney, even though Romney has unmeasurable things like "momentum" as well as newspaper endorsements, plus a lead in several national polls. Obama's chances remain high, Silver explains, because he has a significant lead in enough swing states to win the needed 270 electoral college votes. The latest pundit outraged that Silver's model doesn't feel right is MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, who ranted Monday morning:"Nate Silver says this is a 73.6 percent chance that the president's going to win. Nobody in that campaign thinks they have a 73.6 percent -- they think they have a 50.1 percent chance of winning. .... Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue [that] they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops, and microphones for the next ten days, because they're jokes."Scarborough is very committed to defending what feels true to him, even when it's not true. In June, he railed that The New York Times kept writing stories making fun of Romney for being rich, but it never made fun of John Kerry and his ice chalet in 2004. When confronted with the fact that he was completely wrong -- The Times covered that ice chalet plenty, it turns out -- Scarborough stuck with his analysis, saying "the general impressions of people like myself … does count in the perspective that active news consumers have."Now Scarborough wants his general impression of the polls to count, too. He isn't the only Silver-basher who is unable to use numbers to explain why the forecaster is so wrong. The Daily Caller's Matt Lewis wrote a couple weeks ago that despite Silver's model showing a likely Obama victory, "my guess is that, right now, it’s probably a 50-50 proposition." The National Review's Josh Jordan's critique is more related to numbers than feelings, saying Silver's polling average is different than the Real Clear Politics average, because Silver weighs polls, while RCP averages them equally. But Silver does this because some pollsters have a better track record than others, and some have a clear partisan tilt, left or right. If his weighting is wrong, we'll know next week. Update: Politico contributes its own math-free critique: "For all the confidence Silver puts in his predictions, he often gives the impression of hedging."Perhaps the most telling critique of Silver's model comes from the people most deeply invested in it being wrong. Romney aides "laugh and roll their eyes when reporters tease them with mentions of the model," BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins reports. One adviser, though, offers an analysis more closely tied to real data, saying, in Coppins' paraphrase, "FiveThirtyEight could well give them a better chance of victory as the swing state polls tighten in the final days of the race." In other words, if the state polls change, so will Silver's model. Which is pretty much what Silver himself would say.Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments or send an email to the author at ereeve at theatlantic dot com.

There's a story developing in La Porte County, Indiana. It seems a voter purge in 2011 went rogue. The local GOP successfully purged about 20% of our voters—16% of them illegally, it seems. Fortunately, they were caught red handed at the last minute, and County scrambles to get eligible voters back in system.In today's paper, La Porte County Democratic Chair John Jones has called for Federal Investigation of election fraud here.We brought concerns about the purge to the Election Board in February 2012.     The scale—20%—seemed way too big.     We brought forward specific allegations of a pattern of errors in procedures from a worker in the Voter Reg office.In February, Donna Harris, Director of Voter Reg., assured the Election Board—under penalty of wrong-doing—that her office was following procedures properly.Recently, Lynn Spevak (Dem), our current Clerk of the Circuit Court and a member of the Election Board, received a call from a would-be voter who discovered she couldn't vote.Spevak researched the case and quickly discovered that the would-be voter had been purged incorrectly.     She asked for the spot check downstate.     The spot check confirmed some of the allegations presented in February.     It found an 80% error rate.Donna Harris was appointed to her position by her husband, Keith Harris, acting as chair of the LP County GOP.Keith Harris is the GOP candidate for Clerk of the Circuit Court—and if elected, would replace Lynn Spevak on our Election Board. Keith Harris has been on two County-wide ballots while his wife was serving as Voter Reg Director.If that 80% error rate holds for the entire purge, about 4% were removed correctly.     That's in the normal range.     But, about 16% of our voters were purged incorrectly.     That's about one in every six voters.Local headlines assure us we'll get back the whole 20%. Our Election Board is REALLY embarrassed that they were alerted to this very problem in February, but failed to correct it.Now let me put this into national perspective, kossacs.Redistricting in Indiana Indiana just suffered redistricting at the hands of a Republican Governor and Legislature. Here in La Porte County, heavily Democratic Michigan City was sliced off IN-02 and given to  heavily Democratic IN-01 (Visclosky!).IN-Sen Joe Donnelly v. Richard Mourdock This is a tight race, but Mourdock just pooped his pants.IN-02 Donnelly barely won re-election to Congress in 2010 against Jackie Walorski. In 2012, we have Brendan Mullen (a Democrat from the Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party, South Bend native, West Point Graduate, Iraq Veteran, successful entrepreneur) in a tight campaign against professional Tea Party extremist Jackie Walorski (AKA Wacky Jackie). Oh, you would never guess! Her favorite issues are outlawing abortion, making birth control inaccessible, and privatizing Medicare and Social Security.GOTV  It seems our ground campaign will get lists of the reinstated voters, largely the 16% illegally purged, with enough time to make some calls:    "Hi, my name is __ and I'm calling from La Porte.      The La Porte County Republican Party took away your right to vote, illegally.      Does that make you mad?      Democrats* have restored it, just in time, and you can retaliate…"*Restoration due largely to work by Lynne Spevak, our Democratic Clerk of the Circuit Court.Kossacs, this is GOTV gold. So please, show Joe Donnelly and Brendan Mullen some love. There's not a minute to lose. Early voting is in progress.

Liberals like me have spent a lot of time in recent years mocking conservatives for the silliness of their media, wherein Steve Doocy is a star, Sean Hannity is an insightful analyst, and Rush Limbaugh is a brave crusader for truth. Beyond the jokes, we've talked a lot about the pathologies produced by the self-reinforcing worldviews propagated in the conservative media ether. One of the key features of those media, and what differentiates them from partisan left media, is the way they talk about the rest of the media. Liberals may like to watch MSNBC, but if you watch MSNBC you won't be reminded ten times an hour that everything you see in your newspaper or on another television station is a vicious lie concocted by conservatives to deceive you as part of their plan to destroy the country you love.But that is what you'll get if you watch Fox, listen to Rush Limbaugh, or consume many other kinds of conservative media. It's not just a diet of information congenial to your beliefs; it's also a message of distrust of any other source of information that isn't explicitly conservative. Which is why it's not in the least bit surprising that many conservatives were so shocked by the results of Tuesday's election; if you're soaking in that rhetoric, the idea that a majority of American voters could voluntarily choose to give Barack Obama—the socialist, the foreigner, the apologist, the black nationalist—another term in office makes no sense whatsoever. It cannot be.As the election approached, conservatives gobsmacked that Mitt Romney was trailing—and who were regularly being told by allegedly authoritative analysts like Dick Morris, Karl Rove, and Michael Barone that Romney would win easily—concocted increasingly absurd explanations for why everyone else was wrong. Then on Election Day, it turned out there was no polling or media conspiracy to hide the truth of Romney's impending victory. As Conor Friedersdorf writes, "On the biggest political story of the year, the conservative media just got its ass handed to it by the mainstream media. And movement conservatives, who believe the MSM is more biased and less rigorous than their alternatives, have no way to explain how their trusted outlets got it wrong, while The New York Times got it right."For a long time, liberals envied conservatives their media, the echo chamber capable of whipping up stories out of nothing and forcing the mainstream media to pay attention, capable of keeping their troops in line and bucking up their morale, capable of quickly disseminating messages far and wide, creating new stars and enforcing discipline. But perhaps it's time to look at the conservative media as a weakness, even the right's Achilles' Heel.It isn't only that their media cause them to delude themselves; the effects sometimes bleed out beyond their brains. Consider the single most damaging moment for Mitt Romney in this election, the 47 percent tape. Where did Romney learn that number, wrapped as it was in an argument about the shocking numbers of Americans who mooch off the efforts of virtuous hard-working job creators? He almost certainly got it from Fox or conservative talk radio, where it had been in wide circulation for some time, and if it wasn't directly from listening to Limbaugh or Hannity, it came to him from somebody who did.The next four years will be boom times for conservative media; it's always good for business when your enemies are in power. They will continue to infuriate liberals. But the next time you see Fox propagating some absurd fantasy of Barack Obama's perfidy, or see Limbaugh and Carlson ramping up another episode of race-baiting, remind yourself that they're probably doing the most harm to their own side.

U.S. District Judge Marbley finds that Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted violated provisional voters’ substantive due process and equal-protection rights, violated a federal Consent Decree, and violated state law by–at the eleventh-hour, the Friday night before the election–shifting from poll workers to voters the statutory responsibility of recording identification information, and then directing elections boards to disenfranchise voters where the information was incomplete or missing.“Counsel for the Secretary unambiguously assured this Court that the Secretary understood the recording of ‘identifying information’ to be a duty ‘imposed upon the poll worker’ and that the failure to do so would not ‘invalidate ballots.’ The Court relied on this statement to the Plaintiff’s detriment. Nine days after making that representation to the Court, the Secretary ordered that no provisional ballots be counted if the identification information was improperly recorded, without [e]ngaging in fact-finding to support the change.” (PAGE 13)“The surreptitious manner in which the Secretary went about implementing this last minute change to the election rule casts serious doubts on his protestations of good faith.” (PAGE 13)“Here the Secretary’s eleventh hour Directive, which disenfranchises an unknown but potentially large number of Ohio voters and violates state law, is one of the ‘rare, but serious’ violations of state election law” that violate substantive due process. (PAGE 14)“The poor drafting of Form 12-B which, by design or by accident, purports to shift the poll worker’s statutory duty to record the form of identification to the provisional voter, did not provide occasion for the Plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief until the Secretary issue Directive 2012-54 at 7:00 pm on November 2…” (PAGE 9)“Ohio voters reasonably expect that the Secretary of Ohio will abide by the General Assembly’s laws in administering a federal election. For an executive official of the state to [flout] state law in arbitrarily reassigning a poll worker’s statutory duty to a voter, with the result being disenfranchisement of the voter, is ‘fundamentally unfair and constitutionally impermissible.’” (PAGE 15)“First, having created the equal protection issue by issuing a directive that violates both state law and a voluntarily entered Consent Decree, the Secretary cannot benefit from his illegal act by using it to escape his obligations under the Consent Decree. Second, if the Secretary has drafted Form 12-B in such a way that it both illegally shifts the burdens of recording identification information from election officials to voters and does not allow election workers to distinguish poll-worker error from voter failure to provide identification, that is the Secretary’s mistake. There were myriad options available to the Secretary to create a form which would have made such distinctions clear, but he chose not to pursue those options.” (PAGE 11)“The voter acting in good faith cannot suffer disenfranchisement as a result of the Secretary’s drafting errors.” (PAGE 12)

see more posts by Sarah JonesThe largest newspaper in the swing state of Ohio, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, endorsed President Obama for a second term today, citing his policies as best for Ohio, noting that’s he’s been met with unbending resistance and belligerence from Republicans and sounding the alarm on etch-a-sketch Mitt Romney’s domestic and foreign policies.Not impressed with Romney’s ever-changing domestic policies or his inability to reign in the extreme elements of his party (Ohio is very aware of Ryan et al’s obstruction to Speaker Boehner’s deficit and debt deals), it’s Romney’s blustering, swaggering foreign policy that raises even more alarms:Romney’s tendency to bluster on foreign policy provides more cause for doubt. With tens of thousands of young Americans still in harm’s way in Afghanistan, the United States cannot afford to be drawn into new wars without clear national interests at stake or to sap its resources in further open-ended conflicts. The Benghazi killings reveal the risks of an “Arab Spring” in which terrorists have gained new weaponry and new freedom to operate. But these challenges require inventive diplomacy and international engagement, not slogans or swagger.On the auto bailout, they praise Obama’s auto rescue plan and explain the differences between what Romney advocated for and what Obama did, saying Obama’s plan was gutsy as it was unpopular at the time – and it worked:Public opinion opposed another bailout. Romney urged the companies to file for traditional bankruptcy — at a time when private-sector credit was frozen even for healthy firms. Obama told the companies to restructure using the Bankruptcy Court and set conditions for government financing: GM’s chairman had to go. Excess plants and dealerships had to close. Chrysler had to be bought out by Fiat. Contracts had to be renegotiated… It was unpopular but gutsy. And it worked. That’s leadership that deserves a chance to finish the job. Re-elect President Obama.Newspaper endorsements might not seem important in the larger context of an election, but they can have an important impact locally, where they are viewed as a trusted source of information. This is just one of many endorsements flooding in for the President this week, and they’ve all been thoughtful, important reads in the sense that they provide an overview of how newspaper editors, who follow politics closely, view the actions of our elected officials.Editorial endorsements offer us a chance at the big picture, instead of the 24 hour cable news cycle race. For this reason alone, it’s worth noting how many of them mention the President’s calm, steady leadership, the obstructionism of the Republican Congress (specifically the House where Ryan resides), the unnerving changes of Mitt Romney’s positions on domestic issues and his damaging swagger on foreign policy.Another swing state paper has endorsed Obama, and they did it by explaining the auto rescue in a way that debunks Romney’s talking points. This isn’t good news for the Romney campaign.

-- A Turlock woman who posted inflammatory comments on Facebook about President Barack Obama has been fired from her job and reported to the U.S. Secret Service.Turlock resident Denise Helms, 22, posted shortly after the president's re-election Tuesday on her Facebook page, "And another 4 years of the (n-----). Maybe he will get assassinated this term..!!"The post quickly made the rounds on social media, prompting Sacramento TV station Fox 40 to interview her about her comments Wednesday night.She told the Fox 40 reporter: "I didn't think it would be that big of a deal. ? The assassination part is kind of harsh. I'm not saying like I would go do that or anything like that, by any means, but if it was to happen, I don't think I'd care one bit."Helms has since deleted the post and posted again about the incident. It reads: "So apparently my post last night about Obama got onto Twitter and Fox 40 came and interviewed me cause apparently a lot of people in Sacramento think I'm crazy and racist. WOW is all I got to say!! I'm not racist and I'm not crazy. just simply stating my opinion.!!!"But the incident and surrounding outrage caused her to lose her job at Cold Stone Creamery, where she had worked for less than a year. Turlock Cold Stone Creamery store director Chris Kegle said he was shocked to read her racist slur and see her accompanying interview."We found her comments to be very disgusting, and they do not reflect our opinions here," Kegle said. "We never saw anything from her at work like those comments."When he arrived Thursday at the store on Monte Vista Avenue, he said, there were more than 20 angry voice mails about Helms."We made the decision because of her comments, but also the community feedback," he said. "We are very into working with the community and doing community service. So when your community does not like you because of an employee, that's bad. We have a business to run."Helms also caught the attention of the Secret Service. Agent Scott Gillingham from the Sacramento office said he was not familiar with Helms' case specifically, but he would check out her posting and the Fox 40 report. He said threats against the president are a felony under U.S. Code Section 871.It reads: "Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the President-elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President of the United States, or the Vice President-elect, or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, President-elect, Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President, or Vice President-elect, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."Gillingham said his office would be assigned to review any report from Turlock, but he would not comment further on any possible investigation into her posting."We get a lot of these kinds of referrals, especially off of the Internet," he said.Helms graduated from Placer High School in 2008, according to her Facebook page, and has the Romney/Ryan 2012 page among her "likes." She is not listed as a registered voter in the state registry database.Helms could not be reached for comment by The Bee. She told Fox 40 she wasn't aware she could be investigated by the Secret Service for her post."OK, but what did I do wrong? That's fine if they want to," she told the reporter. "But I don't understand what I did wrong."Bee staff writer Marijke Rowland can be reached at mrowland@modbee.com or (209) 578-2284.

Conservative MSNBC host Joe Scarborough on Monday attempted to shut down any talk of voter suppression by shouting “Benghazi! Benghazi! Benghazi!” over and over again to change the subject to the September attacks on Americans in Libya, a topic that Republicans believe hurts President Barack Obama.During a discussion about the tight presidential race in Florida, co-host Mika Brzezinski attempted to point out that Republicans had restricted early voting, creating long lines and chaos for voters in some counties.“You just feel like you have to finish with a story, Republicans bad, [Florida Gov.] Rick Scott bad, voting suppression,” Scarborough complained, throwing up his arms. “I have three words: Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi. I’m wandering around my ranch house muttering the words, ‘Benghazi.’ I mean, seriously, are we going here? Are we really going here?”“But you know what?” Brzezinski attempted to continue. “We’ve had a…”“It’s absolutely a story,” NBC’s David Gregory said of the long voter lines.“It’s something we have to watch very carefully,” Gregory added. “And by the way, I think the Benghazi issue, I think there are real questions about Benghazi. There are serious questions… well, he brought it up!”“Why do you want to cover up Benghazi?” Scarborough shouted, pointing at MSNBC.com executive editor Richard Wolffe. “Benghazi! Benghazi! Benghazi!”“Is the voter story I just read a story?” Brzezinski asked Republican strategist Steve Schmidt.“Benghazi, Benghazi,” Scarborough muttered as Schmidt tried to answer.“I mean, kind of,” the Republican strategist admitted. “Is it possible a local elections officials in Florida screwed up the early voting? Yes. Is it part of some big, giant Republican conspiracy out there? Absolutely not.”“So what happened in Benghazi?” Scarborough said.“I think we can all agree, Republicans and Democrats — whatever your preference — they all should be able to vote,” Wolffe explained. “Those lines are offensive wherever they are, whoever’s responsible. Lines should not happen for several hours just to allow people to do that.”“I agree,” Scarborough replied. “Just like I agree that we really need to get to the bottom of what happened in Benghazi.”

In the days leading up to the election, Catholic bishops and priests are warning their congregations that their souls could be in jeopardy if they vote for Democrats. And assisting the bishops in their religious voter suppression/intimidation effort is none other than Mike Huckabee who is doing the voice over for an ad which was produced by Catholic extremists and which was also featured in a Fr. Jonathan Morris Fox & Friends homily promoting the same "non-negotiables." Minister Huckabee is adding an ecumenical touch to the ad by warning folks that if they vote Democratic, that vote will be recorded in the celestial Doomsday book which means that you're in the fast lane on the highway to hell. But seriously, the Fox gang are always whining about those in the librul media who are "in the tank" for Democrats. Meanwhile Fox News' Huckabee is promoting spiritual extortion if you don't vote Republican. Talk about bias!At the beginning of the video, Huckabee makes the claim that "the Church has always been able to count on the faithful to stand up and protect its sacred rights and duties" - a laughable claim given that the faithful who have "stood up" to protect the "Church" include those Christians who have murdered Jews in crusades and pogroms, accused innocent folks in Salem MA of being witches, used the bible to perpetrate the evil of Jim Crow, and use the bible to preach hatred of gays and those who support abortion rights.As ominous music plays in the background, there are images of weapons being formed in fire, an interesting image given that the biblical Jesus is called the "prince of peace." Huckeabee informs us that "unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain." (So we didn't build it after all!) He then defined what the Catholic bishops define as "non-negotiable" issues which must, under penalty of hell, be the basis for Catholic voting. Not surprisingly the "non-negotiables" are not part of the Democratic platform: "The right to life from conception to death" (Personhood for fetuses), "marriage should be reinforced not redefined" (no gay marriage).Huckabee continues his voice-over with the claim that is straight from the playbook of the GOP, Fox New, and the US Conference of Catholic bishops with regard to the HHS birth control mandate: "It is an egregious violation of our cherished principal of religious liberty for the government to force the church to buy the kind of insurance that leads to the taking of innocent human life." This, of course, is the big lie, perpetrated by the Catholic Church and Fox News, that the birth control mandate includes abortion drugs. It doesn't. It includes emergency contraception which only the Catholic Church feels is an "abortifacient."He claims that the vote "will be recorded in eternity" and asks if you will vote "values that withstand the "test of fire." He then identifies himself and invites viewers to "join him" on Election Day and "vote based on values that will stand the test of fire." (Values that don't include income inequality, poverty, and the environment).When I saw the ad, I realized that it was the same ad, sans voice, that was promoted, on Fox & Friends, by Father Jonathan Morris who was using his Fox pulpit, as he has on several occasions, to instruct Catholics on how to vote. As with the bishops, Morris' comments and the video's statements are not an outright endorsement of candidates but Catholic teaching that clearly is opposed to Democratic Party positions. The group behind the ad is "Catholics Called to Witness" which consists of three Florida Catholics one of whom, Adriana Gonzalez is the head of a "parental rights" group dedicated to passing a "parental rights" amendment to the Constitution because, according to these wingnuts, Americans will eventually be forced to abide by the unholy UN "Agenda 21" which, they feel, will indoctrinate children and revoke all American parental rights unless this amendment is passed.As the SNL "Church Lady" would say, "isn't that special!"

While Donald Trump had no problem demanding that Barack Obama reveal details about his passport and time at collegeon Wednesday, the billionaire business mogul proved rather less forthcoming when it came to a request for information about himself.Trump announced on Wednesday that he would donate $5m to a charity of Obama's choosing, if the president handed over his "college records and applications, and passport application and records".But when the Guardian contacted Trump's office to ask for Trump's college and passport records, it was accused of "trying to be funny" and the request was deemed to be "stupid"."I tell you what, he'll provide them to you when you provide yours to him," said Michael Cohen, executive vice president at the Trump Organization and special counsel to Trump, in what began as a friendly encounter.I readily agreed to the deal, and offered to provide my college records and passport-application records to the Trump office for inspection. That seemed to prompt a change of heart."But what's your point? Mr Trump's not the president of the United States and he's not running for the presidency," Cohen said. "And pretty much all you need to do is go to one of the thousand different books that Mr Trump has been featured in or has written and so on, and you could learn more about him than you know about pretty much anybody on the planet."Trump has authored and co-authored at least 18 books, including: Trump: The Art of the Deal; Trump: How to Get Rich; and Trump: Surviving at the Top. Unfortunately, none of Trump's oeuvre graces the bookshelves at the Guardian's New York office – an oversight which is in the process of being rectified.Cohen went on to accuse the Guardian of not taking the story seriously. (Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.)"I think what you're doing is you're, whether you're trying to be funny, intentionally or not, actually it's a stupid request on your behalf," he said. "It's trying to poke fun at the fact that the president of the United States is the least transparent president that we've ever had. He may be the least transparent politician we've ever come across."And I tell you what, why don't you do this, since you want to be so clever. Why don't you turn around and say if Mr Trump releases all of his records to you, you will donate $5m to the charity of his choice?"I pointed out that I did not have $5m to hand. "I'm afraid that you shouldn't be asking the same request then," Cohen said.Your reporter protested that if Trump was demanding that others producer their records, it was only fair that he produced his own. Cohen said: "Do you not think Mr Trump has been scrutinised his entire life?"Surely, I countered, Obama, as president of the United States, had also been subject to considerable scrutiny?"No, actually Mr Trump does not [think that]," Cohen said. "I tell you what, since you want our records, do it under the terms Mr Trump has. Make a donation to Mr Trump's favourite charity."I agreed to a donation, but said that it would probably not amount to $5m."OK then, $500,000," Cohen said.Not being able to put my hands on even so modest a sum as this, I attempted to steer the conversation back to the original suggestion – that Trump would turn over his records in exchange for mine, for free. Cohen promised that he would "take it up with Mr Trump"."And by the way, while we're at it, I'd like to have all your authorisations under HIPAA, for all your medical records as well," Cohen said.Happy to oblige, I asked for an address. But Cohen hung up.So, sadly, we are probably not going to get Donald Trump's college records and passport-application details. Unless someone has a spare $5m lying around...

see more posts by Sarah JonesJon Stewart ripped the 40 Republican senators who blocked the Veterans Job Corps Act of 2012 that would have created jobs for vets. Stewart summed it up by calling them ‘a**holes.’As divided as America is there are still a few things we can agree on. One, popcorn is corn, so for dietary purposes it does count as a vegetable, and number two. (Video of Candy Crowley reporting on a CNN poll that found by a margin of 85%-14% respondents said it more important prevent cuts in veterans’ benefits than reducing the deficit.) Stewart said, “Wait, but the 14, who are the a**holes the 14% that say reducing the deficit is more important than our obligation to our veterans. Who are the a**holes? (Video of Chuck Todd reporting that 40 Republican senators blocked a jobs bill for vets because it was too expensive.) Let me be absolutely clear about what happened here, forty Republican senators thought it would be wrong to spend a billion dollars on a bill to help reintegrate veterans into the domestic workforce partly because of the amount of money we had already gladly spent on wars that made them veterans in the first place.Senate Republicans blocked the legislation that would have created 20,000 jobs for veteranson September 19, and then quickly and quietly hightailed it out of town. At the time of the original story, some Republicans asked where was the list of Democrats who voted against this? They didn’t seem to comprehend that every Democrat voted to advance this legislation.It is great to see Jon Stewart bringing attention to this deplorable political behavior, but these Republican senators should not be left off the hook.Here is the list of the 40 Republican senators who stabbed our veterans in the back:If you are like Jon Stewart, and believe that this is just a Senate issue, think again.Seven of the Republican senators who voted against jobs for vets are also high profile Mitt Romney surrogates. Rob Portman, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John McCain, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte all occupy high visibility positions in the Romney campaign, and they all voted against creating jobs for veterans.The Republicans who voted against the bill claimed that it wasn’t paid for, but according to the bill’s author, Sen. Patty Murray, the $200 million per year cost was offset in the legislation.Jon Stewart thought he was taking a break from talking about the election, but he actually gave veterans a look at what Mitt Romney has planned for them if he gets elected president. If veterans want to know how they would be treated by a potential Romney administration, they should pay attention to the priorities of his surrogates in the Senate.Not only does Mitt Romney not mention vets, you can count on him to not keep our promise to them.The 40 Republicans senators who voted against this bill are back home right now. If one of them represents you, go find them ask them to explain to you why they are opposed to funding jobs for veterans?

see more posts by Adalia WoodburyJust when you thought we knew all the Republican tricks to make voting more complicated, more bureaucratic and more exclusive, Jon Husted came up with an additional step.Four days before the election, Ohio’s Secretary of State decided to add an extra step to the process for people who are voting with provisional ballots.Under the previous rules, Election Officials had to complete all the paperwork that goes with a provisional ballot. But not in Jon Husted’s Ohio. He suddenly decided late Friday afternoon, to put the onus on voters to complete the paper work.According to a report by Brandon Blackwell, Husted ordered county officials to discount provisional ballots if the accompanying paperwork is not filled out properly. According to the same report, voter advocacy groups challenged this latest stunt by Husted in court. Fingers crossed that the Courts will smack down this latest stunt by a Secretary of State who has put partisan politics above his responsibilities to the voters of Ohio.Provisional ballots are used for many reasons, including if someone shows up to vote at a polling place other than the one they were assigned to. This year is also a special one for provisional ballots, thanks to Husted’s decision to send absentee ballots to nearly 7 million Ohio voters. Of the many people who have yet to return their absentee ballots, many may show up to vote in person on Election Day. That means they will have to vote with provisional ballots, and with that raising the probable number of provisional ballots cast. One may think that asking the voter to complete the provisional ballot paper work is not really that big a deal. When taken in the context of Husted’s other shenanigans, this is a huge deal.Thanks to Husted, there will probably be a lot more people voting with provisional ballots, and with it, more people taking more time to vote, since it does take additional time to complete the paperwork. I would venture to say that Husted is counting on voters making some sort of error while completing the paper work, which means of course, that their vote will not be counted. Also, there will be long delays, which may in itself discourage people from voting.There’s still time to vote early, even under the restricted hours that Husted put in place after he was ordered to reinstate early voting during the last three days before the election. Husted set up a double booby-trap with this series of moves, so the best way to avoid falling in his trap, if you have an absentee ballot, vote absentee.The deadline for returning a completed ballot by mail is 12:01 a.m. November 6th and if the ballot is received by the board of elections no later than 10 days following the election.You or an eligible family member can deliver your completed ballot, which must be sealed in a completed and signed identification, to the board of elections in person. The deadline is 7:30 p.m. on Election Day.This man can talk all he wants about a desire to maintain election integrity and making voting easier. In reality, we’re seeing a systematic effort by Husted to gum up the voting process, and find any possibility to invalidate votes. He’s not only a sorry excuse for a Secretary of State, he’s a sorry excuse for a human being.

Judging from recent experience, close presidential elections tend to coincide with problems at the polls. Remember the 2000 election's butterfly ballots and dangling chads? Or, four years later, the 10-hour lines in Knox County, Ohio? Though civil rights groups worry that history will again repeat itself this year, at least one thing will be different: what's in our pockets. Anybody with a smartphone can now shoot video of polling irregularities and upload it to the internet. But someone must still curate all of this citizen journalism, and that's where a group called Video the Vote comes in.A member of a network of voting rights groups known as the Election Protection Coalition, Video the Vote wants anybody who notices voting problems to document the situation and bring the footage to its attention. "In an era of partisan voter purges, onerous ID requirements, and organized intimidation, it's not enough for citizens to just cast their ballots," says Matt Pascarella, Video the Vote's campaign director. In addition to collecting citizen uploads, he'll field a national network of his own videographers to target swing-state hotspots.You might end up seeing some of these videos on the Mother Jones website; I'll be embedded with Video the Vote office during much of Election Day. In addition, Mother Jones is encouraging readers to report any poll problems, voter intimidation, and vote suppression attempts you might encounter via our short Report Your Voting Problem form (available below). We're tracking problems at our interactive map and mega-guide to election problems.For more on how to work with Video the Vote, check out the group's promotional video:You can help Mother Jones track voter suppression and poll problems around the country—report your problem using this short form:

(Washington, DC – Nov. 7, 2012) – The winners in yesterday’s U.S. House races are being asked by non-religious Americans to keep their distance from the Congressional Prayer Caucus.In a letter sent today by the American Humanist Association (AHA) to all members-elect of the U.S. House of Representatives, the AHA is asking them “not to join the Congressional Prayer Caucus and to actively work to ensure that the wall of separation between church and state is strengthened and maintained.”“Members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus have repeatedly introduced and supported legislation that many secular Americans feel is unconstitutional and often favors Christianity above all other religions,” said American Humanist Association Executive Director Roy Speckhardt.The Congressional Prayer Caucus was founded in 2005 by Representative J. Randy Forbes (VA) to “preserve the presence of religion, faith, and morality in the marketplace of ideas.” According to the Congressional Prayer Caucus website, current issues for the Caucus include “supporting the freedom of school boards to open meetings with prayer,” “urging the President to preserve religious hiring rights,” and “affirming America’s rich spiritual heritage.”Members of the Prayer Caucus have supported legislation such as H.Con.Res.121, which called on the President to designate 2010 as “The National Year of the Bible” and “acknowledge the importance of the Bible in American society.” Prayer Caucus members have also signed on to amicus curiae briefs in court cases in support of Christian crosses on public land.  “Incoming House members should know that approximately one in five of their constituents are not religiously affiliated, and even more insist on maintaining the wall of separation between church and state,” Speckhardt continued. “Secular Americans are ready to work with all members of the 113 Congress, regardless of their personal beliefs, if they agree on this basic constitutional principle.”The letter can be found online here: http://www.americanhumanist.org/system/storage/63/a7/3/3494/CPC_Letter.pdfThe American Humanist Association (www.AmericanHumanist.org) advocates for the rights and viewpoints of humanists. Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Washington, DC, its work is extended through more than 150 local chapters and affiliates across America.  Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism, affirms our responsibility to lead ethical lives of value to self and humanity.Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism, affirms our responsibility to lead ethical lives of value to self and humanity.

Former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan says that his party lost the White House in 2012 because so many “urban” voters went to the polls, not because Americans rejected his Medicare and other budget policies.“We were surprised with the outcome,” the Wisconsin Republican told WISC-TV’s Jessica Arp. “We knew this was going to be a close race. We thought we had a very good chance of winning it. I think that the surprise was some of the turnout, some of the turnout especially in urban areas, which definitely gave President Obama the big margin to win this race.”“There’s always an Electoral College strategy to winning these things, and you know what states you need to win to get to 270 electoral votes. When we watched Virginia and Ohio coming in, those as tight as they were, and looking like we were going to lose them, that’s when it became clear we weren’t going to win.”Ryan added that it was “disappointing” because “losing never feels good,” but insisted that the race had not been a referendum on his budget plan, which would have slashed the size of government and turned Medicare into a voucher program.“I don’t think we lost it on those budget issues, especially on Medicare,” the former nominee explained. “We clearly didn’t lose it on those issues. I think what people want us to do is tackle the country’s problems, and what I got out of this is they don’t want only Republican ideas or only Democratic ideas, they want us to come together for common ground and to work this out.”Although exit polls showed that six in ten voters wanted tax rates to be raised, Ryan said he didn’t believe that was what Americans really voted for.“I don’t know if I agree with that because we have divided government,” he remarked. “They also voted for House Republicans to maintain their majority, which took a very clear stand against that.”

see more posts by Adalia WoodburyAccording to Talking Points Memo, three Democratic Members of the House of Representatives asked Eric Holder to order an investigation into alleged tampering in voter registration drives by Strategic Allied Consulting and Pinpoint. Both companies are owned by Republican operative Nathan Sproul and both companies were hired by the RNC.Reps. Jim Moran, Bobby Scott and Gerry Connolly, all of Virginia, wrote a letter to the Attorney-General which says in part:Our inquiry is prompted by the recent media reports that an employee of Pinpoint, a subsidiary of Strategic Allied Consulting, was charged in Rockingham County, Virginia with 13 counts of destruction of voter registration applications, disclosure of voter registration information, and obstruction of justice. We note that in addition to its Rockingham County operation, Pinpoint is reportedly operating in at least five other jurisdictions in Virginia: Chesapeake City, Fairfax County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, and Virginia Beach. We also note that prior to drawing a paycheck from Pinpoint, the charged individual was under the direct employ of Strategic Allied Consulting. As you are aware, Strategic Allied Consulting is currently under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and faces more than 200 allegations of voter registration fraud including registration of the deceased. Allegations of voter registration fraud by Strategic Allied Consulting also have been raised in Arizona and Colorado. The number of allegations in a multitude of locations would seem to suggest something more than the isolated acts of “a few bad apples.The Department of Justice reportedly acknowledges receiving the letter, but has no comment at this time.NBC reports “Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said in a letter Monday that his ‘hands are tied’ and that he could not launch an investigation into the alleged destruction of voter registration forms without a formal request from one of three sources: the State Board of Elections, a local commonwealth’s attorney or a local electoral board member.”We also know that the official in the impacted county doesn’t believe when an individual employed by a Republican strategist and dumps Democrats’ registration forms that it could be politically motivated.We do know that the RNC paid Sproul’s companies millions of dollars for their services. We also know, according to Sproul, the RNC requested that he establish a new company given the political baggage from his services in previous elections.Finally, we know that the RNC ordered State level officials to hire Sproul’s companies.As I reported previously, State officials in Florida and Virginiaare reluctant to investigate the alleged election fraud occurring in their states. It’s time for the DOJ to step in and get to the bottom of this attack on our electoral system.

On Wednesday, Obama will travel to New Jersey to tour damaged areas with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, a regular critic of the president who heaped praise on him in the aftermath of the storm, saying that “the president has been all over this and he deserves great credit.”The collaboration between Christie and Obama provided a stark contrast from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when President George W. Bush’s administration and that of Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco (D) engaged in a bitter round of finger-pointing over the botched handling of the disaster.The storm thrust Romney in the almost impossible position of trying to write a role for himself in the story that has gripped the nation’s attention. The GOP nominee held a relief event in Ohio to collect donations for storm victims, but the event had the trappings of a regular campaign rally, with the candidate’s standard theme music and biographical video. As Romney packed emergency supplies, he did not respond to reporters who asked whether he is reconsidering his earlier assertion that disaster management is a job that should be turned over to the states.Obama’s performance could be viewed quite differently as federal relief efforts continue to play out. Whatever problems arise will largely be Obama’s to bear, just as Bush was blamed for Katrina.“The storm is not over yet,” Obama cautioned during a Tuesday afternoon visit to the headquarters of the Red Cross in Washington. “We’re going to continue to push as hard as we can” to provide resources, he added, before emphasizing that his message to his administration is “no bureaucracy, no red tape.”The storm also calls attention to a dynamic that all incumbents face: how to balance being president while running for reelection. Rarely, if ever, has a president had to deal with such a major disaster so close to Election Day, and any misstep or move that appears politically motivated could cost Obama with voters.For now, the president’s Chicago-based reelection team is exhibiting no urgency to return him to the campaign trail. The campaign canceled two rallies in Ohio on Wednesday, and one aide said Obama’s schedule is being determined by the president, along with White House advisers such as David Plouffe and Chief of Staff Jacob Lew.This aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about internal strategy, suggested that at this point, the rallies are marginally helpful in getting supporters to vote, but that otherwise “the race is set.”

As the US Eastern Seaboard struggles to come to terms with the impact of Tropical Storm Sandy, presidential election campaigning has been temporarily suspended. “The election can take of itself,” Barack Obama said yesterday evening.At least, I thought it had been suspended. But I was wrong. The election can’t take care of itself after all.It’s just been announced that Mitt Romney is to attend a “storm relief event”. His vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan will attend a separate event to “thank volunteers”. And his wife Ann Romneywill be appearing at her own separate “storm relief events”.All good, non-partisan stuff. Except Paul Ryan isn’t thanking volunteers in New York or Atlantic City. He’s thanking them in the in the pivotal swing state of Wisconsin. And he’s not thanking volunteers actually involved in the relief effort (they’re too busy trying to bring relief to people). He’s thanking people who are collecting supplies for the relief effort. And they, entirely coincidently, happen to be collecting those supplies in one of the “firewall” states he and Mitt Romney have to win next Tuesday.And Anne Romney? As I said, she’s attending two “storm relief events” of her own. And where are they being held? Well, knock me down with a feather. Or a hurricane. Anne’s off to Wisconsin and Iowa. Again, neither significantly affected by Sandy. But both vital to her husband's election chances.What about Mitt Romney himself? His “relief event” is taking place – again purely by chance – in Ohio. Yes, that just happens to be the same Ohio every commentator acknowledges he has to win if he wants to win the White House. But let me reiterate, it’s not an election rally. The USA Today story reporting his itinerary makes that perfectly clear. “The GOP presidential ticket cancelled its scheduled campaign rallies out of sensitivity for the millions of people in the storm's path,” it takes care to remind us.The fact that Romney is being joined by “race car driver Richard Petty and country singer Randy Owen”, is, again, a mere quirk of fate. And were I to find myself coordinating the response to a major natural disaster, the first group I would turn to would be my crack team of rapid-response country and western vocalists.Am I being too cynical? Perhaps I am. Mitt Romney has an election to win, and Barack Obama is going to get the next 72 hours to swan around looking presidential.But I thought Mitt Romney and his supporters shunned petty politicking at these times of great national crisis. It was Mitt Romney who said in the second presidential debate: “I find more troubling than this, that on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador – the first time that’s happened since 1979 – when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the President, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser.” Ah. But flying off to Ohio for a political photocall – sorry, but who are we kidding – less than 24 hours after 16 Americans have been killed in the worst storm in a generation is just fine.Perhaps the election will be able to take care of itself for a couple of days. But if it can’t, don’t worry. Mitt Romney will be on hand just in case.

If the election results were disappointing for Republicans nationally, they were devastating for the GOP in California.It wasn't just President Obama's 21-point margin of victory. California Democrats gained four seats in Congress and will have two-thirds majorities in both houses of the state Legislature. But the struggles of the California Republican Party began long before last week.In the past, Republicans have made history in California — there was the Reagan Revolution and Proposition 13, known as the "taxpayers revolt." But just before this election, California Republicans made history of a different sort.It wasn't the kind of history anyone would brag about, says Dan Schnur, head of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California."When one of the two major parties sees its voter registration dip below 30 percent, that ought to be a warning sign that Election Day is not going to go particularly well," Schnur says.That's right — just 29.4 percent of California voters are now registered Republicans. Meanwhile, a growing number of all voters in California are Latino, now more than one-fifth of the electorate.In the past couple of elections, Latinos around the country voted roughly 2 to 1 for Democrats. But in California, Latinos have been fleeing the Republican Party since this ad ran in 1994:"They keep coming," the ad said. "Two million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government won't stop them at the border."Then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, hitched his re-election campaign to Proposition 187, which denied public services for illegal immigrants. That included banning children from public schools.And even though Proposition 187 was thrown out by the courts, "the bill is coming due," says Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. "This has mobilized vast numbers of Latino voters. Now they're really pouring to the polls."The growing Latino vote definitely got the attention of Republicans on the national stage. Last Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the GOP must change its tune on immigration reform or risk further losses in the nation's fastest-growing voter group."We have nobody to blame but ourselves when it comes to losing Hispanics," he said, "and we can get them back with some effort on our part."Graham proposed an immigration overhaul that included a path to citizenship. But California Republicans may not embrace that shift in policy."That's seen by many folks as rewarding people who've cheated the system, at the expense of people who've gone through the system legally," says Ron Nehring, a GOP strategist who was chairman of the state Republican Party until this year.Reaching out to Latinos won't by itself stem the Republicans' decline in California.Schnur says they face other demographic challenges: "an electorate that is younger, an electorate that is more single, an electorate that is more urban.""Each of these constituencies have favored Democratic candidates in the past," he says.So much so that in California, "Republican" is now a toxic label, Sonenshein says."Some Republicans are now re-registering as independents to run for office — simply not to have the word 'Republican' next to their name," he says.Schnur believes the GOP will not allow this to a happen on a national level."If national Republicans begin to rethink their outreach to some of these voting communities, then maybe that drags California Republicans along with them as well," he says.Preventing California from once again being a national trendsetter.

In these last days before the presidential election, Fox News has redefined its role as the "voice of the opposition" by turning the network into an extension of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign. A Media Matters review found that Fox's coverage of Romney campaign speeches in the past three days has neared a whopping hour and a half of total airtime.By contrast, Fox's total coverage of President Obama's campaign speeches over the past three days lasted about 18 minutes, meaning the network has given Romney about 366 percent more airtime the week before the election to spread his message. Put simply, for every minute of airtime Obama received, Romney was afforded a little over four and a half minutes. In all, Fox's coverage of Romney speeches totaled an hour and 24 minutes.MSNBC and CNN were both more balanced in their coverage. MSNBC gave Obama about 49 minutes in contrast to Romney's 42, while CNN provided Obama with 53 minutes as opposed to Romney's 42.*On Saturday, Fox News kicked off its coverage with Romney's campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at 9 a.m. and cut away when he ended his remarks about 14 minutes later. It later aired his campaign speech in Dubuque, Iowa, for five minutes starting at 1:33 p.m.Meanwhile, Fox News did not air Obama's first speech of the day in Mentor, Ohio, around noon, and only gave his rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a passing mention at 4:31 p.m. In fact, Fox aired Obama's remarks for just 13 seconds before cutting away.MSNBC covered Romney's speech in Dubuque for four minutes, and aired five minutes of Obama's comments in Mentor and two minutes of his Milwaukee remarks. CNN aired four minutes of Romney's Portsmouth comments and a minute of his speech in Dubuque. It also aired three minutes of Obama's remarks in Mentor and six minutes of his speech in Milwaukee.Fox News' Friday coverage was almost as lopsided: Romney received 37 minutes of coverage for his campaign speeches, while Obama was afforded just 12 minutes.Indeed, Fox aired Romney's entire 26-minute speech in West Allis, Wisconsin, live on Friday, but aired only three minutes of Obama's speech in Hilliard, Ohio.Thursday's Fox coverage also followed this unbalanced trend: The network aired an entire 24-minute Romney speech live in Roanoke, Virginia, but cut away from Obama's remarks in Green Bay, Wisconsin, after just six minutes. Fox later aired five minutes of Romney's remarks in Doswell, Virginia, but did not cover any other Obama campaign stops.UPDATE: In the 24 hours that followed, the disparity in Fox's coverage of the two candidates widened even further. Between 5 p.m. Saturday and 5 p.m. Sunday, Fox aired 84 minutes of Romney's speeches live, compared with nine minutes of airtime for Obama's speeches. Since Thursday, Fox has aired two hours and 48 minutes of Romney's speeches, as compared with 27 minutes of Obama's speeches.On Saturday evening and during the day on Sunday, MSNBC aired 30 minutes of speeches from Obama and two minutes of speeches from Romney. CNN aired 13 minutes of Obama's speeches and 11 minutes of Romney's speeches.*These totals reflect coverage up to 5 p.m. ET on November 4.Correction: This post originally stated that Fox News gave Romney 80 percent more airtime than Obama, when in fact the truer figure is closer to 366 percent. Media Matters regrets the error.

Breaking up the big banks is a Wall Street reform that Elizabeth Warren may work to implement if she's elected to the U.S. Senate Tuesday."They have been lobbying the regulators to try to weaken the rules, to put loopholes in them, to try to delay them and try to get rid of them outright," Warren said on a call with volunteers Sunday, according to the Raw Story. "If they [regulations] are not strong enough, then I think we need to take another look at Glass-Steagall, separating the commercial banking activities from the investment activities."Warren, who has emerged as a voice of the public against big finance, is trying to unseat Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) in a competitive race. Warren is slightly ahead of Brown, according to recent polls. Money has poured into the Warren campaign from across the country, and the two campaigns have spent a total of $68 million as of mid-October.Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, dreamed up and helped implement the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has been in place for more than a year after the Dodd-Frank Act paved the way for the agency. It has been busy battling bank practices that hurt consumers, responding to specific consumer complaints, and sounding the alarm about growing private student loan debt.She also headed the congressional committee that oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the U.S. bank bailout program, between 2008 and 2010. In that role, she pressed for answers as to why the government gave away money to banks without forcing them to make leadership changes or swallow losses. She also demanded answers about how much TARP truly cost taxpayers.Warren said last year on MSNBC that TARP took away the cost of risk-taking for big banks: "We said, in effect, at the top, there's really not any pain in return for taxpayer support. Not so much so when it comes to folks at the bottom."Though it may come as no surprise that Warren, a consumer advocate, has called for breaking up the big banks, her opinion is shared by other more conservative critics such as Neil Barofsky, TARP's former special inspector general, former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill, and Frost Bank chairman emeritus Tom Frost.CORRECTION: A previous version of this post mistakenly said that Neil Barofsky succeeded Elizabeth Warren as head of the TARP oversight panel. Barofsky and Warren had distinct, concurrent roles as TARP's special inspector general and head of the oversight panel, respectively.

Among all registered voters, Obama leads Romney 51-42 percent, according to Pew.Obama and Romney are essentially tied among white Catholics, which some pollsters call the ultimate swing group.On Monday (Sept. 24) Romney unveiled his Catholics for Romney Coalition, which includes numerous politicians, beer magnate Pete Coors and Princeton University intellectual Robert P. George. The Obama campaign also has a Catholic coalition.From June 21-July 4, the U.S. Catholic bishops held a “Fortnight for Freedom,” with Masses, prayer groups and presentations in dozens of dioceses nationwide. The campaign was directed in part against an Obama administration mandate that requires some religious institutions, such as colleges and hospitals, to provide cost-free contraception coverage to employees.John C. Green, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio, said Obama’s surge among Catholic voters does not mean the bishops’ campaign was ineffective. But religious freedom is not the most salient issue for Catholics during an election dominated by economic concerns, he said.“It’s not the issue that most middle-of-the-road Catholics are responding to,” Green said.In mid-August, Romney named Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin and lifelong Catholic, as his vice-presidential nominee. While many conservative Catholics cheered the move, Romney received no “Catholic bounce” from selecting Ryan, according to the Pew poll. Obama’s vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, is also Catholic.Liberal Catholics, including some nuns, have chastised Ryan for using his Catholic faith to defend his GOP budget plan, which lowers taxes on the wealthy while cutting programs for the poor.Among white evangelicals, another crucial religious constituency, Romney’s support has inched up since July, from 69 to 74 percent, according to the Pew poll, while Obama’s percentage declined.Despite concerns that Obama’s support for same-sex marriage would alienate African-American Protestants, 95 percent still back Obama over Romney.Obama also leads among Americans with no religious affiliation, 65-27 percent. Romney leads among Americans who attend worship services at least weekly, 51-42 percent.The margin of error for the September survey of Catholic voters is plus or minus 5.1 percentage points, according to Pew.Copyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.

Jon Stewart opened his show tonight by ripping into Mitt Romney (for possibly the last time) over his claim that President Obama beat him because he offered gifts to people. Stewart mocked Romney by pulling out a literal giant gift bag filled with weed, contraceptives, and a piñata full of green cards. But Stewart saved his sharpest jabs for Bill O’Reilly over his implication that Obama’s reelection represents the end of traditional America.RELATED: Bill O’Reilly Decries ‘Secular Progressives’ Who Are ‘Bent On Destroying Traditional America’Stewart highlighted how much O’Reilly has bemoaned the end of traditional America, which apparently is a stake in the heart of “Leave it to Beaver” or something. When O’Reilly got around to the issue of whites now in the minority, Stewart pointed out that demographics in the United States are always changing, and there’s nothing you can really do about it.Stewart got a little personal with O’Reilly, pointing out the United States’ history of bigotry against the Irish. As Stewart pointed out, newspapers that referred to the Irish as horrible people were at least progressive in the sense that they accepted the Irish were people.Stewart also relaxed O’Reilly’s fears about American’s new religious outline and the “impact of creeping secularism” affecting Catholic support for Obama. As Stewart pointed out, Catholics were marginalized for decades in the U.S., and considering that a former president once sent the army into Utah to fight the Mormons, it’s pretty remarkable we almost had a Mormon president.Stewart offered O’Reilly some soothing words of advice, telling him not to worry so much, because “America’s greatest tradition” is a “frightened ruling class lamenting the rise of a new ethnically and religiously diverse new class,” and every generation rises in the United States in order to give themselves and their children the opportunity to “shit on the next group” to show up.Watch the video below, courtesy of Comedy Central:

From CBS News in March 2012, as part of an article where Mark Knoller breathlessly tells us how fast President Obama is adding more to the deficit than his predecessors, we get this graph showing where the deficit currently stands:But the total deficit and how fast it is rising under President Obama is only part of the discussion.  From Ezra Klein, in January 2012, we get the following two graphs showing the how both President George W. Bush and President Obama affect the deficit numbers:Looking at the two graphs, one can see that Bush added $5.1 trillion over 8 years and President Obama is only projected to add $983 billion over an 8 year period.  Even the Wall Street Journal has confirmed that President Obama has actually lowered the growth of the spending rate:In case you're wondering, The Wall Street Journal piece also had this graph showing the rate of spending growth back to President Reagan:This might leave you scratching your head about the increase of the deficit.  Where is the increase coming from?  As can be seen in this chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the largest part of the increase comes from revenue losses caused by the Bush tax cuts and the economic downturn:If you watched the Republican convention you might have seen the debt clock prop they introduced as a major theme.  (link)   Or if you read the recent piece by Matt Taibbi, you might have learned that Mitt Romney is, rather hypocritically, emphasizing the debt as a way criticizing President Obama.  Here is a Romney quote:Under President George W. Bush, Republicans in congress voted for tax cuts, two wars and a huge Medicare Prescription drug benefit, all unfunded.  Under this Democratic President, Republicans have suddenly found Jesus when it comes to deficit spending.  You can go here and click on the button that says "Burden of Debt' to hear Paul Ryan, who was one of the Republicans who voted for the tax cuts and the wars and the prescription drug benefit, opine on the subject.  Or you can watch Ryan rail against the borrow and spend approach here:There are those who believe this is all political posturing:Few are better than Senator Bernie Sanders at exposing the hypocrisy behind the sudden interest in the deficit:Let's start by playing a little game of "Guess the speaker." Who is the person quoted below making the case for deficit spending that will lead to later revenue surpluses?Joe Biden? No.  Barack Obama?  No.  Harry Reid?  No.  Nancy Pelosi?  No.  Chuck Schumer?  No.  Some Blue Dog Democrat maybe, sneaking in the word bipartisan to make the bipartisan fetishists in the DC cocktail circuit happy?  No.  Give up?  OK, it's Paul Ryan.  Yes that Paul Ryan.The 2002 Ryan makes a lot more sense than the current pseudo-deficit hawk version.  Besides not balancing the budget until 2050, Ryan's budget would shift lots of costs to states and localities, making the cuts to state and local services.  Here is a graph from CBPP (click on the provided link for more explanation of how this would impact state and local services) showing how much worse than sequestration the Ryan Budget would be :The real world solution to this is to ignore the lies of the lead Republicans when it comes to dealing with the deficit and elect a Democratic Congress that will not lead us over a cliff when it comes to Budget negotiations.  We face three scenarios.  According to the CBO, we can have the fiscal cliff Republican version:There is a second version that involves getting Republicans to cooperate.  There is little or no chance of that happening.  Or we can have the better non-fiscal cliff version that involves having a Democratic Congress: If you really want to fix the deficit, elect a Democratic Congress!!!Thanks for the rescue!

Sean Hannity was predictably agog over Donald Trump’s latest birther stunt – offering $5 million to the charity of President Obama’s choice if he releases his college transcripts, application and passport application. And just like he did in the Trump’s last birther lap, Hannity pretended Trump was raising legitimate, un-birther questions that President Obama should answer in the name of transparency. Then Hannity and Guilfoyle used Obama's expected failure to respond as yet another reason to attack him. For this alone, Hannity and Guilfoyle should be fired and thrown off the air for good. But we know they won't be.With a malicious smile, Hannity said, “I suggest, Mr. President, take $5 million and you could redistribute the wealth with Donald Trump’s money.”Kimberly Guilfoyle giggled along. But that’s not so surprising considering that the last time we saw liberal-before-Fox Guilfoyle, she was slobbering over Trayvon Martin-shooter George Zimmerman and Hannity’s dubious interview with him.The only thing more sickening than this disgusting display of birtherism was Hannity's I'm-just-curious pretense. Just like Trump's I'm-just-curious pretense. Hannity said, oh, so innocently, "All he’s (Trump's) saying – his college transcripts, applications, passport records and applications - $5 million for charity for kids. I’m like, why would anyone be against that? Why would the president just dismiss that?”Guilfoyle, grinning from ear to ear, offered up her own I'm-just-curious baloney. She said,  “Only if you’re a mean-spirited person that doesn’t want to be charitable. In fact, it looks like he DOES NOT.” Sneaking a peek at the camera, she sneered, “Everyone knows. God, he loves other people’s money and spending it, doesn’t he?“Surprisingly, it was Glenn Beck lite, Eric Bolling, who pooh-poohed Trump’s stunt. Bolling said, “Donald would be better served talking about some of the things that are really going on in the economy.” Bolling went on an extended discourse about how Obama is ruining the economy to the eager-eared Hannity.But Hannity was not to be dissuaded from talking up the birther. “I think we can walk and chew gum,” he said by way of reintroducing the subject. With more feigned guilelessness, Hannity added, “There’s a challenge here that this president said he’d be transparent (Guilfoyle murmured her agreement off camera). And yet he’s so reluctant to let us see a little, a little glimpse into his past. And I think there’s a reason. Why would you reject $5 million for charity when all he has to do is say to somebody that works for him, ‘Get my college records. Get my passport records. Here, Mr. Trump, give me the $5 million. Here are my charities.”Guilfoyle added, “If he wanted us to see them, he would have let them out before. Instead, they’ve spent a tremendous amount of money to hide and to conceal.”Well, speaking of avoiding a challenge for charity, today is Day 1283, or 3 years, 6 months, 4 days since Hannity offeredto be waterboarded for charity. Keith Olbermann upped the ante by offering $1,000 to charity for every second Hannity tolerates the process. Hannity’s offer and Olbermann’s challenge are the second video below.Considering that Hannity called waterboarding “dunking,” that should add up to quite a hefty sum for Hannity’s charity of choice, eh? What’s he hiding?You can contact Hannity via Twitter at @SeanHannity and Guilfoyle @KimGuilfoyle.

There’s been much schadenfreude on the left in the days after Tuesday’s election, and understandably so: Fox News, right-wing politicians, and conservative pundits all took an embarrassing beating.Perhaps the biggest recipient of that schadenfreude is Karl Rove. Rove has had a rough week, to put it mildly. After his infamous meltdown on Fox News Tuesday night – at one point in the evening Fox anchor Megyn Kelly asked him if his calculations were “math you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better” – things have just continued to go downhill. Here’s how.1. Researchers find that Rove’s super PAC was one of the election’s biggest losers.Researchers at the watchdog group the Sunlight Foundation found that Rove’s American Crossroads super PAC came in second to last, ahead of only the NRA, in terms of how much “bang for their buck” they got in this election. The American Prospect explains:[T]he biggest money-waster of all, you will be eternally gratified to hear, was Karl Rove's American Crossroads super PAC, which forked out a whopping $104 million and had a “desired result” rate of 1.29 percent. That’s right, folks: The great genius of American Republicanism wasted more of his donors’ money than anyone else. (His non-profit group, Crossroads GPS, did marginally better—a 14-percent “desired result” rate.) Looked at one way, though, American Crossroads had a kind of perfect score: The super PAC supported  zero candidates who won on Tuesday.At the other end of the scale is Planned Parenthood, which had a more than 97 percent success rate with its two political funds.2. He gets chewed out by wealthy GOP donors.The Huffington Post reports that rich donors are none too pleased with Rove:"The billionaire donors I hear are livid," one Republican operative told The Huffington Post. "There is some holy hell to pay. Karl Rove has a lot of explaining to do … I don't know how you tell your donors that we spent $390 million and got nothing."3. Even the ridiculous Donald Trump makes him look foolishThough not quite factually accurate, this tweet from Donald Trump is a good example of the rich dude rage directed at Rove:Supposedly Rove held a call with donors yesterday. That must’ve be interesting.4. He shows how much he’s living in fantasy land by saying Obama “suppressed the vote.”Rove’s election night Fox News performance revealed exactly how much of a liar he is. Yet he continues to try and pass off obvious BS as reality. Case in point: his claim earlier this week that Obama, whose campaign led a large, successful get out the vote campaign, won the election by “suppressing the vote.” The LA Timesputs his remarks in context:Appearing on Fox News, where he enthusiastically contested the network’s call of Ohio in favor of Obama earlier in the week, Rove said that Obama had “succeeded by suppressing the vote,” particularly by denigrating “Romney’s character, business acumen, experience.”Rove’s remarks come after a recent outcry from voices on the left that Republicans were attempting to suppress the vote though voter ID initiatives in vital states such as Pennsylvania and Florida.5. The devastating op-eds keep rolling in.Headlines like these keep showing up everywhere:Karl Rove Is The Most Overrated Person In Politics Today (CBS Boston)

In 32 states and Washington, D.C., voters are eligible to cast their ballot early with no excuse for doing so. For people whose jobs, child-care obligations, or other commitments make it difficult or impossible to reach the polls on Election Day, the opportunity to vote early extends the franchise. Spreading out voting over more days makes lines at the polls shorter, benefiting citizens. It also makes the election less vulnerable to unexpected events, like bad weather, broken voting machines, or terrorist attacks, that could conceivably disrupt things on a single Tuesday. Finally, states that permit voting on Sundays make it easier for churchgoers to participate in "Souls to the Polls" events, where congregations exercise their franchise together after services, walking or carpooling together to their polling place. So why not expand early voting?In 2008, high voter demand suggested more hours open, more polling places, and more poll workers were needed. Instead, Republicans in several contested states have fought to restrict early voting, sometimes successfully. (Did I mention that "Souls to the Polls" mostly happens in black churches?) Let's quickly survey the results of their recent efforts: These are hardly the only examples, but you get the idea.In Florida and Ohio, state officials arranged things such that citizens had to stand in line for hours to cast their ballot. Asked to extend early voting so that casting a ballot might be a bit less burdensome, they refused. It's an outrage. What's the worst that could've happened, a bit of overtime pay for election workers so that more Americans eligible to vote could do so? I don't always agree with everything Rachel Maddow says, but on this subject she is absolutely right:Josh Marshall It's not clear to me that it will affect the final outcome in the presidential race. But let's note that the dogged efforts of Republican governors in a number of key states to dramatically limit early voting is starting to pay dividends. This is qualitatively different from the standard voter suppression efforts Republicans have focused on. No state has to have early voting. Here in New York, supposedly one of the progressive states in the country, there's none. But the intent of curtailing early voting systems that were already in place is clear: limit the amount of people who end up voting. Particularly, limit the number of Democrats who vote since Democrats are disproportionately the people who take advantage of early voting.Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted Says Josh Marshall There are a lot of words to describe what Scott, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted , and various Republican state legislators and activists have done with regard to early voting: undemocratic, wrongheaded, cynical .... I shy away from un-American not because it is too harsh, but because the United States has an ugly tradition of partisans adopting measures knowing that they'll depress the ability of voters "on the other side" to be counted on Election Day. When found out, those people deservedly wind up as villains in the history books.These men's legacies are so tarnished. Unless and until they reverse course, let it haunt them in every future election where they compete, grate daily on their consciences, expose them to the rebuke of friends and family members, and be written into early paragraphs of their obituaries.

The safety net is the glory of America and the unending nightmare of Wall Street. That's why Wall Street’s leading “false flag” group, the Third Way (which calls itself a "leading moderate think tank"), has responded to the warnings that Robert Kuttner, AFL-CIO President Trumka, and I have made that if President Obama is re-elected our immediate task will be to prevent the Great Betrayal – the adoption of self-destructive austerity programs and the opening wedge of the effort to unravel the safety net (including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid).Here's what you need to know about this plan to rob Americans of their future.1. Both Democrats and Republican Oppose Cuts to the Safety NetsHuge majorities of Americans oppose cuts in the safety nets: A majority of Republicans oppose such cuts and Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the cuts. The American people love the safety net because they know it is essential to a humane America.  They know that it has transformed the nation.  Before Social Security, older Americans were frequently reduced to poverty and dangerously inadequate health care that made the remainder of their lives dangerous and miserable. The safety net does not cover only the elderly and the sick.  My father, for example, died when I (the eldest of three children) was 19 and a sophomore at the University of Michigan.  Even though in-state tuition was inexpensive in those days, I would have had to drop out of school.  Survivors’ benefits allowed me to obtain a superb education and pay back the nation with service and decades of greater taxes because education increased my income.  Food stamps and unemployment insurance frequently provide the temporary support that prevent tragedy and allow Americans to obtain useful education and jobs.  The safety net has made America a nation we are proud of and a nation that makes it possible for Americans to recover from hard times and tragedy and to lead lives that are vastly more productive and enjoyable.2. Only a Democrat Can Make it Politcally Safe for GOP Pols to Unravel the NetOne of the most important reasons that more Americans support the Democratic Party than the Republican Party is that the Democratic Party is viewed as the Party that created and guards the safety net.  The elements of the safety net are the crown jewels of Democratic Party policy successes.Only a Democrat can make it politically safe for Republicans who hate the safety net to unravel it (a process that would occur over a number of years) by legitimizing the claim that the safety net must be cut.  Obama may not intend to unravel the safety net. He may have been convinced by Wall Street that it is necessary to begin to unravel the safety net in order to save it.  But the result would be to declare open season on the safety net by legitimizing the false Republican memes that the safety net is unsustainable and harms the nation.  The Republican Party’s and Wall Street’s greatest frustration is that they have been unable to unravel or discredit the safety net. The Democratic Party has its Wall Street wing, but the Republican Party has been Wall Street’s principal representative for decades. The Republican Party has been unable to deliver Wall Street’s unholy grail – privatizing Social Security.Wall Street salivates at the prospect of any privatization of social security.  This would lead to them being able to charge tens of billions of dollars in fees annually. The banks that administered the privatized program would be Too Big to Fail, or what I call "systemically dangerous institutions" (SDIs) because the consequences of allowing bank failures to cause tens of millions of Americans to lose their retirement savings would require either that all such deposits be federally insured or that the failing banks be bailed out by the federal government. Privatization, therefore, is a convenient fiction. The banks’ profits will be private; any catastrophic losses will be borne by the public.  The SDIs’ that already enjoy massive political power, often exerted through front groups like "Third Way,” will burgeon.

Tuesday's elections produced some big winners -- and some really big losers -- whose names never appeared on any ballot.  After outside groups spent more than $1.3 billion in independent expenditures to influence the outcome of the election, we now get to see just what all that money bought them -- or didn't.Turns out some of the smart money wasn't so smart after all when it came to making political bets. This year, the pro-business GOP Crossroads fundraising combine and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce weren't as good at picking winners as the labor movement, which appears to be one of the surprise winners of Election Day.Using Follow the Unlimited Money, Sunlight calculated returns on investment for the outside groups that gave the most during this year's general election campaign. This includes super PACs, non-profit organizations and political party committees. We left out the big committees focused solely on helping presidential contenders -- Restore Our Future, which backed Mitt Romney, and Priorities USA, which supported President Barack Obama -- because their won/loss percentage will be obvious from the election results. The groups listed below all played in more than one contest.The percentage under each group's name represents their fall batting average: It reflects how much of their money went to support candidates who won and to oppose candidates who lost in the general election campaign. Our calculation does not include money spent on primary contests or special elections. And our data is only as good as the group's reporting to the Federal Election Commission. If you see discrepancies or errors, email us here.Click on the "full profile" links to see the full list of candidates supported by each group. One other caveat: We have calculated our "ROI" committee by committee: Some groups, such as AFSCME, made donations through more than one committee. The list below is a sampling of the highest-dollar donors. You can find a full chart of every outside spender and their returns on investment here.Our calculations reflect races that have been called by the Associated Press; we will continue updating this data as more contests become final.

Last April, Bishop Daniel Jenky, a Catholic bishop from Illinois, delivered a homily claiming that President Obama “now seems intent on following a similar path” to Adolf Hitler because of his “radical, pro abortion and extreme secularist agenda.” On Wednesday, he came within a hair of ordering every priest under his supervision to campaign for Mitt Romney.In a letter, Jenky told the priests in his diocese “[b]y virtue of your vow of obedience to me as your Bishop, I require that this letter be personally read by each celebrating priest at each Weekend Mass, November 3/4.” The letter leaves little doubt that Jenky wants Obama out of the White House:Neither the president of the United States nor the current majority of the Federal Senate have been willing to even consider the Catholic community’s grave objections to those HHS mandates that would require all Catholic institutions, exempting only our church buildings, to fund abortion, sterilization, and artificial contraception. . . . Nearly two thousand years ago, after our Savior had been bound, beaten, scourged, mocked, and crowned with thorns, a pagan Roman Procurator displayed Jesus to a hostile crowd by sarcastically declaring: Behold your King. The mob roared back: We have no king but Caesar. Today, Catholic politicians, bureaucrats, and their electoral supporters who callously enable the destruction of innocent human life in the womb also thereby reject Jesus as their Lord. They are objectively guilty of grave sin. For those who hope for salvation, no political loyalty can ever take precedence over loyalty to the Lord Jesus Christ and to his Gospel of Life. God is not mocked, and as the Bible clearly teaches, after this passing instant of life on earth, God’s great mercy in time will give way to God’s perfect judgment in eternity. I therefore call upon every practicing Catholic in this Diocese to vote. Be faithful to Christ and to your Catholic Faith.Earlier this year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops proclaimed that the federal budget must place “[t]he needs of those who are hungry and homeless, without work or in poverty” first — adding that the Republican budget authored by vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan “fails to meet these moral criteria.” Pope Benedict XVI, for his part, called for more robust government involvement to combat wealth inequality. Yet Jenky seems completely unmoved by these prongs of Catholic doctrine.Jenky’s opposition to birth control all puts him wildly out of step with his flock. 82 percent of Catholics say birth control is “morally acceptable,” and 54 percent of Catholics believe religiously affiliated organizations should be required to offer health plans to their employees that include contraception coverage.

BOCA RATON, Fla. -- President Barack Obama's "horses and bayonets" zinger, shooting down Mitt Romney's concerns about the state of the Navy, may have drawn reproach from Republicans, who called it "petty" and "belittling." But at least one former Navy secretary told The Huffington Post after Monday night's foreign policy debate that Obama was right on the mark."I thought the president's line was terrific," said Richard Danzig, who served as secretary of the Navy for two years under President Bill Clinton. "You don't measure efficacy by the number of ships. You measure it by your firepower, by the character of your people, the character of your equipment."During the Boca Raton debate, Romney repeated his campaign call to build new ships for the Navy and accused Obama of allowing the number of ships to drop to its lowest point since 1917."I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works," Obama replied. "Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater -- nuclear submarines."After the debate, Romney aides and surrogates decried the line as unbecoming of the president and a sign of Obama's "desperation.""I think the president belittled the military," said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). "He compared the modern Navy to bayonets and horses -- I thought that was an amazing statement.""Romney looked like a commander in chief," added Dan Senor, a top Romney foreign policy adviser. "President Obama looked like a frustrated politician who knew he was losing momentum. He looked angry."But Danzig, who was himself in Boca Raton as a campaign surrogate for the president, said that he wishes Obama had said more, namely that Romney's claim was also incorrect."The basic point that didn't get mentioned, that I would add, is the number of ships actually went down during the years of George W. Bush and have gone up in the Obama years," Danzig said. "So the notion that Republicans are more effective in building the Navy is not a correct one.""The Navy is stronger than it's ever been," he added.The independent fact-checking site Politifact has ranked Romney's claim that the Navy is the smallest it's been since 1917 as a "pants on fire" falsehood.

see more posts by Jason EasleyWhile the right has been blaming unions for the closing of Hostess, Newt Gingrich and George Will admitted that they expect the company to return without union workers in a right to work state.RADDATZ: Can we have — can we a very quick thoughts of Twinkies in your life? Just — not you, Jon Karl. You’re too young. You’re the youngest member of this roundtable. Did you like Twinkies growing up?WILL: I liked Hostess cupcakes, but don’t despair. Someone’s going to buy — someone’s going to — the brand has value. Someone will buy it. RADDATZ: It’s not the… WILL: And they will go and manufacture it in a right-to-work state, where Hostess does not have to operate under 372 collective bargaining agreements. RADDATZ: OK. OK. Quickly, just Twinkie memories. BRAZILE: I remember when it was 25 cent a pack, when my grandmother — it was two for five cents. It’s $1.69. I would like the original Twinkie back. RADDATZ: Twinkies… KARL: But I just have to say very quickly, I mean, what about Wonder Bread? Wonder Bread’s going, too. RADDATZ: Yeah, that’s… KARL: And this is not just about Twinkies. RADDATZ: You brought that with you, because you like it so much. BECERRA: I’m a chocolate fiend. Hostess has a company in Sacramento where I was born and raised, saw it every — almost every day of the week. RADDATZ: Five seconds?GINGRICH: I’m with George. Twinkie will survive in a new corporate framework.All of the blame of unions by Hostess and the right wing media is a bunch of malarkey designed to further the conservative agenda of destroying organized labor. The reality is that by closing the company, the investment bankers that run Hostess can suck even more profit out of an already twice bankrupted company. The door is open for someone to buy the company, and relocate it to a right to work state.According toFortune, this is how Hostess emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, “Hostess was able to exit bankruptcy in 2009 for three reasons. The first was Ripplewood’s equity infusion of $130 million in return for control of the company (it currently owns about two-thirds of the equity). The second reason: substantial concessions by the two big unions. Annual labor cost savings to the company were about $110 million; thousands of union members lost their jobs. The third reason: Lenders agreed to stay in the game rather than drive Hostess into liquidation and take whatever pieces were left. The key lenders were Silver Point and Monarch. Both are hedge funds that specialize in investing in distressed companies — whether you call them saviors or vultures depends on whether you’re getting fed or getting eaten.”Hostess was a distressed company that was taken over by Bain style management that had one eye on closing the company the whole time. Hostess had already stopped contributing to employee pensions, was swimming in debt, and demanded that workers take an additional 27%-32% pay cut.The vulture capitalists don’t care that 18,500 people just lost their jobs. Like Mitt Romney, to the job killers running Hostess profit is king. The Hostess brand will resurface. It is likely to come back in a Southern red state with a labor force earning a bit above minimum wage and no benefits. The Twinkie will be back, but those 18,500 decently paying jobs with benefits will never return.

Mitt Romney’s son Tagg has been gathering some of his father’s richest friends into a private-equity fund called Solamere, writes Froma Harrop. It’s a clever instrument for pursuing government subsidies, contracts and tax breaks should Romney win.Have you been following the career of Mitt Romney’s boy Tagg? As his dad runs for president denouncing “crony capitalism” and “big government,” Tagg has been gathering some of Mitt’s richest friends into a private-equity fund called Solamere — a clever instrument for pursuing government subsidies, contracts and tax breaks should Romney win.You see, disclosure laws would make it hard for a President Romney to hide many conflicts of interest. But if the money guys are in Tagg’s Solamere, we don’t know what conflicts of interest the Romney contributors are profiting from. We may not even know the investors’ names.“The close relationship with Romney and this investment opportunity looks to me like people are investing to buy access,” Bob Edgar, head of Common Cause, told me. “People are (literally) speculating that Romney may become the next president of the United States. It doesn’t smell good.”Before Solamere, Tagg’s main claim to business fame was as a marketer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Now he’s playing financier. The interesting part is that whether Mitt wins or loses (and he and his wife have given Solamere $10 million), Tagg and Spence Zwick — his campaign’s finance chairman and a Solamere partner — make a pile.Here’s an example of the awful possibilities: One of Solamere’s founding partners is Marc Leder, whose Sun Capital owns the Scooter Store. (It was at a fundraiser in Leder’s Boca Raton, Fla., home that Romney dismissed 47 percent of Americans as wards of the government.)You can’t have missed those annoying Scooter Store ads. A senior citizen rolls around on her motorized wheelchair, proclaiming, “... and I didn’t pay a penny out of pocket for my power chair!” The message is that Medicare will pay. For a while, it did.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that 80 percent of the Scooter Store’s sales did not meet Medicare rules. In money terms, the Scooter Store had bilked taxpayers of nearly half a billion dollars.The Scooter Store has spent nearly $900,000 on lobbyists trying to stop Medicare from disqualifying its wares for taxpayer subsidies. Leder has also given a total of $525,000 to Romney’s campaign and a Republican PAC, and he’s letting Tagg enrich himself by managing his money in Solamere. Do you believe for one minute that Leder will want nothing back from a Romney administration?Fracking and other energy interests have put their money with Tagg. So have military contractors. Dental-management companies have been targeted for pressuring dentists to perform expensive work on low-income children, the bill sent to Medicaid. They’re in Solamere. So are the investor-owners of for-profit colleges, which Romney has praised from the stump. Known for providing weak education, the for-profit schools draw 85 percent of their revenues from taxpayers. Romney a small-government president? My foot.Solamere’s private-equity partners, meanwhile, would surely object to tax reform that messes with the outrageous deal that taxes their earnings at only 15 percent — the sort of loophole that served Romney well at Bain Capital. True to form, Solamere has set up shop in the Cayman Islands to shield its investors from U.S. tax liabilities.Let’s not play the innocent here. In every administration, Republican or Democrat, campaign contributors seek favors. What’s different is the awesome scope of the money involved and the unblushing sales pitch linking investments to an inside track that — via Solamere — would go under the radar.Last June, Solamere held an investor conference in a Salt Lake City building next door to a fundraising retreat for wealthy Romney donors. That Solamere touts its “unparalleled networks” so openly is the scariest part. Politicians used to do these things in secret.Providence Journal columnist Froma Harrop's column appears regularly on editorial pages of The Times. Her email address is fharrop@projo.com

This week, a number of Republican senators have strongly criticized the administration for failing to properly explain the circumstances surrounding the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi. Some of those senators failed to show up for a briefing on the attack Wednesday.Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has been the leading congressional critic of the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack and what he sees as the administration's lack of candor with Congress on the matter. On Wednesday, he pledged to block the potential nomination of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton due to Rice's statements on the attack. That drew a sharp rebuke from President Barack Obama at Wednesday's press conference.But although McCain had time to speak on the Senate floor and on television about the lack of information provided to Congress about the attack, he didn't attend the classified briefing for senators Wednesday given to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, of which he is a member.Committee ranking Republican Susan Collins (R-ME) called out McCain for skipping the briefing and said his call for a special committee to investigate the Benghazi attack was not necessary because the Homeland Security committee could handle it.Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), "who was there at briefing, and Senator McCain, who was not, are members of our committee, and I know they would play very important roles," Collins told Politico.Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), another Homeland Security committee member who was on television complaining about the lack of Benghazi information, also did not show up for the Wednesday hearing. Paul did a CNN interview from the Capitol building Wednesday in which said he had questions about the anti-Islam video, the lack of Marines in Libya, and diplomatic security. At one point he says, "I don't know enough of the details."The closed and classified briefing included representatives from the State Department, the Defense Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the FBI, an administration official said. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a classified hearing on Benghazi on Tuesday and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will hold one Thursday, but McCain and Paul are not members of either of those committees."If you want answers, a good first step is to show up and ask a question," an administration official told The Cable. "That's what a senator does."UPDATE: According to his spokesman Brian Rogers, "Senator McCain was absent from the hearing due to a scheduling error."UPDATE #2: Paul spokeswoman Moira Bagley tells The Cable: "Sen. Paul didn't need to attend yet another Administration press conference disguised as a classified briefing to know there should have been Marines defending our personnel in Libya, to hear the Administration make the same excuses in private they will make in public. Sen. Paul is focused on demanding answers, demanding those who made these fatal mistake be fired, and fixing the mess this Administration has made. All of that needs to be done in public, for Americans to see and hear."

This is commentary from political blogger and cartoonist Rob Tornoe.Back in March, John Ray Wilson was sentenced to five-years in prison for growing pot in the backyard of his Somerset home. At his trial, he wasn't permitted to tell the jury he grew the pot to relieve the symptoms that came from having multiple sclerosis, even though New Jersey approved the legalization of medical marijuana in January of 2010. Now, almost three years later, the first marijuana dispensary in New Jersey, Greenleaf Compassion Center in Montclair, has finally been cleared to begin selling pot to patients who have registered with the state's Department of Health. This will be a giant relief for patients who suffer from horrible diseases like multiple sclerosis, terminal cancer and AIDS.So what took so long? ??Well, for starters, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie delayed the implementation of the marijuana law fearing a crackdown from the federal government, despite the fact that federal prosecutors were told by the Obama administration not to file charges against legitimate dispensaries and their patrons.Interestingly, Christie doesn't seem to share the same fear of a federal crackdown of sports betting, despite its current state of illegality. ??Christie isn't the only one to blame from the delays. Legislators fought over the proposed rules of the bill, local officials fought against allowing dispensaries to open in their communities due to the threat of crime and the state's health department struggled to develop a screening process – all fine examples of our local government at work. ??But that's all in the past now, and patents will be able to get the care they need as soon as this dispensary opens, right? ??Not so fast.Another huge problem with its implementation have been the bureaucratic hurdles put in place for both doctors and patients to register. Christie has said that he didn't want to turn New Jersey into Colorado or California, "where people can get pot for a migraine headache," but for a supposed small-government Republican to rely this much on red tape seems both baffling and laughable. ??According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, patients suffering from a host of chronic and terminal diseases would need to shell out up to $700 for the prescription, including having to pay $200 to the state just to obtain the medical marijuana ID (which, as I'm sure Christie is proud to point out to his Republican buddies, is not a tax). ??All for a simple plant most patients could easily grow themselves in their backyard for a couple of bucks. ??To me, all the legislative wrangling and years of delays are nonsensical. After all, medical marijuana had been legal for New Jersey patients for years, and available in nearly every single pharmacy - in the form of an expensive pill called Marinol.Obviously, there are pros and cons to taking a pill form of marijuana versus inhaling it in smoke form, but to me it is the height of hypocrisy to prosecute people like John Ray Wilson when large corporations have been selling the same drug, albeit in different form, for years!A simple dried herb that any sick person can grow themselves remains illegal, but if a pharmaceutical company grinds up that same herb, puts it in a pill, markets it to doctors and hospitals and sells it for lots of money, that's perfectly fine. ??It's heartwarming that patients in real need of medical marijuana who can afford all the bureaucratic hurdles will have access to care sooner rather than later. But for me, the complete backwardness of our system when it comes to marijuana is enough to make even a healthy person sick.Rob Tornoe is a political cartoonist and a WHYY contributor.

Last week’s Republican bloodbath is causing angst in a series of House leadership elections.The GOP’s problems with women — laid bare by last week’s elections — is the main undertone in the battle for head of the Homeland Security Committee between Reps. Mike Rogers of Alabama and Candice Miller of Michigan. That race, combined with the contest for head of the Republican Conference, is becoming a proxy for a larger discussion about a dearth of Republican women in power in the House.(Also on POLITICO: Full coverage of the war over the future of the GOP)To a person, key Republicans privately concede that Rogers has done everything right to become chairman. The same people also say Miller is likely to get the gavel. If so, she would be the only woman to chair a committee.“They don’t have to pick me just because I’m a woman,” Miller said in an interview with POLITICO. “I would tell you this, if my name was Bob Miller, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.” She said she thinks she would have it locked up already.Another complication for leaders is Rep. Paul Ryan’s return to the House. Leaders are expected to reappoint the Wisconsin Republican as head of the Budget Committee even though he’s reached the term limit for committee heads. That has others wondering why the party’s golden boy is getting special treatment.(Also on POLITICO: 2016 hangs over Paul Ryan's return)“I have told John Boehner that I will abide by what John wants,” Homeland Security Chairman Pete King (R-N.Y.) told POLITICO. “I was told that nobody would be getting waivers, including Paul Ryan. Obviously, if Paul is going to get a waiver, I will discuss it with the speaker.”House leadership elections and the selection of committee heads are always unseemly affairs. They pit friends against friends and force leadership to work back channels to boost the candidates of their choice.This year is not the worst by any means. But the tensions speak to larger questions being asked in Republican politics — like about the lack of minorities in top positions.For example, there are no Hispanics in leadership and one African-American — Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who will be the only African-American Republican in Congress after the defeat of Florida Rep. Allen West, who has yet to concede.In the race for the head of the Republican Conference, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state is trying to fend off Georgia Rep. Tom Price to remain the only woman in a top leadership spot. Republican leaders are confident McMorris Rodgers will win —they haven’t endorsed her, but some are quietly working to keep apprised of the race. McMorris Rodgers’s allies, both inside and outside leadership, want to see her battle it out with Price to show her internal strength.

Women -- along with a handful of undecided voters -- are pretty much going to decide this thing come November 6. The gender gap is at historic highs, and if solely women were voting, there’s no question as to who would be occupying the White House for the next four years.In the last weeks before the election, Romney has shown himself ready to get down on bended knee to woo the female vote. Which would be cute, if he didn’t have a record of denying women their basic human rights. Unbeknownst to Mitt, women, in addition to making handy office workers, are also fully capable of seeing through all the manipulations, mansplaining and malarkey that have been spread around this campaign season. So let’s pause a moment to take a look at Mitt’s continual war on women’s credibility.In the final presidential face-off Monday night, Romney seemed to glow with the fire of the global struggle for women’s rights. Right off the bat, he hailed the Arab Spring and the “hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life….”Maybe that glow was really the tell-tale flush of the hypocrite. Because the funny thing is, women can’t participate effectively in public life if they can’t get access to family planning services and find themselves thrown into abject poverty trying to feed too many children.Mitt has vowed that his first order of business as president would be to reinstate the devastating “global gag rule,” also known as the “Mexico City policy” --  a restriction originally hatched by Reagan that has been used to block federal money for family-planning work abroad to any organization that provided information, advice, referrals or services for legal abortion or supported the legalization of abortion -- even using its own funds. As the New York Times summarizes, “Merely talking about abortion could cost groups not only federal money, but also useful technical support and American-donated supplies of contraceptives, including condoms for distribution in the communities they serve.”President Obama lifted the global gag rule after taking office, a move that was a much-needed step in the fight to end world poverty. Mitt Romney has taken it as his highest priority to see that the misery factor for women around the globe increases the moment he takes office.Mitt’s plans for women at home are as cruel as those for their sisters abroad. Make no mistake: Romney will say whatever it takes to get elected, and then govern exactly as he pleases. In a Republican debate, he boasted of switching positions on a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy once he became governor of Massachusetts. He campaigned as pro-choice to secure votes, and then reversed himself in office to win conservative GOP support. In his own words:“I changed my mind as the governor. This didn't just happen the last couple of weeks or the last year. This happened when I was governor the first time a bill came to my desk that related to life. I could not sign a bill that would take away human life. I came down on the side of life every single instance as governor of Massachusetts. I was awarded by the Massachusetts Citizens for Life with their leadership award for my record.”For a mind-bending trip through Romney’s lies, switches and obfuscations on pregnancy termination, check out a video by Slate’s William Saletan.Mitt has pledgedto defund Planned Parenthood, appoint only the most anti-women judges, and reverse Roe v. Wade. He has lately taken to pretending that he cares about contraception, a necessary part of women’s healthcare, and in the second presidential debate, he said he didn’t believe Washington bureaucrats or employers should tell a woman whether to use contraception. Don’t buy it. Mitt backs the Blunt Amendment, which would allow employers to refuse to cover things like – contraceptives.

LUBBOCK, TEXAS — “Obama signs here are either stolen or shot. So sad in America people can’t have their own opinions.”At least, that’s the caption on an anonymous Facebook user’s uploaded image, posted on the Being Liberal fan page and seen above. Is it a threat? Simple vandalism? Based on the background of the photograph, this vandalism by firearm occurred in a residential neighborhood, showing a startlingly high disregard for human life. This is, at the least, reckless endangerment. At worst, it is a direct attack on the democratic process. Second amendment rights don’t give you the right to take someone else’s first amendment rights. Free speech is free speech.With the recent armed attack on a Denver field office for Barack Obama and the Tea Party-affiliated “True The Vote” campaign being criminally investigated for country-wide voter suppression efforts, it seems that the ever-more-radical members of the political right wing are getting worse by the day. Whether or not you think your personal political ideologies are better than the direction the country seems to be headed in, the United States of America was founded on a strong belief in the democratic process and the belief that a republic by democracy is the fairest form of government. Suppressing or intimidating voters is a war on democracy itself and is tantamount to treason.Both sides of the coin are wrong, by the way; voter intimidation or suppression from the left is just as heinous, although seems to be less prevalent in this election. In fact, there are almost no documented instances of voter intimidation and suppression from the left this election cycle.It isn’t difficult to find anecdotes of those that have been affected by such efforts:And the list goes on and on. When I see signs supporting candidates I am vehemently against, do I disagree? Yes. However, do I ever think — even for a moment — that I should move to vandalize their property, restrict their freedom of speech or intimidate those voting for the other side? No. We are a democracy. It isn’t up to me which candidates are elected. It is up to America as a whole, and that process demands the utmost respect.Here’s another personal anecdote, emailed to my public email address:This happens country-wide. I am begging you — do not infringe anyone’s right to free speech no matter how much you may disagree. This activity is simply wrong. If you have your own story about voter intimidation or vandalism, please email it to acuff.justin@gmail.com.I would be delighted if you joined me on Facebook for instant access to my articles.

see more posts by Sarah JonesOn “Meet the Press” today, Romney surrogate Senator Marco Rubio confirmed a troubling fact: as President, Mitt Romney would sign a bill banning abortion.GREGORY: On the question of abortion- true or untrue? Governor Romney has said that he would sign a bill that banned abortion, should that come to his desk.RUBIO: And I think what he’s saying is–he’s laying out very clearly what his record is on and the exceptions that he supports. And there’s diversity on those in the Republican Party. But he has also clearly said he is pro-life. He has never run away from his record as a pro-life candidate or a pro-life governor before that. But he is setting clear what he believes the exceptions are that he stands for.GREGORY: But that he would sign a bill if, it came to that, to ban abortion.RUBIO: He is pro-life. And he has talked about how he is pro-life. He also believes in certain exceptions. And that ad you have just played, what it does is it identifies those exceptions that he believes in.This segment was called “Gender politics” and the “women’s vote” so naturally David Gregory and Mark Rubio were talking and that’s why no one asked the question a woman would have asked.The media doesn’t get it. Which bill? The bill Romney said he supported that made no exceptions — the Personhood Amendment? That bill, which is the only bill I’ve heard him support in the campaign, makes no exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother. This means that the common occurrence of ectopic pregnancies, for example, could result in the death of the woman.Rubio points to a Romney ad as his “policy” on what exceptions he would make, but Romney’s ads are not known for their veracity or even distant relationship to his actual policies. Governor Romney might be saying he is for these exceptions in an ad, but he has told his base something completely different and he said it on national TV.You would think this would be something to follow up on, but Rubio is allowed to slide around with vague exceptions because it’s not David Gregory who might die due to Romney’s whims.Romney tells the press he is proudly “pro-life” (what a joke — pro war, anti food and medical care for children, but “pro-life” because he wants to control a woman’s uterus) and says he would make exceptions but he tells his base that he supports personhood legislation that would establish the definition of life as conception. Which is it?Romney wants to defund Planned Parenthood (access to contraception among other healthcare screening), his running mate wrote the “forcible rape” bill with Todd Akin (of “legitimate rape” infamy) and now Romney is dancing around which bill he’s going to sign to make abortion illegal.Does anyone get the idea that Romney is mirroring the Congressional Republicans in that he has more plans for women’s bodies than he does for the economy?Rubio also managed to slam the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in a desperate effort to smear the act in order to justify Romney’s failure to support it. He claimed it would enrich trial lawyers. Your 1950?s character for President is clear — we are going back to back alley abortions under Romney.

Toledo, OHIO –  Mitt Romney may “celebrate success” in earning a $15.3 million profit from the auto industry rescue, but by failing to reveal the windfall in his federal Candidate Disclosure Form, he may also have violated the law.So says a formal complaint filed on Thursday with the federal Office of Government Ethics by the United Auto Workers (UAW), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and a host of other labor and nonpartisan watchdog groups.In Toledo, UAW President Bob King brought union activists in a packed hall to their feet with the complaint’s demand: “Divulge or divest!”King’s remarks cited the recent exposé in The Nation magazine that revealed how Mitt and Ann Romney had earned between $15 million and $115 million from the bailout — all subsidized by taxpayers in payments to the Delphi auto parts company, with the payday hidden in Ann Romney’s so-called blind trust.As this writer reported in The Nation, Ann Romney made a 4,000% profit on her secret interest in Delphi through a limited partnership with a hedge fund operated by billionaire Paul Singer. Identified by Forbes as one of Romney’s key campaign donors, Singer has given more than $1 million to the Romney SuperPAC known as Restore Our Future.According to lawyers for Public Citizen, People for the American Way, the Service Employees International Union and other signatories to the ethics complaint, Ann Romney’ so-called “blind” trust was, in fact, a ruse. The Romneys knew the details of their holdings, including their multimillion dollar profit from US Treasury funds. In the complaint to the federal ethics office, lawyers for CREW write: “Romney has not even attempted to meet the requirements for a federal blind trust with respect to his substantial equity holdings [in Delphi].”The Ethics in Government Act, according to the Nov. 1 complaint, “requires candidates for federal office to disclose their financial holdings so that the public can identify potential conflicts of interest and personal economic priorities of federal officials and candidates.”The UAW’s King said he was especially incensed because “Romney’s hedge fund partners threatened to shut down General Motors” by withholding key parts made by Delphi. Both U.S. Treasury and Delphi executives have said that in 2009, negotiators for Delphi’s hedge fund owners said they could force GM to close by withholding steering columns and other essential parts. Ultimately, the taxpayers provided the hedge funds with $12.9 billion in subsidies which pumped up the value of Romney’s Delphi stock from 67 cents a share to $30.“Romney made a huge profit off this extortion,” said King, “and the public has the right to know about it.”After King spoke, Ohio’s Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown stopped by the UAW hall to rally  get-out-the-vote troops for his and Obama’s reelection campaign. Brown told The National Memo that Romney and his hedge-fund partners “would extort everything if they had a chance.”Heath Lindsey, who hired on at Delphi Ohio 12 years ago, said that the company initially continued to pay his full wages even after filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005. But then the so-called “vulture funds,” which included Romney’s partner Singer, took control of the company. In 2007, they cut his wages in half, slashed insurance coverage—and simply abolished his vested pension.Lindsey, a father of two, said, “It destroyed me. I lost my home to foreclosure. I have medical claims I can’t pay. I’m just struggling to get by.”And Lindsey is among the luckier Delphi employees because GM purchased his plant and three more from Delphi. But the speculator group led by Singer eventually closed 24 US plants. The company’s filings with the Securities Exchange Commission proudly state that Delphi has not a single UAW union employee left on its payroll, having eliminated all 25,000 jobs.

WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pledged on Wednesday to change the rules of the Senate so that the minority party has fewer tools to obstruct legislative business.In his first post-election press conference, the Nevada Democrat said he wouldn't go so far as to eliminate the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for the chamber to enter and exit the amendment and debate process. But in remarks meant to preview a more combative approach during the next session, he warned Republicans that obstructionism as a tactic won't be tolerated -- or as technically feasible."I want to work together, but I also want everyone to also understand, you cannot push us around. We want to work together," Reid said."I do" have plans to change the Senate rules, he added. "I have said so publicly and I continue to feel that way ... I think the rules have been abused, and we are going to work to change them. We will not do away with the filibuster, but we will make the senate a more meaningful place. We are going to make it so we can get things done."Reid has gone down this path before, flirting with the concept of rules reform after the 2010 midterm elections. But he backed off the idea under pressure from some of the chamber's longer-serving members, including those within his own party.Sources close to the majority leader say the intervening time period has hardened his belief that the Senate is too dysfunctional to leave its rules untouched. And in an interview over the summer with The Huffington Post, Reid outlined the specific details of what he had in store for the next Congress."The first thing is the most important thing," Reid said the interview. "Do away with motion to proceed. Just do away with it. I favor the filibuster. There's a reason for the filibuster. I understand it. It's to protect the rights of the minority. The Senate was set up to protect the rights of the minority ... so that's the no. 1 issue, and the rest of the stuff we can deal with if there's a filibuster conducted. Those are the kind of things -- if we get the motion to proceed out of the way, we can debate it, one, to cloture. That's good. So that's the no. 1 biggie."Even with Democrats set to control the Senate -- indeed, even set to expand their current majority -- the avenues for Reid to pursue rules reform aren't entirely clear.There has historically been some debate over whether the majority can change the Senate rules at the beginning of each term, or whether two-thirds support is needed, per the Senate rules. The question hinges on whether the Senate is a "continuing legislative body" or whether each new term marks a new Senate. Those who want to change the rules using a majority vote argue that past Senates cannot bind the hands of future legislative bodies.Whatever the historical record, the basic fight comes down to numbers. No matter what the Senate chair rules, a majority can overrule the chair. However, that will likely be unnecessary, as Vice President Joe Biden is known to be a supporter of filibuster reform, and a believer that the constitution allows the majority to write new rules at the start of a term.Some Republicans may be willing to go along as well, hoping to have the rules in place for the next time they control the upper chamber, which could come as soon as 2015.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Saturday said he has ordered county clerks to open their offices on Saturday and Sunday to allow early voting for residents affected by superstorm Sandy.The storm devastated the eastern part of the state, leaving at least 22 dead and more than 1 million customers still without power just three days before the presidential election on Nov 6.Christie said New Jersey residents could get their early voting done over the weekend at the county clerk's office because he ordered the offices to stay open in every county in the state over the weekend."Time on your hands? Tired of cleaning stuff up? Go there in person, you'll get a ballot, you vote and hand it in and you're done," he said in a press briefing from the town of Little Ferry.The governor also said paper ballots would be made available on Election Day, Tuesday, allowing people to vote "old school" at polling stations that still do not have power. The National Guard will protect trucks set up at these makeshift polling stations to enable voting, he said.For those who are not sure where to vote on Election Day, Christie said that beginning on Tuesday morning, residents can send a text message to 877877 with their address and will immediately receive a response with their polling location."There's no reason why anybody shouldn't vote. We're going to have a full, fair, transparent, open voting process," Christie said.He also said the state will soon have more than 11,000 utility workers on the job of restoring power. Nearly 1.3 million New Jersey electricity customers, about one third of the state, remained without power as of Saturday, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.The Federal Emergency Management Agency will soon be working with those who are likely to be long-term evacuees, many from the New Jersey shore's hard-hit barrier islands, to find temporary housing outside of emergency shelters, Christie said.The governor also said he has ordered the natural gas systems shut off on many of the barrier islands hit by the storm because of the fire hazard they pose.

The Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio confirms to Whispers that True the Vote, a controversial, Tea Party-affiliated organization supposedly dispatching thousands of vote monitors to the polls Tuesday, has been barred from operating in that county due to improper filings.[GALLERY: Voters Head to the Polls in 2012 Presidential Election]Ohio is perhaps the most important battleground state this election. True the Vote had signed up to look for potential voter fraud at 30 polling places in Franklin County, a Democratic-leaning county in Columbus where African-Americans make up 20 percent of the population."Observer appointments filed by the True the Vote group... were not properly filed and our Voting Location Managers were instructed not to honor any appointment on behalf of the True the Vote group," Ben Piscitelli, spokesman for the Franklin County Board of Elections, told Whispers in an E-mail.According to the local Columbus Dispatch, the Houston-based vote monitoring group was actually barred because "at least most of the candidates who supported the organization's effort withdrew their backing." The Dispatch says True the Vote originally obtained signatures of support from at least five candidates for county office, in accordance with Ohio state law.In a statement on the True the Vote website, president Catherine Engelbrecht also says they were barred after being informed supportive candidates were "rescinding their appointments." Engelbrecht says this happened because of "lawsuits and pressure from [the candidates'] respective parties" to withdraw their support of the group.The Dispatch notes there are charges that True the Vote may have falsified or copied the supportive candidates names. True the Vote says those allegations are "dangerous and offensive.""This is a final, desperate attempt to deny citizens their right to observe elections," Engelbrecht wrote on the site. "The Ohio Democratic Party has projected paranoia on an international scale by promoting the idea that concerned citizens would dare observe elections to ensure a fair process. If the Ohio Democratic Party thinks True the Vote-trained poll watchers are legion, wait until it meets our lawyers."Elizabeth Flock is a staff writer forU.S. News & World Report.

News flash to Papa John’s CEO John Schnatter: Obamacare isn’t the only thing costing your business money.The pizza chain head has made his views on the Affordable Care Act clear in recent months, claiming the new health care law will cost his business about $5 to $8 million per year. To compensate Schnatter's said he will likely raise pizza prices and cut back some workers’ hours so he doesn’t have to insure them.Caleb Melby of Forbes has graciously done the math on Obamacare’s cost to Papa John’s and according to his analysis, to cover the cost of Obamacare, the pizza chain would have to raise prices by 3.4 to 4.6 cents per pie -- way less than the 11 to 14 cents Schnatter claims he needs.And there are other changes the chain could make to save some money, Melby notes, like not giving away 2 million pizzas for free at a cost of between $24 and $32 million to the company, for example.We're guessing Obamacare won't impact life at Schnatter's lavish home, a 40,000 square-foot mansion in a tony suburb of Louisville, Kentucky, that features several swimming pools, a private golf course and a 22-car garage among other amenities, according to CelebrityNetworth.com.“Who would’ve imagined pizza could build this," said former presidential candidate Mitt Romneyearlier this year. "This is really something. Don’t you love this country? What a home this is, what grounds these are, the pool, the golf course…. This is a real tribute to America, to entrepreneurship."Schnatter is just one of many company heads using Obamacare as an excuse to make changes at his company. Murray Energy's CEO laid off 160 workersthe Wednesday following President Obama’s reelection, claiming his company was in “survival mode” due to regulations and taxes Obama put in place. The reality: the coal industry, of which Murray Energy is a part, is in decline thanks in large part to a recent influx of natural gas into the U.S., according to the Washington Post.The owner of 40 New York-area Applebee’s franchises told Fox Business last week that he wouldn’t hire any new workers and would be cutting back the hours of some of his current employees as a result of Obamacare. Applebee’s parent company distanced itself from his statements as the company faced backlash over his comments.One super-rich CEO backed down from his threat to downsize if Obama was reelected. David Siegel, the CEO of Westgate Resorts and the man who tried to build the biggest house in America, said that he actually gave his workers raises in the wake of Obama’s win. In the lead up to the election, Siegel sent his employees an email warning them to vote for Romney or else.

Elizabeth Warren is one of the most exciting and uplifting Democratic candidates in many years. She is the voice of workingmen and -women, the champion of consumers and homeowners and the fighter for fairness for American heroes who wear the uniform, as well as their families at home. Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock will leave a different legacy in this election: They dramatize the Republican problem with women, and the Republican problem with rape.Elizabeth Warren will be a powerful voice for the people of Massachusetts if she is elected to the Senate. She is the true independent who is unbought and unbossed. She would be a breath of fresh air in the Senate. It is sad to see her opponent, Scott Brown, reduced to attacking her ancestry and trying to hide the fact that a vote for Scott Brown is a vote for the most reactionary Republican senators, who would have power over Massachusetts if Republicans do take control.As for Akin and Mourdock, the former talks about legitimate rape and the latter claims that God wants raped women to become pregnant. As for Paul Ryan, he has one of the worst records on matters involving women, from his opposition to pay equity for women to his advocacy of eliminating a woman's right to choose. As for Mitt Romney, here is the Republican shame:When Akin made his outrageous comments, Republicans, including Romney, rushed to distance themselves from him. And then they rushed right back to champion his candidacy. When Mourdock made his outrageous comments, Republicans did not even pretend; they stand firmly behind him.Are Republicans so hungry for power that they would say anything, do anything and support anyone? Women will remember on Election Day. As for me:I am proud to support Elizabeth Warren to be senator from Massachusetts.I am proud to support Claire McCaskill to be reelected and to keep fighting for farmers and workers in Missouri against Republicans who obstruct a farm bill, oppose pay equity for women and attack jobs bills that would help all women.I am proud to support Heidi Heitkamp for Senate, a courageous woman who fought for her own life to defeat breast cancer and fights for workers and farmers and consumers throughout North Dakota.I am proud to support Shelley Berkley in her comeback campaign that puts her within reach of winning the Senate seat in Nevada to continue her battles on behalf of Nevada homeowners, workers and consumers.I am proud to support Joe Donnelly for the Senate seat in Indiana, to succeed a great man, Dick Lugar, and to seek to end the gridlock in Washington that has done so much to increase our deficit and do great harm to farmers and workers throughout the Hoosier State.These Democrats make me proud. Those Republicans who speak of legitimate rape and who believe that God wants raped women to become pregnant are as shameful as Republicans such as Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan who support them.

Sandy — which was reclassified as a nontropical storm because of its unusual dynamics — came ashore at 8 p.m. in Atlantic City, carrying sustained hurricane-force winds of 80 mph or more and dangerous flood tides as high as 13 feet , the National Hurricane Center said.At least 16 people in seven states died as a result of the storm, the Associated Press reported.President Obama declared a major disaster in New York and New Jersey.By about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, Sandy was classified a post-tropical cyclone. Meteorologists said Sandy lost some characteristics of a tropical storm because of its collision with arctic air. But that collision also created an unsually large and dangerous storm system spanning nearly 1,000 miles. Fierce snowstorms dumped as much as 2 feet of snow across mountainous areas in southern Virginia, West Virginia and western Maryland, forcing officials to close Interstate 68.The storm also had an impact on politics, as candidates called off campaign events and election officials shut down early voting in some areas.Even on its approach, the effects of the superstorm were felt as flooding rains, gale-force winds and heavy seas swamped islands, ravaged coastal towns, shut down major transportation arteries, closed government offices at all levels, and forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate low-lying areas. The tall ship HMS Bounty sank off the North Carolina coast; 14 crew members were rescued by the Coast Guard, but one crew member drowned and the captain of the ship was missing.In Washington, the region’s entirepublic transit system— Metro, Virginia Railway Express and the Maryland Transportation System — came to a halt on Monday, and most federal employees were told to stay home.Federal officials announced that government offices would remain closed Tuesday for most employees, while Metro officials shut down rail, bus and MetroAccess service at least through Tuesday morning.Amtrak canceled Northeast service, while stranded airplane passengers dozed or played cards in quiet terminals after dozens of flights were scratched at Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport.In Maryland, high winds forced the closure of the Bay Bridge around 3 p.m. Monday. The Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge — which carries Interstate 95, the East Coast’s major artery, over the Susquehanna River — remained open but was operating under speed restrictions because of high winds. The speed on interstates and other highways was also reduced to 45 mph.

see more posts by Sarah JonesOn Face the Nation Sunday, Kevin Madden, an adviser to the Romney campaign, called President Obama’s term “Romnesia” “quite silly.”MADDEN: The very fact that the president has to utter a term like that just is a glaring example of how small the campaign is. The Obama campaign has not been one about the future. It hasn’t been talking about what they’d do over the next four years to really help rebuild the economy. Instead, they have reduced themselves to very small attacks like “Romnesia”, which is really quite frankly silly for the president of the United States, as the leader of the free world, to begin uttering.Coming as this does from the folks who have been sneering “ObamaCare” as an insult for four years, I find this perplexing. Is it Presidential, then, to jeer like a teen bully, “Death Panels,” “Democrat president” and “ObamaCare”?Romney can dish it out: The President isn’t “Anglo-Saxon enough”, false allegations that the President is cutting “welfare to work” — racist dog whistles of the lowest sort — but Mitt can’t take a little Romnesia.Romnesia is “silly” to the Romney camp, whereas grown adults sneering “ObamaCare” for four years and accusing the President of the lie of the Year (“Death Panels”) is perfectly Presidential.What this really tells us is that Romnesia hit Romney where he lives, smack in the center of his biggest weakness. Romney does not stand for anything other than thinking that he is entitled to be the next President. He shifts positions depending on the audience he’s speaking to, and after 6 years of this, it’s fair to say he has Romnesia when he denies ever saying what he is on video as having said just an hour ago.

This is a long post but it’s about something pretty interesting so I hope you’ll indulge …Like many folks, Occupy Wall Street has been some doing good work in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, helping people on the ground.Now OWS is launching the ROLLING JUBILEE, a program that has been in development for months. OWS is going to start buying distressed debt (medical bills, student loans, etc.) in order to forgive it. As a test run, we spent $500, which bought $14,000 of distressed debt. We then ERASED THAT DEBT. (If you’re a debt broker, once you own someone’s debt you can do whatever you want with it — traditionally, you hound debtors to their grave trying to collect. We’re playing a different game. A MORE AWESOME GAME.)This is a simple, powerful way to help folks in need — to free them from heavy debt loads so they can focus on being productive, happy and healthy. As you can see from our test run, the return on investment approaches 30:1. That’s a crazy bargain!Now, after many consultations with attorneys, the IRS, and our moles in the debt-brokerage world, we are ready to take the Rolling Jubilee program LIVE and NATIONWIDE, buying debt in communities that have been struggling during the recession.We’re kicking things off with a show called THE PEOPLE’S BAILOUT at Le Poisson Rouge on Thursday, November 15. It will also stream online, like a good ol’-fashioned telethon!- TUNDE ADEBIMPE and KYP MALONE (TV on the Radio)and other great talents including a group of radical nuns! I’ll be playing the role of JERRY LEWIS, emceeing in my tuxedo from MEN’S WEARHOUSE.This will be a joyful, positive night about people banding together and subverting a predatory financial system in order to help each other. BOOM! That’s a movie pitch right there, goddamn why am I not a Hollywood mogul?!Anyway, HERE IS THE INFORMATION about THE PEOPLE’S BAILOUT:- The LIVE SHOW is at Le Poisson Rouge on THURSDAY 11/15, 8 - 11 PM. Tickets are $25 (each ticket buys $500 of distressed debt).- The LIVE STREAM will be at http://rollingjubilee.org (you’ll be able to donate online)- The HASHTAG is #peoplesbailoutHOW YOU CAN HELP:- Spread the word! Share this info with your friends, family, and followers- Donate money via http://rollingjubilee.org$25 abolishes an estimated $500 worth of debt$50 abolishes an estimated $1000 worth of debt$100 abolishes an estimated $2000 worth of debt$250 abolishes an estimated $5000 worth of debt- Host a live-stream party! Get together with folks in your town and watch the show online and donate money and maybe even drink a beer if you’re feeling crazy.- If you are Jerry Seinfeld or Bill Cosby: Call me about doing a set at the live show!

PROVIDENCE, RI—United States Attorney Peter F. Neronha announced today that his office and the local office of the FBI will lead efforts in Rhode Island in connection with the Justice Department’s nationwide Election Day Program for the upcoming November 6, 2012 general elections. Assistant U.S. Attorney Terrence P. Donnelly has been appointed to serve as the District Election Officer (DEO) for the District of Rhode Island and in that capacity is responsible for overseeing the district’s handling of complaints of election fraud and voting rights abuses in consultation with Justice Department Headquarters in Washington.United States Attorney Neronha said, “Every citizen must be able to vote without interference or discrimination and to have that vote counted without it being stolen because of fraud. The Department of Justice will act promptly and aggressively to protect the integrity of the election process.”The Department of Justice has an important role in deterring election fraud and discrimination at the polls and combating these violations whenever and wherever they occur. The department’s long-standing Election Day Program furthers these goals and also seeks to ensure public confidence in the integrity of the election process by providing local points of contact within the Department for the public to report possible election fraud and voting rights violations while the polls are open on Election Day.Federal law protects against such crimes as intimidating or bribing voters, buying and selling votes, altering vote tallies, stuffing ballot boxes, and marking ballots for voters against their wishes or without their input. It also contains special protections for the rights of voters and provides that they can vote free from acts that intimidate or harass them. For example, actions of persons designed to interrupt or intimidate voters at polling places by questioning or challenging them or by photographing or videotaping them, under the pretext that these are actions to uncover illegal voting, may violate federal voting rights law. Further, federal law protects the right of voters to mark their own ballots or to be assisted by a person of their choice.The franchise is the cornerstone of American democracy. We all must ensure that those who are entitled to the franchise exercise it if they choose and that those who seek to corrupt it are brought to justice. In order to respond to complaints of election fraud or voting rights abuses on November 6, 2012, and to ensure that such complaints are directed to the appropriate authorities, United States Attorney Neronha stated that AUSA Donnelly will be on duty in this district while the polls are open. To report suspected election fraud or voting rights abuses at the polls, Mr. Donnelly can be reached by the public at (401) 709-5068.In addition, the FBI will have special agents available in each field office and resident agency throughout the country to receive allegations of election fraud and other election abuses on Election Day. The local FBI resident agency in Rhode Island can be reached by the public at (401) 272-8310.Complaints about ballot access problems or discrimination can be made directly to the Civil Rights Division’s Voting Section in Washington at 1-800-253-3931 or (202) 307-2767.United States Attorney Neronha said, “Ensuring free and fair elections depends in large part on the cooperation of the American electorate. It is imperative that those who have specific information about discrimination or election fraud make that information available immediately to my office, the FBI, or the Civil Rights Division.”

WASHINGTON ? For his first annual budget next week, President Obama has banned four accounting gimmicks that President George W. Bush used to make deficit projections look smaller. The price of more honest bookkeeping: A budget that is $2.7 trillion deeper in the red over the next decade than it would otherwise appear, according to administration officials.The new accounting involves spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Medicare reimbursements to physicians and the cost of disaster responses.But the biggest adjustment will deal with revenues from the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax system enacted in 1969 to prevent the wealthy from using tax shelters to avoid paying any income tax.Even with bigger deficit projections, the Obama administration will put the country on “a sustainable fiscal course” by the end of Mr. Obama’s term, Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Thursday in an interview. Mr. Orszag did not provide details of how the administration would reduce a deficit expected to reach at least $1.5 trillion this year.Mr. Obama’s banishment of the gimmicks, which have been widely criticized, is in keeping with his promise to run a more transparent government.Fiscal sleight of hand has long been a staple of federal budgets, giving rise to phrases like “rosy scenario” and “magic asterisks.”The $2.7 trillion in additional deficit spending, Mr. Orszag said, is “a huge amount of money that would just be kind of a magic asterisk in previous budgets.”“The president prefers to tell the truth,” he said, “rather than make the numbers look better by pretending.”Recent presidents and Congresses were complicit in the ploy involving the alternative minimum tax. While that tax was intended to hit the wealthiest taxpayers, it was not indexed for inflation. That fact and the tax breaks of the Bush years have meant that it could affect millions of middle-class taxpayers.If they paid it, the government would get billions of dollars more in tax revenues, which is what past budgets have projected. But it would also probably mean a taxpayer revolt. So each year the White House and Congress agree to “patch” the alternative tax for inflation, and the extra revenues never materialize.Nearly $70 billion of the just-enacted $787 billion economic recovery plan reflected the bookkeeping cost of adjusting the alternative tax for a year.The White House budget office calculates that over the next decade, the tax would add $1.2 trillion in revenues. But Mr. Obama is not counting those revenues, and he is adding $218 billion to the 10-year deficit projections to reflect the added interest the government would pay for its extra debt.As for war costs, Mr. Bush included little or none in his annual military budgets, instead routinely asking Congress for supplemental appropriations during the year. Mr. Obama will include cost projections for every year through the 2019 fiscal year to cover “overseas military contingencies” ? nearly $500 billion over 10 years.For Medicare, Mr. Bush routinely budgeted less than actual costs for payments to physicians, although he and Congress regularly waived a law mandating the lower reimbursements for fear that doctors would quit serving beneficiaries in protest.Mr. Obama will budget $401 billion over 10 years for higher costs and interest on the debt.He will also budget $273 billion in that period for natural disasters. Every year the government pays billions for disaster relief, but presidents and lawmakers have long ignored budget reformers’ calls for a contingency account to reflect that certainty.

A consortium of media outlets that had planned to sponsor the final US Senate debate abandoned the plan Tuesday, after Senator Scott Brown said he did not believe another debate was necessary and that he would not be able to reschedule the one that was canceled because of Hurricane Sandy.Brown made that statement ­after insisting for days that he was eager for a final face-off with Elizabeth Warren.On Friday he had said there was no way that Hurricane Sandy would prevent him from taking on Warren on Tuesday as scheduled.“That’s why I have a truck,” Brown told WBZ-TV on Friday. “You know, it has four-wheel drive. If she needs a ride, I’m happy to pick her up, and I’ll be there, providing the electricity is on.”Even Monday morning, when Massachusetts was under a state of emergency, Brown was resolute when speaking with reporters at the state’s emergency management bunker in Framingham.“If it’s appropriate we’ll have it tomorrow,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “If not we’ll just do it the next day or the next day. Certainly we’re going to do it, I think the people want to hear where we stand on all the final issues, a couple of days before the election.”But later that afternoon his campaign said he would not appear at the Tuesday debate, saying it was time to focus on storm recovery. While negotiations continued, and Warren agreed to a debate on Thursday, Brown ultimately said it was not logistically possible.“With only days remaining in the campaign, and with a long-planned bus tour kicking off Thursday through Election Day that will take Scott Brown to every corner of the Commonwealth, our calendar simply cannot accommodate a rescheduling of this fourth debate and the planning and preparation that would go into it,” campaign manager Jim Barnett said in a statement Tuesday.Warren’s campaign manager, Mindy Myers, accused Brown Tuesday night of dodging the debate. “Elizabeth was working with the debate organizers to move forward on Thursday. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, Scott Brown is again ducking questions about his record,” she said in a statement Tuesday night.The consortium hosting the debate, which includes the Globe, said it had offered multiple options to both campaigns.“This is very disappointing for all the citizens who will not have an opportunity to hear directly from the candidates a week before this important election,” said WGBH executive producer Linda Polach, who has been coordinating the effort for the consortium.The debate was to be moderated by CNN reporter John King and broadcast on a number of local TV and radio stations. It was to be their fourth and final debate, and the first since an Oct. 10 forum .It would have been the final opportunity for voters to see the candidates together, with the election less than a week away. A Globe poll released Monday found that 39 percent of voters had not seen the previous three debates between Brown, a Republican, and Warren, a Democrat.Both candidates canceled campaign events on Tuesday, but continued to appear in public, assessing storm damage.By Tuesday morning, Brown was sounding increasingly reluctant to reschedule, referring questions to his campaign.Brown said that in addition to a scheduling conflict on Thursday, there was no need to debate Warren again. “I had two radio debates that she didn’t participate in, so people know where we stand on the issues and I’m going to continue to do my job,” Brown said.Warren’s campaign said she had agreed to additional debates in Worcester, the South Coast, and a forum hosted by the NAACP that Brown had declined.“My view is that the people of Massachusetts have a right to hear from the two candidates for this important Senate race, a right to hear from us face to face,” Warren said during a visit to Westport on Tuesday. “We’ve had three debates but everyone was counting on one more before the election. I think it’s important for the people of Massachusetts to hear directly from the candidates.”

Nearly a third of votes cast in Arizona remained uncounted the day after the election. Most of them were probably cast by Latinos, organized and newly registered by multiple civil rights groups in the state to combat candidates like the notorious Maricopa County Sheriff, Joe Arpaio.On Thursday, the Secretary of State, Ken Bennett, announced the figures: 631,274 early and provisional ballots remained uncounted out of a total of 1.8 million votes. At least 350,000 of them are from Maricopa County (Phoenix metropolitan area), where Joe Arpaio has already claimed victory. Activist Randy Parraz, president of Citizens for a Better Arizona, told the Huffington Post, “We’re not conceding anything until every vote is counted. They’re just going to act like, ‘Oh, the election’s over, Arpaio wins.’ Hell no.”Three Congressional races also remain in limbo. Although Democrat Rich Carmona originally conceded the Senate seat to Jeff Flake on election night, he changed his mind after hearing the unprecedented number of uncounted votes. On Friday, he sent this message to supporters: “We will take every necessary step to make sure all of our supporters’ ballots are counted.” Two U.S. House races are also too close to call until the remainder of the votes are tallied.Protestors from a coalition of rights groups are maintaining a continuous presence outside of the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center. In a letter to the county recorder, Helen Purcell, the American Civil Liberties wrote that the “public confidence in the voting process” was at risk.The situation has attracted attention all across the nation. Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid weighed in, issuing a statement of his concern: “All of the votes in Arizona must be counted promptly, accurately and equally. The uncounted votes in Maricopa County alone represent a major portion of the total votes cast in Arizona on Tuesday.” He also pointed out that this problem occurs just as the Supreme Court is ready to consider whether the voter protections in 1965?s Voter Rights Act should be scaled back. Specifically, the justices are being asked to rule that the part that prevents states from disenfranchising minorities is no longer relevant.While Secretary of State Bennett tried to attribute the record-setting proportion of uncounted ballots to redistricting, the civil rights groups smell voter suppression. After all,Maricopa County gave out incorrect voting information to Latinos before the election, Jeff Flake’s senatorial campaign spread misinformation about polling places in robocalls and, in 2008, the ACLU called Pima County (Tucson metropolitan area) tops in the country for voter suppression because officials threw out 18% of the provisional ballots cast.So hold up on the congratulations for Arpaio, Flake, and a number of other office seekers in the state. Arizona’s got a problem. Perhaps the new Congress would like to take up election reform in order to find a solution.I’d be delighted if you joined me on Facebook or checked out my blog.

With Election Day taking place in the United States tomorrow (Nov. 6), Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney is getting exponentially more heated. As one of the few subjects that truly divides groups of human begins into two halves, politics constantly draws passionate statement from people of all backgrounds. One of those backgrounds happens to be playing bass and providing vocals for Motorhead, with the legendary Lemmy Kilmister offering his two cents on the election.During a recent discussion with Rolling Stone, Lemmy was talking about his inclusion for a Chuck Berry tribute concert. During the conversation, Rolling Stone journalist Patrick Doyle shared an experience he had while interviewing Berry, who teared up while saying, “My dad said, ‘I don’t know if we’ll live to see it, but one day we will [have an African-American President] – and thank God that I have.’”Lemmy responded to the story with a passionate statement of his own. “I would have said America wasn’t ready for it. And I don’t think they were, because they’re trying to drag him down now,” begins Lemmy. “I mean, the poor f—er’s only just gotten rid of all that George Bush s–t that he left, or is trying to. And he’s being stonewalled by the f—ing Congress all the time. I don’t know how he’s gotten anything done. They should be glad. I mean the alternative is Mitt Romney. Please, please don’t vote for Mitt Romney. F— him. Repeal abortion law is the first thing he’ll do. F—ing monster.”When Lemmy was asked whether he had been watching the debates, the musician responded, “I couldn’t bear it.”Be sure to head out and vote tomorrow (Nov. 6), but in the meantime, make sure you cast your vote for our President of Heavy Metal election. Lemmy almost made it to the final round, but was defeated by Rob Zombie, who faces Ozzy Osbourne for the sacred title.Vote in the President of Heavy Metal Election

President Obama on Wednesday criticized Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's controversial comments on rape, saying that the Indiana Republican was wrong when he called pregnancy resulting from rape "something God intended to happen.""I don't know how these guys come up with these ideas," Obama said during a taping of "The Tonight Show" in Burbank, Calif. "Let me make a very simple proposition. Rape is rape. It is a crime.""These various distinctions about rape don't make too much sense to me, don't make any sense to me," he said.(Also on POLITICO: Exclusive interview: Mourdock braces for fallout)Obama also laid out a contrast between his position on women's issues and Mitt Romney's, saying that "Roe vs. Wade is probably hanging in the balance" depending on the outcome of the presidential race and the winner's eventual Supreme Court appointments.Obama added that Mourdock's remarks are evidence of why government shouldn't make decisions on women's health."This is exactly why you don't want a bunch of politicians, mostly male, making decisions about women's health care decisions. Women are capable of making these decisions in consultation with their partners, with their doctors," he said to loud applause. "And for politicians to want to intrude in this stuff, oftentimes without any information, is a huge problem. And this is obviously part of what's stake at this election."Mourdock's comment, made Tuesday, has mobilized the Obama campaign and Democrats to call on Mitt Romney to distance himself from the Senate candidate.(Also on POLITICO: GOP splits over Mourdock comment)The Romney campaign distanced itself from Mourdock's statement on rape, but still supports the candidate and has not asked him to stop using an ad featuring Romney. "Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock, and Mr. Mourdock's comments do not reflect Gov. Romney's views. We disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest but still support him," press secretary Andrea Saul said.But other prominent Republicans are still weighing their options on Mourdock. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said his support for the Indiana Republican “depends on what he does.”“If he apologizes and says he misspoke and he was wrong and asks the people to forgive him, I would be the first" to support him, McCain said on CNN's “Anderson Cooper 360.”Earlier Wednesday, the Obama campaign released a web video juxtaposing clips from Romney's pro-Mourdock ad with Mourdock's remarks on rape. The video ends with message, "Mitt Romney: extremely conservative to this day."

This is a guest post by political scientists Brian Crisher and Mark Souva.In the last debate, Governor Romney made the claim that the USNavy is the smallest it’s been since 1916 implying that the USNavy is regressing in terms of overall strength. How accurate is this claim? We recently compiled a new data set on naval capabilities and created a measure of state naval strength for all countries from 1865 to 2011. As such, we are in a position to address the claims of the Romney campaign.Broadly stated, our measure of state naval power is based on a state’s total number of warships (non-fighting ships are excluded) and each ship’s available firepower. To make comparisons over time, our annual measure is based on available firepower within the international system in that year.  (For more information, see our paper here.)In 1916, the US controlled roughly 11% of the world’s naval power. This is an impressive number that ranks the US third in naval strength behind the UK(34%) and Germany (19%), and just ahead of France (10%). What about the US navy in 2011? In 2011, the US controlled roughly 50% of the world’s naval power putting it in a comfortable lead in naval power ahead of Russia (11%).The USNavy has decreased in absolute size as Governor Romney argues (although this decline has been ongoing since the end of Cold War). U.S. warships are more powerful now than in the past, as President Obama implied. However, neither the number of warships nor the power of our ships is what is most important for understanding military and political influence. It is relative military power that matters most. In this respect, the U.S. navy is far stronger now than in 1916.

see more posts by Sarah JonesWondering how we got here again, with Florida being a voters’ hell of anti-democracy and Ohio attaching non-certified “tabulators” to voting machines that Tagg Romney has a piece of?This is what happens when Democrats, young people and minorities sit out the midterms.In Florida during the 2008 election, 8.4 million people voted. In 2010, only 5.3 million voted. Margin of victory for Rick Scott? 1.2%. This in spite of the fact that voters knew that Rick Scott was the head of a company forced to pay the biggest fine in history for defrauding Medicare and other government programs. Reform? He is a Tea Party candidate. Only they would vote for a criminal and think it would work out well.In Ohio, Kasich was elected by 23.5 percent of registered voters and only won by 2%. His Democratic opponent, incumbent Gov. Ted Strickland, was winning in all of the early polls. Voters were allegedly unhappy with the economy and the state budget, and the race tightened.Remember when the Tea Party got everyone to think that the deficit was the reason to vote for people with criminal experience or a Fox News Channel host? Yes, Kasich had some experience in government in the House, but he had been a Fox News host for six years. Both probably should have been a clue that election time would be trouble under him.Nate Silver wrote about the “enthusiasm gap” that hurt Democrats in 2010. It was 8 points in Ohio and Wisconsin. That was enough to usher in Walker and Kasich, who have each done their best to destroy voters’ rights in their swing states.When you break down the data, minority and Democratic turnout fell in 2010. Having reliable turnout machines like Obama has plays a big role in getting voters to the polls. Nate Silver pointed that out in 2010, “What we’re probably seeing, then, is the “hangover” from the Mr. Obama’s turnout efforts in 2008. In states like Ohio and New Hampshire and Indiana, where Democrats registered tons of new voters and made sure that all of them got to the polls, a lot of them didn’t participate this time around.”Young voter turnout fell 60% from 2008 to 2010. “51 percent of 18- to-19-year-olds voted that year. In 2010, polls showed that young people were still supportive of Obama and the Democrats. But only 20.9 percent of them bothered to vote.”They didn’t vote because they were unhappy with congress and unenthused about the candidates, but guess what that got us? A much, much worse congress. When young people vote, they tend to vote Democratic. This is why Republican governors hired in 2010, when those same young people sat out the election, have been working so hard to disenfranchise young people (college students) from voting.I won’t get into how Democrats allowed themselves once again to buy into the Republican narratives against the change they sought. That is for another day, but it goes to show that morale is worth a lot. This is why Republicans work so hard to kill Democratic morale. It works.Many voters only think of showing up in presidential elections. Let’s hope that the widespread abuse of voting rights in 2012 will wake voters up to the necessity to vote in every single election, and be sure to fill out the entire ballot even though it’s a real chore. If you must, think of it like taking the trash out instead of thinking you’re going to get something great. It will pay off.

Early this month, a federal judge partially overturned Pennsylvania's voter ID law, ruling that the state couldn't require voters to show photo identification at the polls until after the 2012 election. But the ruling has not stopped the state from running ads suggesting otherwise—ads that have disproportionately targeted urban and minority communities that tend to vote for Democrats.In English, the billboard pictured above reads: "This election, if you've got it, show it." It is one of 58 billboards erected by Pennsylvania's Republican-led Department of State, mostly in Democratic-leaning Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Though Latinos make up only 6 percent of the state's population, about 20 percent of the billboards are in Spanish. Similar Spanish-language ads appear on public buses."The ad is really confusing and misleading," says Marian Schneider, the attorney with the Advancement Project who on October 2 convinced a judge to delay the state's voter ID law. At the same time, she failed to win an injunction against advertisements publicizing the law, but Schneider recently submitted a new brief asking the court to get involved. She believes the new ads "blur the message" and may dissuade people from voting if they do not have ID.Ron Ruman, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania's Department of State, denies that the advertisements are misleading. "In the primary all voters were asked for ID, and they will be again in November," he says, though he acknowledges that people will be allowed to cast regular ballots—ID or no ID. He explained that the department targeted urban locations to get the most bang for the buck, and because "there might be a larger number of people there who might not have a driver's license."Before the court overturned Pennsylvania's voter ID law, the state had already publicized it with TV ads, thousands of mailers, and numerous billboards and bus advertisements. In the weeks since, the state has taken down some of those ads. But one Spanish-language billboard saying, "If you want to vote, show it," remained up for many days. And the state has not sent out mailers to clarify the altered circumstances. Voting-rights advocates accuse state elections officials of sowing more confusion with the new billboards."What our groups are concerned about is that the billboards are not sending voters the message that the ID is not needed for this election," says Marcia Johnson-Blanco, codirector of the Voting Rights Project. Her group is fighting back with its own ads, which say that people without IDs can still vote this year.

A Pennsylvania electronic voting machine was taken out of service after being captured on video changing a vote for President Obama into one for Mitt Romney, NBC News has confirmed. Republicans have also said machines have turned Romney votes into Obama ones.The video was first posted on Youtube by user “centralpavoter.” It shows a voter’s finger repeatedly pressing the button for Obama, but a check mark coming up next to Romney’s name:NBC News confirmed that the machine has been taken off line.Underneath the video, the user gave an account of what happened:My wife and I went to the voting booths this morning before work. There were 4 older ladies running the show and 3 voting booths that are similar to a science fair project in how they fold up. They had an oval VOTE logo on top center and a cartridge slot on the left that the volunteers used to start your ballot. I initially selected Obama but Romney was highlighted. I assumed it was being picky so I deselected Romney and tried Obama again, this time more carefully, and still got Romney. Being a software developer, I immediately went into troubleshoot mode. I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney’s name and started tapping very closely together to find the ‘active areas’. From the top of Romney’s button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama’s name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein’s button was fine. All other buttons worked fine. I asked the voters on either side of me if they had any problems and they reported they did not. I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it. She him hawed for a bit then calmly said “It’s nothing to worry about, everything will be OK.” and went back to what she was doing. I then recorded this video. There is a lot of speculation that the footage is edited. I’m not a video guy, but if it’s possible to prove whether a video has been altered or not, I will GLADLY provide the raw footage to anyone who is willing to do so. The jumping frames are a result of the shitty camera app on my Android phone, nothing more.Separately, the RNC last week sent a letter (pdf) to elections officials in six other states, including Ohio, Nevada, and Colorado, raising concerns that machines had wrongly counted votes for Romney as ones for Obama, and asking them to address the problem.Late Update,2:35pm: A spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of State told Mother Jones a machine that showed that problem, likely the same one, is back online after being “recalibrated.”Late Late Update 4:33pm: Rich Gardella and Ellie Hall of NBC News have spoken to the voter who recorded the video. He told them he was eventually able to register his vote for Obama by finding the one area of the screen where the vote would be recorded. When he told the poll worker, she replied that there was therefore “no problem.”The voter, who asked to remain anonymous, also told Gardella and Hall that as a software developer, he’s offended that a company could allow a machine with such a flaw to be used for a presidential election. If he allowed a defect like that on programs he worked on, he’d be fired, the voter said.

Chris Kluwe, the now famous NFL Vikings punter whose support of marriage equality — which includes accusing a state lawmaker of worrying about turning into a “cockmonster” — took America by storm, is now up in arms and battling Ohio’s voter suppressing Secretary of State, Republican Jon Husted.Kluwe, by the way, just pulled his blog from his publisher, Pioneer Press, over their “neutral view of both sides of the marriage amendment,” the anti-gay marriage amendment facing Minnesota voters tomorrow.Via Twitter, Kluwe took Secretary Husted, who has done everything humanly possible to disrupt early voting in Ohio, to task.What Kluwe is referencing is this article in Salon, “Is the GOP stealing Ohio?,” which notes that “Uncertified, ‘experimental’ software patches have been installed on machines in 39 counties of the key swing state.”Some frightening excerpts from the Salon piece:If this sounds like cause for concern, it is.If you think Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted is someone worth your trust, just read this via Wikipedia:Husted announced on September 4th that the state would not comply with a court ruling and allow early voting during the final weekend before the election until an appellate court rules on the matter. “Announcing new hours before the court case reaches final resolution will only serve to confuse voters and conflict with the standard of uniformity,” Husted wrote in a memo. However, after he was summoned to appear before a federal judge who had struck down the policy change and questioned his failure to comply with the court order, Husted relented, thus allowing counties to plan for early voting.But I do know that voting is the only thing we can do right now.To not vote would be to admit defeat.We invite you to sign up for our new mailing list, and subscribe to The New Civil Rights Movement via email or RSS.Also, please like us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter!

Now that President Obama has been elected to a second term, political opponents of his landmark health care reform law are beginning to concede that Obamacare is here to stay. And the general public agrees.As a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll reports, the majority of Americans don’t support repealing Obamacare. In fact, after the presidential election, the number of Americans advocating for a full repeal of the health reform law dropped to an all-time low at just 33 percent — compared to nearly half of Americans who would rather keep the law in place:Last week, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) acknowledged that Obamacare is “the law of the land,” suggesting that Republicans in Congress may finally cease their repeated attempts to repeal the law. But his office quickly walked those statements back, clarifying that Republicans remain very committed to opposing Obama’s health reform.However, if Republican lawmakers continue to stand in opposition to Obamacare by undermining some of the health law’s key provisions, public opinion still isn’t on their side. Previous polling has shown that Americans tend to be broadly supportive of Obamacare’s individual provisions — such as allowing young adults to remain on their parents’ insurance plans, and preventing insurance companies from discriminating against Americans with pre-existing conditions — even if they remain unsure about what the entire law means for the country.The declining support for repealing the health law is a blow to the anti-Obamacare candidates who poured over $20 million into advertisements attacking the Affordable Care Act during the 2012 election cycle. On the other hand, at least six candidates in tight races across the country won last week after advocating for the health reform law throughout their campaigns.

Continuing our daily coverage of number guru Nate Silver’s 538 blog at the New York Times, we’re in the home stretch and Obama is certainly stretching his legs as he continues to put distance between himself and the Romney campaign. Ignore the breathless reporting on the national polls; that’s just an audience hungry media dying for attention in a race that has never shown Romney reaching 270 electoral votes even once.Up from 79.0% chance of winning and 300.4 electoral votes from 11/1. The percentage may go up but I think the electoral votes might be maxed out. Winning more than 303 votes seems improbable at this late date.Colorado: 65.7% Chance of an Obama win  (Up from 62.6%)Florida: 55.9% Romney  (Down from 58.8%) If this crosses over to even a slimObama lead by election day, Mitt better hope the GOP puts their electron fraud into high gear.New Hampshire: 78.7% Obama (Up from 75.2%)North Carolina: 81.1% Romney (Up from 80.8%) Look! Good news for Romney! Ohio: 80.7% Obama (Up from 79.9%) Look! Bad news for Romney!Virginia: 64.8% Obama (Significantly up from 61.3%) Virginia going to Obama is game over. Romney is going to have to rely on a lot of “irregularities” to carry the election.Wisconsin: 93.0% Obama (Down from 88.0%) I think Wisconsin just went from “swing state” to “Obama win.”There is talk among liberal pundits that if Obama wins the electoral college but Romney “wins” the popular vote, the GOP will use this as an excuse to “investigate” the election and declare Obama an illegitimate candidate. If they’re lucky, they can force it to go to the Supreme Court for a repeat of the 2000 “election.”Even if you live in a solid blue state like New York, your vote WILL count! Get out there and vote!

In the frenetic push to win all-important Ohio, Mitt Romney’s campaign is saying a lot of things to a lot of people. And on Monday, a top Romney surrogate told a group of Jewish voters in the Buckeye State that the landmark Supreme Court decision granting women the right to an abortion is in no danger of being overturned should Romney become president.“President Bush was president eight years, Roe v. Wade wasn’t reversed. He had two Supreme Court picks, Roe v. Wade wasn’t reversed,” former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) told a Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Beechwood, Ohio. “It’s not going to be reversed.”Video of Coleman’s remarks, captured by Quinn Bowman of FeatureStoryNews:Coleman is on the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group aimed at increasing the GOP share of the Jewish vote. Sheldon Adelson has been a major financial backer of the group. Coleman has also served as a top Romney surrogate and adviser, particularly on national security issues.His point about Roe v. Wade — made in response to a question “regarding what he would say to voters who are worried about the influence of religious conservatives on the Republican Party,” according to Bowman — may come as news to Romney’s supporters in the anti-abortion community, who see him as their opportunity to finally overturn the decision they see as a travesty.For his part, Romney has said overturning Roe is a personal goal.“My view is that the Supreme Court should reverse Roe v. Wade and send back to the states the responsibility for deciding whether it’s is legal or not,” Romney said at a candidate forum hosted by Mike Huckabee last year. On his campaign website, Romney calls Roe v. Wade “a case of blatant judicial activism.” In September, Romney promised to appoint justices “that will follow the law and the Constitution” when asked about Roe.At the same time, Romney tried to sound a similar tone to Coleman’s in the days after Todd Akin’s “legitimate rape” remark catapulted abortion rights to the forefront of the political debate. Abortion rights advocates dismissed it, pointing to his previous attacks on Roe and promise to pick justices that share his values.Asked about his comments by the AP, Coleman said he wasn’t speaking for Romney.

Lots of people having fun with Mitt Romney’s post-election diagnosis, which is that President Obama played dirty: he won peoples’ votes by — horrors — actually making their lives better:“With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest was a big gift,” Mr. Romney said. “Free contraceptives were very big with young, college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents’ plan, and that was a big gift to young people. They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008.” The president’s health care plan, he said, was also a useful tool in mobilizing black and Hispanic voters. Though Mr. Romney won the white vote with 59 percent, according to exit polls, minorities coalesced around the president in overwhelming numbers: 93 percent of blacks and 71 percent of Hispanics. “You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you’re now going to get free health care, particularly if you don’t have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family, in perpetuity — I mean, this is huge,” Mr. Romney said. “Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus. But in addition with regards to Hispanic voters, the amnesty for children of illegals, the so-called Dream Act kids, was a huge plus for that voting group.”Gosh. People who will have health insurance under Obama but would have lost it under Romney voted for Obama. What’s wrong with those people?But as many commentators have pointed out, Romney was just encapsulating the prevalent worldview on the right. Some of us see an increasingly, radically unequal America, with rising inequality actually reinforced by public policy, with tax rates on the rich lower than they have been in many decades and the overall redistributive effect of government down substantially since the 1970s. But the right sees an entitlement epidemic, in which the big problem is that too many people are getting free stuff.It’s important to understand the roots of this stuff. It began as a deliberate appeal to racism, with explicit condemnation of Those People as welfare moochers. Then it became more coded; Rick Perlstein posts the original, famous Lee Atwater interview containing the memorable passage,You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”What Mitt Romney is now complaining about is the horrifying reality that many people who aren’t black see themselves as victims of those “economic things” — and as a result anti-government rhetoric is turning into a way to lose elections rather than win them.And I don’t think the Republican party as currently constituted can change this: after 45 years of the Southern strategy, this stuff is what defines the party’s soul.

But...stick to the movies! There is an implication here that I have been assigned a role and must perform it. I was writing about politics before I ever wrote a movie review. I've done op-eds for The Sun-Times since time immemorial. Some people are under the impression that I've become sidetracked in the last ten minutes.There may be a larger implication, that most people are not qualified to hold political opinions. It's said to be impolite to bring up religion or politics at dinner. That means many meals go without any discussion of what we believe or why we believe it. That's not the way I was raised. Politics were always discussed at our family dinners, and in my memories of long-ago Thanksgivings, after the table had been cleared at my grandmother's house my dad and Uncle Everett and Uncle Johnny all repaired to the living room, fired up their Luckies and Camels, and started in about Eisenhower and Stevenson, Nixon and Kennedy.There was never any anger. What I remember is good-natured laughter. My Uncle Everett, a Republican, had a way of following a punch-line by lighting a fresh smoke and puffing emphatically. It was a form of punctuation. Then my dad: "Everett, the trouble with you is..." Uncle John was considered a political miracle, because in a state, county, city and Congressional district controlled by Republicans, he was a Democrat and yet had been appointed Champaign postmaster, which was a patronage job. "Everybody likes John," people would say.I don't recall the words "liberal" and "conservative." People in Downstate Illinois thought in terms of party, not ideology. By writing The Conscience of a Conservative, Barry Goldwater unleashed a word into the common vocabulary and people began to identify with it and its opposite. Both are ancient terms much honored by their roots in British partisan politics, neither until recently a term of reprobation.I am a liberal. I've never made it a secret. On my blog, some comments describe me as a "typical liberal" so frequently I begin to suspect that word processing programs have been modified to insert the word "typical" in front of "liberal" in all usages not actually part of a recipe.Nobody is a typical anything. We are all atypically ourselves. By demonizing those who disagree, we bring the conversation to a halt. Words like "socialism" are also not helpful. I wonder if the reader who recommended I move to Europe has any idea that perfectly respectable people can be socialists. In a national poll, Canada recently selected a man named Tommy Douglas as the greatest Canadian, and he was a socialist, but that wasn't the reason for his popularity. He was also a Baptist minister. As premier of Saskatchewan, he introduced universal health care to that nation. But don't get me started. Canadians in general think of him as a great man. He may even qualify as a "typical liberal."I saw an article the other day saying that most Americans don't much follow politics. That is a tragedy. Democracy is like a lot of things: If you don't use it, you lose it. I suspect that many Americans who are absolutely positive who they will vote for in the next election would not be particularly articulate in explaining why. This is partly the fault of the superficial nature of our media, where idiocy rules television. You can more easily find the reasons why viewers support the competitors on the dominant television genre. (That genre, of course, was founded decades ago as "The Original Amateur Hour," although its descendants are neither original or amateurs.)So anyway, yes, I make bold to write about politics. I am proud of the calibre of the comments, both with me and against me, that this blog draws. I would feel diminished if I had to write only about movies. Or let me be more precise: If you give it some thought, to have a license to write about movies is to be licensed to write about anything. "All politics is local," said Tip O'Neill. To which I append: "All movies is political."

Efraim Halevy, former chief of Israel’s spy agency the Mossad, said in two separate interviews on Sunday and Monday that President Obama’s approach toward Iran has been “courageous” and “brave.” Halevy told Al-Monitor that: “Obama does think there is still room for negotiations. It’s a very courageous thing to say in this atmosphere.” Halevy contrasted the approach with Mitt Romney’s:HALEVY: Negotiating with Iran is perceived as a sign of beginning to forsake Israel. That is where I think the basic difference is between Romney and Obama. What Romney is doing is mortally destroying any chance of a resolution without war. Therefore when [he recently] said, he doesn’t think there should be a war with Iran, this does not ring true. It is not consistent with other things he has said.Halevy also acknowledged the impact of recent sanctions. During a conversation on Israeli radio on Monday, the former spy chief attributed Iran’s recent economic problems to the sanctions passed by the Obama administration. He told Al-Monitor: “The sanctions have been very effective. They are beginning to really hurt.” These comments reinforce a speech that Halevy delivered at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. last Thursday, where he said: “The fact of the matter is the sanctions have not brought the end to the program but sanctions are hurting very much.” Ehud Barak, Israel’s defense minister, has also said that sanctions against Iran have been “effective.” Halevy’s statements undermine the Romney campaign’s claim that President Obama’s handling of the Iran issue has been ineffective and that Romney would be better at the “negotiating table.”Halevy himself urged negotiations, saying to Al-Monitor: “I realized that dialogue with an enemy is essential. There is nothing to lose. Although the claim was, if you talk to them, you legitimize them. But by not talking to them, you don’t de-legitimate them. So this convinced me, that we all have been very superficial in dealing with our enemies. Not everything you try succeeds. But you have to be willing to try.” His comments come on the heels of a New York Times report that Iran and the U.S. have agreed “in principle” to direct negotiations with each other. When Romney was asked if he supported such an approach, he refused to answer.Responding to the report, Moshe Ya’alon, Israel’s strategic affairs minister, said that Israel would support direct negotiations if they could halt the nuclear program in Iran.The Obama administration, along with its European allies, believe that an Iran with a nuclear weapon is a threat and have implemented several rounds of crippling sanctions aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. The sanctions have resulted in an estimated loss of $48 billion a year in Iranian oil revenues. U.S., Israeli and U.N. officials have repeatedly pointed out that Iran has not yet decided to pursue a nuclear weapon.

Less than one week away from the election, a terrifying new poll reveals that more than two-thirds of registered Republican voters believe that people can be possessed by demons.A staggering 68 percent of registered Republican voters stated that they believe demonic possession is real. Meanwhile, only 48 percent of self-identified Republicans believe in another equally if not more scary natural phenomenon: climate change.The poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, touted by NPR as “one of the most prolific polling outfits in the country.”The survey was filled with enlightening gems about how the supernatural world may affect the upcoming presidential race. Women were slightly more likely than men to believe in demonic possession, although this gender gap is not nearly as wide as that of women’s preference for Obama.In a classic example of cognitive dissonance, only 37 percent of registered voters–both Democrat and Republican–believe in ghosts, although 57 percent believe in demonic possession. This raises the question, which was ignored in the presidential debates along with other essential issues like climate change and the educational system, about what the possessing force would actually be. (Perhaps Karl Rove?)For registered Republicans who do believe in demonic possession (which is, again, the majority), there is at least one standout elected official who is taking this issue seriously and has educated himself about spiritual exorcism.Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has written a first-hand account about witnessing an exorcism while he was in college.“Kneeling on the ground, my friends were chanting, ‘Satan, I command you to leave this woman.’ Others exhorted all ‘demons to leave in the name of Christ,’”Jindal wrote.Jindal made presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s short list for VP picks–but, according to the Associated Press, this story of exorcism was a strike against the governor. (The Public Policy Poll hadn’t come out yet.) Delaware Senate candidate Christine O’Donnell also has considerable knowledge of witchcraft, although this expertise didn’t win her the race in 2010. “I dabbled into witchcraft — I never joined a coven,” she said to ABC . “But I did, I did. I dabbled into witchcraft. I hung around people who were doing these things. I’m not making this stuff up. I know what they told me they do,” she said. “One of my first dates with a witch was on a satanic altar, and I didn’t know it. I mean, there’s little blood there and stuff like that,” she said. “We went to a movie and then had a midnight picnic on a satanic altar.” The poll also revealed that zombies are considered to be the scariest monster, another issue that has not been raised at all on the campaign trail. Whether the two candidates will address these issues within the last week of the race remains to be seen.

Walmart really doesn't want organizers talking to its workers as actions against the retail giant heat up in advance of Black Thursday. That's no surprise, of course, but still, lying to police to get them to handcuff a former Walmart worker in the store to talk to current workers is a little much.Josh Eidelson reports that Alex Rivera worked at an Orlando Walmart store until September, when he was on the receiving end of one of those coincidental firings we see so often when workers become activists, with Walmart changing his workload and checking up on him constantly, then firing him for the common practice of correcting his time sheet to account for time he spent helping customers while officially off the clock. Since his firing, Rivera had returned repeatedly to talk to his former coworkers about taking part in Black Friday strikes and protests, which is something that's going to get you kicked out of Walmart in a hurry. This was different, though:According to Rivera and an OUR Walmart organizer who accompanied him to the store, Rivera was leaning over to drink from a water fountain when a police officer grabbed his arm without warning, put him in handcuffs and led him to an office. Rivera said that the officer told him that Walmart management had informed the police that Rivera had previously signed a written trespassing warning obligating him not to return to the premises. Walmart “lied to the police officer.…” said Rivera. “That’s why they handcuffed me.” Rivera added that when the store’s “asset protection” manager suggested additional details for the officer to add to the police report, “The police officer told him three times. He said no, I’m not going to add that stuff.” Rivera said that after discovering that the police department had no trespassing warning on file for him, the officer asked the store’s co-manager to produce a copy of it. At that point, according to Rivera, the co-manager backtracked, and the police officer “started making faces” at the manager, and quickly released Rivera’s handcuffs. Rivera and the OUR Walmart organizer said that the officer issued them a trespassing warning against returning to the store, but told them that he never would have handcuffed Rivera if he hadn’t been told incorrectly that he had already violated such a signed warning.As a union organizer, you expect to get kicked out of anti-union stores like Walmart. But, as Rivera told , this wasn't so much about getting him out of the store as intimidating current workers: "They’re going to say, 'If I join the organization and do something like that, this is what’s going to happen to me.'" Intimidation and retaliation are exactly how Walmart keeps its poorly paid, discriminated-against workers from organizing. And that's just one of the reasons it's so important to keep fighting the Walmart economy.

Right-wing media figures are trying to change the focus from Mitt Romney's deceptive debate comments on the size of the U.S. Navy by distorting President Obama's statements on the changing nature of the military. During the October 22 presidential debate, Mitt Romney once again invoked the misguided talking point that under Obama, "our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917." In response, Obama quipped that "we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military's changed." Right-wing media figures are responding to this self-evidently true statement by pretending that Obama said that the military no longer uses any bayonets or horses at all.Immediately following the debate, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace highlighted that a Marine "tweeted Fox News and said the Marines still use bayonets. So it may not be clear who doesn't understand what the military currently uses." Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin complained that "Mr. Snarky Commander McSnark" was "lecturing Romney on how we don't have bayonets anymore." At Breitbart.com, Joel Pollak also purported to fact-check Obama, writing that "the military still uses bayonets."But these conservatives are putting words in Obama's mouth. The president never said the military doesn't use any horses or bayonets, just that they use fewer of them.Indeed, a 2011 article in military newspaper Stars and Stripes (which is a Department of Defense authorized news outlet), highlighted the changing role of the bayonet in the military. The article explained that there hasn't been a bayonet charge since the Korean War and that "U.S. army units have not issued soldiers bayonets to Iraq and Afghanistan." (Nonetheless, the article noted that soldiers would still be trained to use a bayonet, just in a different capacity.)In 2010, Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, then the Training and Doctrine's deputy commanding general for Initial Military Training, explained the need for evolving bayonet training because it was "kind of hard to teach right now when most of the weapons we use don't have the ability to affix a bayonet."The fact that our military is currently more reliant on things like helicopters and tanks as opposed to horses should be self-evident.But all of the focus on Obama's invocation of bayonets and horses misses the larger point entirely, which is that Romney's assertion that the Navy is the smallest it's been since 1917 is outrageously misleading. A Washington Post fact check of Romney when he made this claim early in October labeled the attack "a nonsense fact" because "Romney equates gunboats with aircraft carriers and torpedo boats with nuclear-powered submarines."

There’s a disturbing irony within the food industry: Many of its employees rely on food stamps.The food sector accounts for 13% of our nation’s gross domestic product, collectively selling $1.8 trillion in goods and services. It employs about 20 million workers, or about one in five of all Americans working in the private sector.(MORE: How to Go to the Movies for $1 This Summer)But even though we rely so much on the industry – it provides us the very substance that keeps us alive, after all – we’re barely (and sometimes not) paying its workers a living wage.According to a new report by the Food Chain Workers Alliance, only 13.5% of food industry workers earn livable wages. The median wage is $9.65 an hour, and 86% of workers are earning either subminimum, poverty or low wages.Due to such depressed earnings, many food industry employees also struggle to just to eat, creating a rather depressing irony that those who feed us can barely feed themselves. Almost 14% of them rely on food stamps compared with 8.3% in all other industries. For the study, the organization interviewed 700 workers and employees in the five main sectors in food service: production, processing, distribution, retail and service.It’s not just poor wages that food industry workers have to deal with. Most (83%) also don’t have health insurance and, as a result, many (35%) rely on emergency rooms for treatment when they get sick. And not having insurance may actually be harming those who rely on the industry employees. More than half of food industry workers say they have worked when they’re sick, largely because they either don’t have paid sick days or don’t even know that they do (79%).Just as troubling, many of them (40%) work more than 40 hours a week and a third say they don’t always receive lunch breaks.The future for many in the industry doesn’t look much brighter. Few food industry employees get on-the-job training that could help them find a better job or move up the ladder. Three-quarters of those surveyed say there is no ongoing training by their employer and about the same number say they have never had an opportunity to apply for a better job. More than 80% have never received a promotion.The organization that conducted the study suggests a few ways to fix the situation, such as increasing the minimum wage and forcing employers to guarantee workers’ health benefits. But that sort of legislation doesn’t look to be imminent on the national level. The sad irony inside the food industry is only likely to persist.

Obama has been pressing to let the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of the year for the wealthiest 2 percent of the nation’s households, a tax hike adamantly opposed by Republicans. But Carney suggested that even the revenue generated by letting those tax cuts end would not be enough to tame the national debt and reenergize the economy.Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other senior Democrats on Tuesday said Obama would not be willing to maintain the Bush tax rates in exchange for a cap on deductions for households earning more than $250,000 a year, a leading Republican alternative.“I don’t see how you do this without higher rates. I don’t think there’s any feasible, realistic way to do it,” Geithner said at a conference in Washington. “When you take a cold, hard look at the amount of resources you can raise from that top 2 percent of Americans through limiting deductions, you will find yourself disappointed relative to the magnitude of the revenue increases that we need.”Democrats said Obama is likely to maintain a tough stance Friday, when Boehner and other congressional leaders are due to gather at the White House for their first face-to-face discussions about how to avoid the fiscal cliff. Fresh off a resounding electoral victory in which they kept the White House and picked up seats in the House and Senate, Democrats said there is no reason to compromise now on a central plank of the president’s platform. “It was an intrinsic part of his campaign, and the public supports it. So what more do you want?” said Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), the senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. Although Republicans have offered fresh revenue in a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, they have not proposed a specific target. Boehner suggested that negotiations resume on terms discussed in 2011, when he offered to raise $800 billion over the next decade through a rewrite of the tax code. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) endorsed that general idea Tuesday but warned Obama not to overplay his hand, noting that the president’s $1.6 trillion tax request failed to receive a single vote in Congress in the spring.“We’re calling on him to lead, to take the initiative, propose a plan that’s actually designed to succeed,” McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. “I’m not asking the president .?.?. to adopt our principles. I’m simply asking him to respect our principles by not insisting that we compromise them. Because we won’t.”

Last month, James Bopp, the legal mind behind the Citizens Unitedcase that gave rise to super-PACs and the dark-money boom, told me he didn't really believe Americans were all that upset with the increasing amounts of money spent on politics. "There's a general cynicism among the American people about politicians and politics," he said, but "they could care less about campaign finance."Now that the election's over, Bopp says he's been vindicated. When I caught up with him late last week, he told me he figures that Mitt Romney's loss was probably due to a variety of factors like poor messaging and spending. Without Citizens United, though, he says the election would have turned out much worse for Republicans: There would have been no counterbalance to the mainstream media. "The lesson here is all the hype over independent spending was just completely overblown," Bopp says. "Nobody can buy an election."The poor return on investment among the biggest conservative outside spending groups would appear to back that up. You can only spend so much to sway voters, says Bopp. "There's a diminishing returns as you saturate a market. Once you've got your message across, the addtional spending accomplishes nothing." The pro-Romney super-PAC Restore Our Future, for instance, made significant ad buys just one week out from the election in Minnesota and New Mexico, two states that Obama was at no risk of losing. Those moves led reporters to wonder if outside groups had raised more money than they knew what to do with. "That's why this thing about buying elections is fundamentally false," Bopp concludes.The $6 billion in total spending in 2012 dwarfs that of any recent election, but Bopp simply attributes that to an increasingly bloated system that requires increasing amounts of money to compete against incumbents.Bopp says the election was "fought to a draw," and "neither side accomplished what they set out to do." The county still has the same president, Republicans still have control of the House, and Democrats still lack a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. As for Obama's consideration of a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, Bopp hopes he pursues it. He's confident that Republicans at the national and state level could block any serious efforts to undo the decision, especially with Republican supporters of the now-defunct McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill like Richard Lugar and Olympia Snowe departing the Senate."I hope [Democrats] spend all their time on that," Bopp says, "because it's not going anywhere."

On Saturday, the published its endorsement of President Obama, saying that his steady leadership had earned him another four years in office. On Monday night, after the third and final presidential debate, the paper's editorial board published yet another endorsement of the incumbent:That of his opponent, Mitt Romney.Editorial A viewer who hadn't tuned into the campaign between Romney and Obama before Monday night's debate might have wondered what all the shouting was about. Monday's presidential debate, the third and last between President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney, featured a forceful and articulate defense of Obama's foreign policy. That was no surprise. What was surprising was that it came from Romney. That seemed to annoy the president — who was prepared to rebut his opponent's previous, more bellicose pronouncements. But the ever-shifting Republican nominee tacked even closer to the moderate middle than he did in the debate devoted to economic policy.The fact that President Obama dominated Romney in their foreign policy debate is clear . The president not only got in his fair share of zingers (horses, bayonets and submarines come to mind), but was also confident in his ability to argue the success of his foreign policy priorities and how they tied into the need to nation-build here at home. If Romney had a message, it was tough to discern exactly what it was, and his tone was hesitant and insecure. But what may hurt Romney even more than the overall tone and tenor of the debate? The amount of time he spent agreeing with President Obama's foreign policy vision.As much as Democrats were distraught by Obama's desire to find common ground with his opponent during the first debate, Romney's desire to do the same with what their alternate reality views as a weak, apologetic and anti-Israel foreign policy must have been even more painful for conservatives. Democrats support the president because we actually like him. Conservatives, on the other hand, are behind Romney not because they really like him, but because they despise Obama and will do whatever it takes to get rid of him, even if it means reconciling themselves to someone who will do anything to get elected.Unfortunately for Romney, this situation put him in a bind that he did not face during the debates that centered around domestic policy. When discussing the economy during the first two debates, Romney was able to (mendaciously) attack President Obama's record constantly, though his success depended entirely on the vigor with which Obama called him out on it. In a foreign policy debate, however, Romney's options were far more limited: in order to appear more moderate, he had to run away from his previous bellicosity and agree with the overall objective of peace. Unfortunately for him, President Obama's foreign policy has been exemplary in this regard, and this forced Romney into two options that were equally unpalatable from a political point of view: repudiate Obama's peace dividend and take an avowedly neoconservative approach to foreign policy, likely upsetting women and moderate voters in the process; or agree with the president, and face the prospect of upsetting his base in order to appeal better to the people who either haven't made up their minds, or are still liable to change them.In the end, though, Romney got the worst of all worlds on Monday night: he made his base unhappy, got rebuked by the president for his lack of knowledge and inconsistency, and looked incoherent and insecure in the process.

Did Gallup just blame Nate Silver for ruining the art and science of polling?You don’t have to read too far between the lines of a statement from Gallup’s editor in chief, Frank Newport, published on Friday, to get that impression.Newport first attempts the formidable task of defending Gallup’s polling accuracy during the 2012 campaign. Perhaps he was anticipating Silver’s Saturday column, which labeled Gallup the most inaccurate pollster of all the firms that measured voter sentiment this year. But Silver was hardly alone in wondering why Gallup regularly reported numbers much more favorable to Romney than anyone else in 2012. We deserve an explanation a little less lame than Newport’s: what’s the big fuss? Gallup wasn’t really off by that much.But then it gets interesting:But some of this will result from a variant of the venerable “law of the commons.” Individual farmers can each made a perfectly rational decision to graze their cows on the town commons. But all of these rational decisions together mean that the commons became overgrazed and, in the end, there is no grass left for any cow to graze. Many individual rational decisions can end up in a collective mess. We have a reverse law of the commons with polls. It’s not easy nor cheap to conduct traditional random sample polls. It’s much easier, cheaper, and mostly less risky to focus on aggregating and analyzing others’ polls. Organizations that traditionally go to the expense and effort to conduct individual polls could, in theory, decide to put their efforts into aggregation and statistical analyses of other people’s polls in the next election cycle and cut out their own polling. If many organizations make this seemingly rational decision, we could quickly be in a situation in which there are fewer and fewer polls left to aggregate and put into statistical models. Many individual rational decisions could result in a loss for the collective interest of those interested in public opinion. This will develop into a significant issue for the industry going forward.It is impossible to read this as anything other than an attack on Nate Silver, who is by far the most prominent aggregator and analyzer of others’ polls currently operating today. And it simply reeks of sour grapes. During the campaign year, Silver consistently pointed out that Gallup’s results were oddly inconsistent with what other pollsters were finding. And he was right — Gallup got it wrong. It is not inappropriate to point that out. But Gallup presumes too much when it effectively threatens to take its surveys home and just stop playing. OK, Nate Silver didn’t pick up the phone and call voters himself. And yes, it’s true, if all the polling organizations stop polling, Nate Silver will be out of a job. He might have to go back to crunching baseball stats. But he’s a smart guy, with an impressive track record. He’ll do fine. It seems foolish to blame him for crunching data that is publicly available for anyone to crunch. If he wasn’t good at what he does, he’d still be another anonymous poster hanging around the DailyKos forums. He’s been rewarded for getting things right. Gallup faces a more unhappy future. If the company keeps getting the numbers wrong, the market will punish it. At that point, Gallup won’t be able to blame its sorry fate on anyone but its own incompetence.

A let­ter re­ceived from a con­ser­va­tive or­ga­ni­za­tion by a Toledo woman is vaguely in­tim­i­dat­ing, but Da­nielle “Embyr” Lind­ner is not sure why."I’m not sure if they’re try­ing to en­cour­age me to vote, or not to vote, but I’m con­cerned that my neigh­bors are get­ting the same let­ters. I don’t want them to know I do vote. It’s re­ally no­body’s busi­ness,” said Ms. Lind­ner, 24, of Toledo, a med­i­cal bill­ing as­sis­tant.The let­ter from Amer­i­cans for Lim­ited Govern­ment pur­ports to be a Vote His­tory Au­dit. It thanks her for vot­ing and shows her vot­ing his­tory, show­ing that she voted in 2004 and 2008. It even has a “Notice Num­ber”: 47494705, the mean­ing of which is not ex­plained.It also shows the vot­ing his­tory of six oth­ers who live on her street, Ber­dan Avenue, in­clud­ing that of her grand­mother, Pa­tri­cia Lind­ner, who shares the same ad­dress.And, as if Ms. Lind­ner had asked to be kept ap­prised of her vot­ing his­tory, it says, “As a fur­ther ser­vice, we will be up­dat­ing our records af­ter the ex­pected high turn­out for the Tues­day, No­vem­ber, 6, 2012 elec­tion. We will then send an up­dated vote his­tory au­dit to you and your neigh­bors with the re­sults.”Its con­clu­sion in­forms Ms. Lind­ner: “Please be sure to con­tinue your par­tic­i­pa­tion and ex­er­cise your right and re­spon­si­bil­ity to vote.”Univer­sity of Toledo po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor David Wil­son, who heard about the let­ter through Ms. Lind­ner's grand­mother, said, “It seems to me to be a clear at­tempt at voter in­tim­i­da­tion, and thus vote sup­pres­sion.”He the­o­rized the in­tent of the let­ter is to make young vot­ers think twice about par­tic­i­pat­ing if it means in­for­ma­tion about them is be­ing com­mu­ni­cated to their neigh­bors.Mr. Wil­son said the let­ter might have tar­geted Ms. Lind­ner for her youth and as­sumed that she would be an Obama sup­porter.“I think at least some of the re­cip­i­ents will be wor­ried about this,” Mr. Wil­son said. “If I’m a lit­tle con­cerned about this, might this make me think twice about vot­ing?”Iron­i­cally, Ms. Linder leans Lib­er­tar­ian, which is a con­ser­va­tive phi­los­o­phy, and plans to vote for a third-party can­di­date.“I can’t rec­on­cile my so­cial be­liefs by vot­ing Re­pub­li­can and I can’t rec­on­cile my eco­nomic be­liefs by vot­ing Dem­o­crat,” she said.The vot­ing in­for­ma­tion is pub­licly avail­able through the Lu­cas County Board of Elec­tions, and is the type of in­for­ma­tion po­lit­i­cal cam­paigns rou­tinely ob­tain to make cam­paign de­ci­sions, such as whether a voter votes fre­quently or has pulled a Demo­cratic or Re­pub­li­can bal­lot in the past.The let­ter was signed by Wil­liam A. Wal­ter, the pres­i­dent of Amer­i­cans for Lim­ited Govern­ment. The group’s Web site pro­vides tele­phone num­bers and email ad­dresses, but calls and emails from The Blade to the or­ga­ni­za­tion on Wed­nes­day were not re­turned.The group is ac­tive in con­ser­va­tive is­sues. Its Web site lists more than 700 news re­leases com­ment­ing on po­lit­i­cal is­sues from a con­ser­va­tive an­gle over the last four years. It has also spent money to sup­port and op­pose can­di­dates, in­clud­ing two Demo­cratic Con­gres­sio­nal in­cum­bents from Ohio in 2010.The let­ter has popped up in other states. The Sec­re­tary of State of In­di­ana is­sued a state­ment urg­ing vot­ers to dis­re­gard let­ters claim­ing to be an au­dit of vot­ing ac­tiv­ity.Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

The question before presidential voters is simple: Who will better serve this country for the next four years, Mitt Romney or Barack Obama? When couched in straightforward terms, the answer is clear: President Obama should be re-elected.Obama has done a reasonably good job handling an almost unprecedented economic mess ? a situation that has proved far worse than anyone knew as it developed. Still, there is room for debate about the direction the country is headed.Romney has publicly demonstrated no core convictions beyond his obvious belief that he should be president. He apparently thinks that simply not being Obama is qualification enough.When Barack Obama took office, the country was mired in two wars, one pointless and neither properly funded. The economy was tanking and jobs were disappearing by the thousands. The automotive industry was on the verge of collapse ? threatening to take with it the entire upper Midwest. And, while no one knew it at the time, the Middle East was about to explode into chaos and confusion.On balance, Obama?s handling of all that has been good. U.S. forces have left Iraq and the end is in sight in Afghanistan. Muammar Gadhafi was ousted with no American troops involved. Democracy has a tenuous but real toehold in some Arab countries. And while the U.S. economy is recovering too slowly, it is recovering. As Vice President Joe Biden put it, Osama bin Laden is dead and GM is alive.Mitt Romney, however, has not effectively offered one. Instead, this race has been presented as a referendum on the economy and the president?s personal style. Romney has failed to explain himself or his agenda, and the voters still do not really know who he is or how he would govern.By all accounts, Romney?s Mormon faith is central to who he is. To listen to him campaign, however, one would never know that. His business acumen is touted as his core competence, but he will not release his tax records for more than a couple of years. He promises to cut taxes, increase defense spending, lower the deficit and make the seemingly impossible math work out by reforming the tax code. But he cannot, or will not, explain what those tax changes might be.Romney rails against Obamacare, although it was modeled on the program he enacted as governor of Massachusetts. He governed that state as a moderate, but won the presidential nomination describing himself as ?severely conservative.?He has gone from supporting reproductive rights when running for the Senate in 1994 to saying in 2007 that he would gladly ban abortion in all cases. He now says he would allow exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother.Romney has shown some consistency on other women?s health issues. He has repeatedly said he would strip Planned Parenthood of all funding and allow employers to exclude contraception from health-insurance coverage. He wants to talk about the economy but fails to understand that reproductive autonomy is an economic issue for women.Barack Obama is an imperfect president, of course, and to what extent he can achieve his goals for the nation remains to be seen. But he has and can articulate a vision for a better, fairer, more successful America. His opponent offers nothing of the sort.

You know, it is never a good time when the President is super concerned about the biggest social media website’s privacy policies. Why would that be the case? It happens so that Obama is worried about Facebook privacy because he thinks that it is not a safe place for his 14 year old daughter, Malia, to be online.During an interview with MTV last Friday, the President poured some hints, which elaborated the fact that apart from his daughter, Malia, Facebook is not a perfect haven for minors – Not a good platform for kids to hang out, to find love, or to chit chat with strangers.Among several factors, such as drive outs, dating and social media networking, the President represented the latter as a threat to Malia’s privacy. Obama said, “I’d worry about Facebook at the moment. I know the folks at Facebook. Obviously they have revolutionized the social network. However, Malia is well known and I am very keen on protecting her online privacy.”Moving on, Malia does not have her own Facebook fan page or such thing. This alludes to the fact that her online privacy is not going to be compromised. The President’s wife said last year that even if her husband was not a president or a famous person, she’d still be concerned about her kids hanging out in Facebook’s “weird” corridors.All of these concerns from the President and many other people highlight the fact that Facebook, alongside many other social media websites, comes with a lot of risks. Chatty minors, who usually like to befriend others at a moment’s whim, don’t generally pay attention to who might be sitting at the other end of the computer.On the subject of dating, Obama said that it is fine with him as long as his daughters are being protected by Secret Services. Of course, any guy seeing a bunch of gun ‘n earphone slinging bodyguards, will tend to behave a bit more than usual. The President is hopeful that boys who respect her daughters’ worth and family values will date Malia and her sister.

On Tuesday night, with a minute to go until the polls closed in the battleground state of Virginia, the MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews received word through their earpieces that the state was too close to call, according to the election analysts at MSNBC’s parent, NBC News.“I think that’s pretty significant,” Mr. Matthews said, optimistically, as a commercial break wrapped up. Virginia, a state that had voted to elect a Democratic presidential candidate only once in 40 years — Barack Obama in 2008 — was not leaning toward Mitt Romney as some Republicans had predicted it would.Inside the NBC “Sunday Night Football” studio that MSNBC was borrowing for the night, the stage manager loudly called out, “Here we go.” Ms. Maddow softly repeated, “Here we go,” and reported the news to three million viewers.When President Obama won Virginia and most of the other battleground states on Tuesday night, ensuring himself a second term as president, some at MSNBC felt as if they had won as well.During Mr. Obama’s first term, MSNBC underwent a metamorphosis from a CNN also-ran to the anti-Fox, and handily beat CNN in the ratings along the way. Now that it is known, at least to those who cannot get enough politics, as the nation’s liberal television network, the challenge in the next four years will be to capitalize on that identity.MSNBC, a unit of NBCUniversal, has a long way to go to overtake the Fox News Channel, a unit of News Corporation: on most nights this year, Fox had two million more viewers than MSNBC.But the two channels, which skew toward an audience that is 55 or older, are on average separated by fewer than 300,000 viewers in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that advertisers desire. On three nights in a row after the election last week, MSNBC — whose hosts reveled in Mr. Obama’s victory — had more viewers than Fox in that demographic.“We’re closer to Fox than we’ve ever been,” said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC, who has been trying to overtake Fox for years. “All of this is great for 2013, 2014 to keep building.”In some ways MSNBC, which until 2005 was partly owned by Microsoft, is where Fox was a decade ago — in the early stages of profiting from its popularity. The channel receives a per-subscriber fee of 30 cents a month from cable operators; CNN receives twice that, and Fox News at least three times as much.“When Microsoft was involved with MSNBC, it was viewed as kind of lacking in direction; I don’t think the channel had much leverage raising rates,” said Derek Baine, a senior analyst for SNL Kagan. “Maybe they will have some more leverage on this postelection.”If Fox sees itself as the voice of the opposition to the president, MSNBC sees itself as the voice of Mr. Obama’s America. Its story resembles that of so many other cable channels. It hit on a winning strategy (antiwar liberalism led by Keith Olbermann at 8 p.m.), added similar shows (like Ms. Maddow’s at 9 p.m., which became the channel’s tent pole when Mr. Olbermann left in 2011) and then sold its audience as something more: a community of passionate, like-minded people.Many progressives (and conservatives) now view the channel as a megaphone for liberal politicians, ideas and attacks against those who disagree. Such a megaphone — clearly marked, always on — has never existed before on television.It has all happened rather suddenly. During the presidential election in 2008, Ms. Maddow was so new that she was still getting lost in the labyrinth of Rockefeller Center. And MSNBC was so timid about applying a political point of view that it paired an NBC News anchor, David Gregory, with the outspoken Mr. Olbermann on election night. The awkward pairing symbolized the split in American journalism between those who embodied a political point of view and those who said they did not.

Editor's Note: Shannon K. O'Neil is  senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. This entry of Latin America's moment first appeared here. The views expressed are her own.As Americans went to the polls to elect their president last week, voters in Colorado and Washington chose to legalize marijuana (by referendum). Not only does this create conflicting state and federal laws, but it also directly challenges the United States’ war on drugs.These initiatives, Colorado’s Amendment 64 and Washington’s Initiative 502, directly conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug (along with heroin and LSD) – deemed to have “a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.” In 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder announced he would “vigorously enforce” federal laws if marijuana was legalized in California (it wasn’t). Although no official statement on Washington and Colorado has been released, the White House’s website maintains that “the Obama Administration has consistently reiterated its firm opposition to any form of drug legalization.”If these legalizations stand, it would mean big changes for the U.S. marijuana market. According to a 2010 RAND report, prices would drop dramatically. Consumption would also likely increase – the report estimates that for every 10 percent decrease in price, the number of consumers would rise by 3 percent.Legalization would also have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy, and especially for U.S.-Mexico relations. A recent Instituto Mexicano para la Competitividad A.C. (IMCO) report by Alejandro Hope and Eduardo Clark estimates that legalization in each statewould reduce cartels’ profits by 20 to 30 percent. This revenue drop would change the business models for many organized crime groups, especially those who rely more heavily on marijuana (such as the Sinaloa cartel). But these shifts don’t necessarily portend a decline in violence, especially if the marijuana business is replaced by stepped up robbery, kidnapping, and extortion.Even if the Colorado and Washington legalizations are delayed and/or ultimately struck down, they may change the conversation surrounding the international drug-control regime. The sitting presidents of Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala, along with many past presidents of Latin American countries have strongly questioned the current approach to drugs, and have asked for an international evaluation and studies through the OAS and the United Nations. If a groundswell in the United States does the same (at least for marijuana), the political pressure could perhaps spur the federal government to rethink its approach.

A Tea Party group in Kansas is saying that a Democratic candidate for the state House of Representatives should not be elected because he does not have children.Literature dropped off at homes in Wichita Saturday by Kansans for Liberty, a Tea Party group, says that Democrat Brandon Whipple should not be elected to the state House because he has no children. It is one of a list of reasons why Whipple, 30, should not be elected over Republican Rick Lindsey in the newly drawn district, according to the literature."Can someone with no children really understand your family's needs?" it reads, with "no children" written in red.Literature can be found here.Whipple denounced the literature as "extreme" and said his wife, Chelsea, takes an active role in the race. Kansans for Liberty does not fully understand his situation, he said. "It is a personal attack," Whipple told The Huffington Post. "It offends me because my wife and I are trying to have kids."Craig Gabel, the head of Kansans for Liberty, stands by the literature, saying that the perspective of a person changes when they have children and that is why the line was included. "If you have no experience in an area, it is hard for you to make informed decision in an area," Gabel said.Gabel said this includes parents wanting neighborhood schools and the ability to spank their children without fear of state officials. "Someone who does not have kids and does not sweat blood thinking they can't spank them -- if you don't have kids you don't understand that."Whipple's opponent, Lindsey, also does not have children, but the Tea Party has not campaigned against him because Lindsey is more in line with the party's principles, said Gabel.The piece also criticizes Whipple's experience as a public school teacher, calling him a career government employee, and attacks him for not having his name on the deed to his house. It calls the candidate's beliefs into question, saying Whipple told a neighborhood group that while he is a Democrat, he married into a Republican family and "learned to compromise."Whipple countered that while he has taught in the public schools, he has been teaching in private colleges since his unsuccessful 2010 state House race and that he placed his name on the house deed earlier this year. "It is filled with lies," Whipple said of the literature. "It is flat out lies."The no-children argument has been used several other times in political races. In Kansas in 2008, state Rep. Sean Gatewood (D-Topeka) was noted in literature for not having children at the time. In Westfield, N.J., in 2009, Democratic town Councilman Tom Bigosinski used the no-children issue against his Republican opponent Keith Loughlin during the pair's only debate. Bigosinski, who lost the race to Loughlin, later explained he wasn't trying to be derogatory, only pointing out an "important distinction.""There are profound differences between the two of us," Bigosinski, then 41, said in the debate against Loughlin, who was 31 at the time. "Unlike Keith, I'm a husband, I'm a father, I'm a homeowner and I'm a taxpayer and I have been for many years."The Whipple attack comes the same week that Kansas Republicans sent out a mailer in a Wichita state Senate district questioning why Democrat Keith Humphrey changed his last name from DeSoto when he was 11. Humphrey, a candidate for state Senate, changed his name after he was adopted by his stepfather. Whipple's district overlaps Humphrey's.Whipple said he believes Gabel and his group have moved the debate to a new level. "If you want to attack me for my personal stances on property taxes that's one thing," he said. "But an attack on not having kids takes it to a different level."What's happening in your district? The Huffington Post wants to know about all the campaign ads, mailers, robocalls, candidate appearances and other interesting campaign news happening by you.

Two years ago, Elizabeth Warren told David Corn that she'd rather stab herself in the eye than go back to Washington. On Tuesday, the Harvard Law professor and creator of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ate her words, knocking off Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass) in one of the most closely watched—and at times nastiest—races of the 2012 cycle. Warren's win isn't just a case of a Democrat winning in Massachusetts; perhaps no candidate, President Obama included, inspired as much enthusiasm from progressives across the country. (She raised more money than any other Senate challenger in the country, much of it from out of state.) NBC News called the race shortly after polls closed in Boston.Warren did it largely by sticking with what made her a political star in the first place—a fierce defense of the social contract, which led Republican to dub her "Matriarch of Mayhem" for her support of Occupy Wall Street:For Republicans, a what-might-have-been remains the campaign finance truce Warren and Brown agreed to, which barred outside groups from buying TV ad time in the Bay State (per the agreement, any independent expenditure would have to be offset with a chartiable donation from the campaign). Given the extent to which Republican outside groups outspent Democratic groups in 2012, that bargain almost certainly ended up working in Warren's favor. It also meant that the fiercest attacks on Warren's character—hitting her, for example, for identifying as Cherokee at Harvard—came from Brown himself, eroding his largely positive image in Massachusetts.For the 53-year-old Brown, this is likely not the end of his political career. With Sen. John Kerry rumored to be a top choice to replace retiring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, there's a possibility a new seat could open up as early as December. In that case, Brown would be a heavy favorite for the Republican nomination, and with a comparably weak Democratic bench in the state, stand a decent shot at getting his old job back. Alternatively, with Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick term-limited after 2014, he might just opt to try his luck closer to home.This post was originally published based on inaccurate reports that the race had been called for Warren. The race has since been called by CBS and NBC.

Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted now stands accused of ordering for "experimental software patches" to be installed on the vote-counting machines in a number of Ohio counties. According to the Columbus Free press, voting rights activists are concerned that the software patches, which are usually utilized to update or change existing software, could possibly affect over 4 million registered voters, including those in the state's most populated counties near Cleveland and Columbus.Under Ohio law, experimental use of voting equipment is permitted as long as it is restricted to a limited number of precincts. Under the experimental label, equipment can legally be used without certification.According to the Columbus Free Press, the contract between Husted's office and the vendor, Election Systems and Solutions, states that the software has not been and does not need to be reviewed by any testing authority at the state or federal level.A memo was sent out to personnel in the Secretary of State's office on Friday by election counsel Brandi Laser Seske detailing the software. In the memo, Seske explains that the software didn't require a review because it is not "involved in the tabulation or casting of ballots... or a modification to a certified system."A spokesman for the Secretary of State's office, Matt McClellan, said that no patches were installed. Instead, he described a reporting tool software that's meant to "assist counties and to help them simplify the process by which they report the results to our system." He said that this tool serves to cut down the amount of information that precinct workers would have to key in by hand by allowing the results to be output onto a thumbdrive and uploaded at once into the SoS's system. He said:When questioned why the reporting tool was labeled as "experimental", McClellan said:With just days until Election Day, the fear of voter suppression is only increasing. But McClellan insists that there shouldn't be any concerns that the reporting tool will jeopardize the voting results or voter information. Nevertheless, voting rights activists remain far from reassured.

No, you cannot have your country back. America is moving forward.That’s the message voters sent the Republican Party and its Tea Party wing Tuesday night when they re-elected President Obama and strengthened the Democrats’ control of the Senate.No amount of outside money or voter suppression or fear mongering or lying — and there was a ton of each — was enough to blunt that message.President Obama and his formidable campaign machine out-performed the Republicans, holding together a winning coalition that is the face of America’s tomorrow: young voters, urban voters, racially and ethnically diverse voters and women voters.According to exit polls, Obama won 60 percent of the 18 to 29 year old vote and 52 percent of the 30-40 vote. He won 69 percent of the vote in big cities and 58 percent of the vote in mid-sized cities. He won 93 percent of the black vote and more than 70 percent of both the Asian vote and the Hispanic vote. He won over half of the female vote. And he won 76 percent of the gay, lesbian and bisexual vote.Mitt Romney won the white vote, the male vote, the elderly vote, the small cities vote and the high-income vote.The base of Democratic support in this country is expanding. The Republican base is shrinking, becoming more racially homogenous, more rural and older.Reality made for a great rending of garments and gnashing of teeth among conservatives.O’Reilly continued: “The white establishment is now the minority.”Ann Coulter, who activates my gag reflex whenever I type her name, said Wednesday:Rush Limbaugh took to the air to say that “Mitt Romney and his family would have been the essence of exactly what this country needs” and that Romney “did offer a vision of traditional America.” Limbaugh went on:You would think that the world came to an end Tuesday night. And depending on your worldview, it might have. If your idea of America’s power structure is rooted in a 1950s or even a 1920s sensibility, here’s an update: that America is no more.Republicans are trying to hold back a storm surge of demographic change with a white picket fence. Good luck with that.

ARVADA, Colo. – Vice President Joe Biden reminded the crowd here Saturday to remember to set their clocks back, and joked that it's an act the Republican presidential candidate enjoys."Folks, I want to remind you: This is the end of Daylight Saving Time tonight," Biden said here at a midday rally in a high school auditorium. "It's Mitt Romney's favorite time of the year because he gets to turn the clock back.""He wants to turn back that clock so desperately -- this time he can really do it, tonight it happens," he added. "I'm going to get in trouble, but I tell you, man."Biden's joke came at the start of his third-to-last day of campaigning, which he is spending in Colorado before flying to Ohio for a three-rally day there Sunday.To a crowd of 900 in the Arvada West High School auditorium, Biden showed some enthusiasm about the waning days of the campaign. "I am so ready to win this election, man," he said. "If you have an absentee ballot here in Colorado and you haven't mailed it in yet, it's too late to mail it, so you need to carry it in .... Don't mail it, it ain't gonna get there. And we need you."The vice president was emotional early on in his speech, as he thanked the Vietnam veteran who introduced him, Steve Simmons, for serving."You're looking at a hero here, man," Biden said of Simmons, who had "Agent Orange rain down on him.""Because of guys like you, the president and I -- and everyone decided -- we're never again gonna do ... to veterans who fought for America what happened to Vietnam veterans," he said. "That's why I'm so proud to serve with the president."Biden also continued to criticize the Romney campaign's continued airing of an ad suggesting that the Obama adinistration's policies had forced Jeep manufacturing out of Ohio and to China. "There is one tweet I cannot repeat," he said, but "it was more than 'malarkey.'"He also described the ad as "callous," because "it preys on the fears of people who are just getting back on their feet."

During the campaign, Mitt Romney repeatedly promised seniors that he’d restore President Obama’s $716 billion in Medicare cuts. He promised them that, unlike Obama, he wouldn’t permit a single change to Medicare or Social Security for 10 years. He promised them, in other words, political immunity. While the rest of the country was trying to pay down the deficit and prioritize spending, they’d be safe.He also promised the rich that they’d see a lower overall tax rate, and while he did say he would try to pay for some of those tax cuts by closing loopholes and deductions, he also said he expected faster growth would pay for those cuts — which means he really was promising tax cuts to the rich at a time when he said deficit reduction should be a top priority. Oh, and let’s not forget his oft-stated intention to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and replace them with…something.Keep all that in mind when you hear Romney blaming his loss on “the gifts” that Obama reportedly handed out to “the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people.” Romney was free with the gifts, too, and his promises to seniors and to the rich carried a far higher price tag than any policies Obama promised minorities or the young. But to Romney, and perhaps to the donors he was speaking to, those policies didn’t count as “gifts.” They were…something else. Good ideas, maybe. Or the fulfillment of past promises. Or perhaps it wasn’t the policies that were different, but the people they were being promised to.The last time Romney’s comments to his donors leaked, he was telling them about the 47 percent of Americans who don’t pay taxes, refuse to take responsibility for their lives, and will support Obama come hell or high water. These new comments are continuous with those: Romney really does appear to believe that there’s a significant portion of the electorate that’s basically comprised of moochers. That’s Romney’s political cosmology: The Democrats bribe the moochers with health care and green cards. The Republicans try to free the makers through tax cuts and deregulation. Politics isn’t a conflict between two reasonable perspectives on how to best encourage growth and high-living standards. It’s a kind of reverse-Marxist clash between those who produce and those who take, and the easiest way to tell one from the other is to see who they vote for.When Romney thinks he’s behind closed doors and he’s just telling other people like him how politics really works, the picture he paints is so ugly as to be bordering on dystopic. It’s not just about class, but about worth, and legitimacy. His voters are worth something to the economy — they’re producers — and they respond to legitimate appeals about how to best manage the country. The Democrats’ voters are drags on the economy — moochers — and they respond to crass pay-offs. Romney doesn’t voice these opinions in public. He knows better. But so did the voters. That’s what you see in the overwhelming rejection Romney suffered among African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and young voters. They sensed that Romney fundamentally didn’t respect them and their role in the economy, and they were right.

In 2007, while running for the Republican nomination for president, Mitt Romney sat with conservative radio host Jan Mikelson of WHO-Iowa, and discussed many topics, including Mormonism. In this video, recorded off-air after the interview was over and while the station was in a commercial break, Romney became unhinged, defensive, and had a bit of an angry meltdown.Romney also remind us that he is 100% anti-choice, and would govern as such. As Governor, “I vetoed any bill that was in favor of choice,” Romney says.“I think I know my church better than you!,” Romney rants repeatedly. “Are you disagreeing with me? I understand my faith better than you do.”And then there’s Mitt’s famous, “Come on, I’m running for president” comment, which he is fond of telling people, especially when they supply him with undocumented workers.What’s compelling about this video is that Romney was fighting with Mikelson when the radio host was in agreement with him.  What’s also compelling about this video is that Romney – possibly in part because of this video — has all but refused to discuss his faith with reporters since.Also compelling, or unnerving, is that Romney talks about the end times, and the second coming of Christ:Christ appears, it’s throughout the Bible, Christ appears in Jerusalem, splits the Mount of Olives, to stop the war that’s coming in to kill all the Jews, it’s–our church believes that. That’s where the coming and glory of Christ occurs. We also believe that over the 1000 years that follows, the millennium, he will reign from two places, that the law will come forward from one place, from Missouri, the other will be in Jerusalem.It’s unnerving, to say the least.Also unnerving is what Mitt Romney inadvertently reveals about how he would govern. He says he’s never deviated from his religious beliefs when it comes to governing on abortion, he’s never made a “mistake” on abortion, but he’s made other “mistakes,” meaning, he’s deviated from the Bible’s teachings — and won’t do it again.Sarah Posner today at Religion Dispatches adds this interesting take on the video:The question that’s being raised now, as this video resurfaces and generates discussion, is: does Romney himself really believe this? Does he somehow revel in a “war that’s coming in to kill all the Jews,” or see it as inevitable? I think that’s not evident from the video, or from his answer to Stephanopoulos. (Of course Romney’s a notorious liar, so we may never know.) Romney’s very defensive in the video, under questioning by Mickelson who clearly is trying to get him to admit that Mormon end-times theology is wildly different from evangelical end-times theology (which has many variants, incidentally, but none that include Missouri as a locus for anything except the second coming of Todd Akin). But Romney appears to be suggesting that “our church believes that” rather than saying, “I believe this is a literal prophecy of how world events will play out.” I’ve written before about how Romney’s public pronouncements on the Israel-Palestine conflict are out of touch with non-apocalyptic, contemporary Mormon thinking, but still, he’s never discussed his own beliefs on the end-times, or disagreements, if any, with LDS doctrine. Apocalyptic beliefs are a Republican problem, though, not just a Romney problem; for example, George W. Bush, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann and Mike Huckabee are all evangelicals who forged relationships with apocalyptic preacher John Hagee. I would very much like to know whether they co-sign Hagee’s apocalyptic visions.We invite you to sign up for our new mailing list, and subscribe to The New Civil Rights Movement via email or RSS.Also, please like us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter!

In Princeton, we’re making sure we have bottled water and other supplies. It’s not clear how serious Hurricane Sandy will be. But we are grateful for the advance warning that is made possible by the National Weather Service.Seeing as how predictions are so useful, Andrew Ferguson and I have decided to put the Obama re-elect probability in the topline. We give two probabilities, which are built on the same assumptions that went into calculating the “strike zones” in the history graph. The “Random Drift” number is a minimum (conservative) probability, and the “Bayesian Prediction” is my best shot at calculating the actual win probability. In the coming 10 days, the two numbers will converge.I will list the assumptions again. This will make the most sense if you know a little about what we do here at the Princeton Election Consortium.Both predictions (“random drift” and “prediction”) start from a current snapshot of polling conditions, the Meta-Analysis of State Polls which forms the core of this site. The snapshot is listed in the top line above. It is currently Obama 297 EV, Romney 241 EV, Meta-margin Obama +1.96%. This predicts what would happen in an election held today.To calculate this snapshot, we (a) use recent polls for each state (3 polls or 7 days, whichever is greater) to calculate the probability that one candidate is ahead, (b) calculate the exact distribution of all 2^51 = 2.3 quadrillion outcomes, measured in terms of electoral votes (EV), and (c) take the median of the distribution to get an expected outcome.In addition, we calculate the amount by which polls must swing overall to create a perfect toss-up. This quantity is just like a two-candidate margin that people are used to seeing in polls, so we call it the Meta-Margin. Both the EV estimator and Meta-Margin are extremely precise, and performed very well on Election Eve in 2004 and 2008.Between now and Election Day, opinion may move toward Obama or toward Romney. But by how much? To turn the snapshot into a prediction, we have to estimate how much movement may occur. There are two ways to do so. I have explained these before (“The Presidential predictor sharpens,” September 29). Here is how they fit into what’s listed above.Random drift. Using past races, I have estimated how much the Meta-Margin is likely to fluctuates over time. In this “random drift” model, I assume that opinion is equally likely to move in either direction. (Nerds: at N days before the election, the drift has a standard deviation of 0.4% * sqrt(N).) If the Meta-Margin stays above zero, then Obama wins. Today, the probability of an Obama win is 89%.Bayesian prediction. Here I make an additional assumption, that the final outcome is likely to be drawn from the values that the Meta-Margin has explored this year. This is equivalent to the idea that the Meta-Margin is more likely to move towards its average (Obama +3.1+/-1.3%) than away from it. This has been the case in past elections. In statistics this is called a “Bayesian prior,” as in prior assumption. Today, including that prior gives a win probability of 97%.The prior is also used to calculate the red and yellow “strike zones” in the history graph.In my view, the prediction is the correct probability. But if the prior seems like an unwarranted assumption to you, then use the Random Drift probability instead. This is a more conservative estimate. Anyway, over the coming days these probabilities will converge to the same value.

"Vote for the Mormon, not the Muslim! The Capitalist, not the Communist!" read the sign outside Church of the Valley in Leakey, Texas. Beyond its inaccuracies, it was a clear violation of federal tax code, which prohibits nonprofits from doing anything that might support a candidate running for office.But a revocation of the church's tax-exempt status isn't likely to come soon—if ever.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has officially halted tax audits of churches until it can adopt rules that clarify which high-level employee has the authority to initiate them."We are holding any potential church audits in abeyance," Russell Renwicks of the IRS's Tax-Exempt and Government Entities division told BNA.com this week.While this is the first public announcement of the moratorium, the IRS hasn't been auditing churches since 2009, said Erik Stanley, senior legal counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund).That's when a federal court found that the IRS wasn't following its own regulations.An IRS official at the level of regional commissioner or above is required to approve any church audits before they are initiated, according to a law passed in 1984. But in 1996, Congress reorganized the IRS from geographical regions to national practice groups—a move that eliminated the office of regional commissioner."The IRS designated an official within [its] exempt organizations section to be the one to approve the church audits," Stanley said.But that position did not rank high enough to be adequate, the court decided after a Minnesota church challenged the legitimacy of their audit in 2009."The IRS shut down all church audits at the time," Stanley said. The agency proposed new regulations in 2009, but never got past the review process, he said."After that, it has taken absolutely no action on finalizing the regulations," he said. "They've just been sitting out there."No one seems to know why the IRS hasn't changed its regulations to allow another position to approve the audits, or why IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman hasn't been approving church audits in the interim. Shulman will step down November 9, the end of his five-year term."They could finalize those regulations whenever they wanted to," Stanley said.Rob Boston, senior policy analyst for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, also doesn't know why the finalization has taken so long."All we get are drops of information here and there, which sometimes seem to point in different directions," he said.The hotly contested presidential election this year has seen plenty of churches violate the rules, Boston said."This is absolutely the worst time for the IRS to be taking a step back," he said. "The agency needs to resolve this matter and move forward with enforcement. If they fail to do that, we're only going to see more flagrant violations of the law."But most pastors don't need the IRS to stop them from offering voting advice from the pulpit. According to a recent LifeWay Research poll, almost 90 percent of Protestant pastors believe they should keep endorsements out of the pulpit—up from about 85 percent who felt that way last year.On the other hand, most pastors—79 percent, according to a 2011 LifeWay survey—believe the government should not "regulate sermons by revoking a church's tax exemption if its pastor approves of or criticizes candidates based on the church's moral beliefs or theology."Sally Wagenmaker, an attorney who works with nonprofits, said she urges her clients to exercise caution when using the "vote" word."However, the more the government has been appropriating areas of morality, the closer we get to this intersection of churches not able to speak upon acute [moral] issues in a political campaign," she said. "There has never been a better time to challenge constitutionality. [And] this is probably the worst time [for the IRS] to push on enforcing this prohibition."

Californians voter appear to have voted overwhelmingly to reform their state’s draconian “three strikes” law. The measure, Proposition 36, which enjoyed a huge lead in early returns, will close a controversial loophole in the law so that life sentences can only be imposed when the new felony conviction is “serious or violent.”Three strikes laws, often known as habitual offender laws, grew out of the “tough on crime” era of the 1980s and 90s. Between 1993 and 1995, 24 states passed some kind of three strikes law, but California’s 1994 three-strikes ballot measure was especially harsh.While the law required the first and second strike to be either violent or serious, any infraction can trigger a third strike and the life sentence that goes with it. Therefore, petty offenses – such as stealing a piece of pizza – have led to life imprisonment for thousands of people.Although 25 other states have passed three-strikes laws, only California punishes minor crimes with a life sentence. In fact, 3,700 prisoners (more than 40 percent of the total third-strike population of about 8,500) in the state are serving life for a third strike that was neither violent nor serious. Because of its unique stringency, California’s habitual offender law has generated numerous legal challenges based on the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution barring cruel and unusual punishment.Voters in California have put an end to one of the harshest and least effective sentencing laws in the country. Proposition 36 ensures that no more people are sentenced to life in prison for minor and nonviolent drug law violations.Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, issued the following statement:“Californians finally appear to be coming to their senses on the basic question of who deserves to spend the rest of his or her life behind bars,” said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.  “Locking up people for life whose only recent offense was a minor violation of the state’s drug laws never made sense in terms of public safety, finance or morality.  California at last is rejoining the civilized world.”

The president found his voice in the second debate, but he still needs to make a clearer case for the progress he’s made.There has been entirely too much celebrating about President Obama’s debate performance on Tuesday. He did very well, without a doubt. He won hands down. He didn’t get into the ring cold, and he showed that he knew his stuff—and that Romney really didn’t.But the economy remains the ace in the hole for Romney and Ryan. We haven’t nearly recovered in terms of jobs, and that’s a tough fact to slide by. The unemployment rate rose rapidly in Bush’s last term to around 8 percent, then peaked in 2009 at 10 percent and slowly came down to its current level. So we are only back to the start of the Obama term. No one ever won the presidency with a 7.8 percent unemployment rate. And we know, as Romney keeps reminding us, that median family income is awful and that poverty is up.Everyone knows this, and yet Obama did not have a good enough explanation of how much progress has been made. He sounded defensive. So Obama needs a strong, non-defensive explanation of his achievements, and one way to put it is what would have happened had Romney won the presidency in 2008. You’d have a 10 percent unemployment rate with Romney as president. Poverty would be way up. He’d be blaming Social Security and Medicare for all his problems, and he’d find economists to claim he was right. They might already be cutting these programs forever “in order to save them.” It’s triage — throw the elderly out of the boat and let everyone else eat the rations. People would be poorer. They would get less health care. Those in poverty would have fewer benefits. Is that the kind of America you want?Odds are that Romney, if he put the Romney/Ryan plan into effect, would create a bigger deficit, too. That’s actually what we need, but a deficit based on tax cuts will create few jobs. (EPI ran some numbers based on Mark Zandi’s multipliers.) And if Romney did close the many tax holes he promises to, recession is almost guaranteed even as your taxes rise.This concept is tough to communicate in a credible way. It just sounds like economists bickering. But there is a record out there: George W. Bush’s. His central economic policy was tax cuts for the rich, and he produced the slowest job growth of any president since the Depression. Romney will do that again. Promise.

Two months ago, Gov. Chris Christie was delivering the keynote at the Republican National Convention. Now, six days before Election Day, he gives President Obama just what he needs: a vision of bipartisanship.Technically, President Obama is off the campaign trail Wednesday. But really, he isn’t. When the president steps out to view storm damage in New Jersey with Republican Gov. Chris Christie – keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention just two months ago – it will be politics by other means.And it will be pure gold, for two reasons.  First, Mr. Obama gets the obvious photo opportunity of himself acting as commander in chief, in charge, projecting calm, reiterating the message he has put out since superstorm Sandy began to loom: We’re here to help. Whatever you need from Washington, let us know.The Obama-Christie photo op will be the picture of the day, not Republican challenger Mitt Romney’s three campaign events in Florida.This assumes that Governor Christie doesn’t blow his stack and tell Obama that Washington has done a terrible job. With the outspoken Christie, you never know. But so far, Christie has been Obama’s best friend during a catastrophe that has hit the New Jersey coast particularly hard.  On Tuesday, Christie did the rounds on morning TV, praising Obama’s performance. “It’s been very good working with the president and his administration,” Christie said on MSNBC. “It’s been wonderful.”Christie has also made clear that politics is the least of his concerns. When asked in a briefing Tuesday with reporters about how the storm might affect Election Day, he said: “I don’t give a [expletive] about Election Day.”But here’s the second reason the Obama-Christie team-up, six days before Election Day, is worth its weight in gold to both men’s political futures: Voters – especially independent voters – want more bipartisanship, polls show. This presidential campaign has been the most toxic in memory, but the Obama-Christie photo op is living evidence that when the going gets tough, members of competing parties really can work together.Of course, we’re not talking about the "fiscal cliff." It’s easy to put politics aside when matters of life and death are on the line. But voters may find some comfort that there are limits to the political gamesmanship that infuses Washington.  No less a partisan than Republican commentator Dick Morris commented recently on voters’ desire for bipartisanship.“While we professionals are trying to win the war of Democrats vs. Republicans and blue vs. red,” Mr. Morris wrote Oct. 6 on the website RealClearPolitics, “the voters just want the war to end and the parties to come to an agreement, guided by the verdict they will deliver on Election Day.”

There have been the tens of thousands of people who have signed petitions expressing the desire for their states to secede from the union. Well, there is no state that is dumb enough to want to do that, especially not the states where most of these petitions signers come from. You see, the people who run those states know that they are on the federal dole. They receive much more in federal benefits than they pay in federal taxes.However, the folks behind these petitions are clearly of a mind to sever their ties to the United States. They think they would be better off if they were not burdened by being U.S. citizens.Luckily for them there is an easy solution. Federal law provides an easy process for people to renounce their citizenship. There are a few requirements, but they are easily met. All they have to do is appear in person before a U.S. consular or diplomatic officer in a foreign country (normally at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate) and sign an oath of renunciation.Sure they will have to pay all the taxes the owe and a special tax penalty under the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008. But that's a tiny price to pay for freedom from the United States and its evil Kenyan, Socialist, post hoc colonial, communist President and all those who voted for him. Besides, America is doomed anyway with but a few months left.There you have it. For all those wishing to secede, the power is in your hands. Take a drive down to Guadalajara, visit the local U.S. consulate, and sign a piece of paper. In no time at all you will be relieved of the burden of U.S. citizenship. And there's more good news. There is one country sure to accept you with open arms. It is called Dimbulbistan.There is also a possibility that if you solicit contributions there may be folks willing to give you gas money.

Aetna's CEO, Mark Bertolini, is a man who feels entitled.  His team lost the election, but he;s not going to let the votes of a lot of "little people" get in the way of demanding the Federal Government do what he wants or else, in his own words,Yes, that's right, one of the highest compensated chief executives in the country, is threatening to make you suffer unless he gets a deal that eliminates tax increases of roughly 3% on the income of people who earn over $250,000 a year.  Oh and he also wants to delay (if not eliminate) implementation of the provisions of affordable care act.You can read all the nitty-gritty details regarding his attitude of entitlement and his lacvish lifestyle  in this Daily Kos diary.  The short version: Mr.Bertolini is highly compensated for running a company, the third largest health care company in the US, that provides some of the worst insurance health plans in the country as rated by their customers.  Needless to say, they are also one of the most profitable:Aetna said its third-quarter profit had risen to $499.2 million, or $1.47 per share, from $490.4 million, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier. Excluding tax benefits and other special items, earnings rose to $1.55 per share from $1.40. That was ahead of analysts' average estimate of $1.34, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [...] Aetna's revenue increased to $8.9 billion from $8.4 billion, in line with expectations. The company attributed the rise to higher insurance premiums in its commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses.So, not only is Aetna making huge profits, but much of its revenue is attributable to charging higher premiums for its Medicare and Medicaid plans.  In short, Aetna is milking the Federal Cash Cow big time, charging more for delivering less.  And it's CEO has the gall to threaten to make Americans "suffer" if he doesn't get his way so he can continue to pull down an outrageous income and his company can continue to profit off the misery of its customers.Now, I understand that many of you may not have any direct investments in Aetna.  But you may own mutual funds through your 401K plan or IRA that do invest in Aetna. You may have a pension plan or annuity you purchased that invests in Aetna.  I have a modest IRA left over from monies I set aside before I became disabled.  I strongly suspect that one of the mutual funds in which my IRA is invested probably owns some Aetna stock.  After all, health insurance companies are doing well in the Great Recession, even if many millions of Americans are not, the same people Mr. Bertolini wants to make "suffer" (i.e., more than Aetna's customers and employees are already suffering) unless President Obama and the Democrats do his bidding.Obviously, Mr. Bertolini is not a man who got to his position in life by exhibiting compassion or empathy for people who purchase his company's insurance or earn their living working in professions that don't screw people over, so an appeal to the "better angels of our nature" to quote Abraham Lincoln isn;t likely to work with him.  Therefore, I thought a more direct approach might get his attention.  Here is the text of my tweet to M. Berolini who can be reached at @mtbert:Feel free to send a similar message to Mr. Bertolini to let him know that suffering can be a two way street.UPDATE:  After reading p gorden lippy's comment, I encourage you to use the hashtag #DumpAetna on any tweet you might make regarding this bully and his threats.

The mother of a former Navy SEAL killed in Libya has called on Mitt Romney to stop talking about her son during his political campaign.The mother of a former Navy SEAL killed in Libya has called on Mitt Romney to stop talking about her son during his political campaign.A spokesman for the Republican presidential candidate says Romney will respect her wishes.Romney in recent days has been telling voters of chance encounter with the former SEAL, Glen Doherty, at a Christmas party two or three years ago. Doherty was among four Americans killed in the attacks in Benghazi.Romney told the story of his chance encounter with Doherty at least twice in the last two days as part of a larger push to show a more personal side and criticize President Barack Obama's foreign policy. Romney, like other Republicans, have repeatedly raised questions about the president's handling of the Sept. 11 attack.Indeed, the Benghazi terrorist strike that left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens dead was a centerpiece of Romney's high-profile foreign policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute earlier in the week.On Wednesday, Doherty's mother, Barbara Doherty, told Boston television station WHDH that she wanted Romney to stop citing her son."I don't trust Romney. He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama," Barbara Doherty said.Romney spokesman Rick Gorka said: "Gov. Romney was inspired by the memory of meeting Glen Doherty and shared his story and that memory, but we respect the wishes of Mrs. Doherty."Romney told the Doherty story at his first stop in Ohio on Wednesday, but did not at his next two public appearances.

Statues that give the Wisconsin governor power to approve or block new education policies is unconstitutional, a Madison judge ruled Tuesday.The decision overturns -- only as it applies to the state's Department of Public Instruction -- a law enacted last May that gives the governor authority to kill rules proposed by state agencies. The legislation was passed as part of a special legislative session on jobs that Republican Gov. Scott Walker called last year.The state's superintendent of public instruction is unique among state department chiefs, however, in that the responsibilities held by the position are expressly stated in the state constitution. The DPI is currently headed by state schools Superintendent Tony Evers."Administrative rule-making is an important way in which a superintendent exercises his or her constitutional authority over the supervision of public instruction," Dane County Circuit Judge Amy Smit wrote in the decision. "Because Act 21 allows the governor to bar the superintendent from proposing rules, or even from beginning the process of rule-making by submitting a scope statement to the Legislature, Act 21 places the governor in a position superior to the superintendent in the supervision of public instruction."The ruling responds to a lawsuit filed last year by parents and members of teachers unions Wisconsin Education Association Council and Madison Teachers Inc. challenging the law's constitutionality. The state constitution says that "the supervision of public instruction shall be vested in a state superintendent and such other officers as the Legislature shall direct." The plaintiffs cited a 1996 Supreme Court decision ruling that the governor and state lawmakers cannot give "equal or superior authority" over public education to any other official.To be sure, the law is still in effect for other state agencies, requiring them to submit policy proposals to the governor for approval before handing them off to the state legislature. Previously, lawmakers did not require the governor's pre-approval to enact new agency rules. Democrats quickly labeled the law a power grab by Walker, and Evers had asked the court to block the policy. Evers expressed in a statement Tuesday that he is pleased with the judge's ruling."I have been consistent in my opposition to this legislation on constitutional grounds and had proposed remedies during the legislative debate on this law," Evers said. "My concerns are validated by this ruling."Walker had said the law served to pull back on the broad rule making authority that has expanded to agency bureaucrats over the years, hurting businesses and turning policymaking more opaque. Walker's office has also promised to appeal Smith's ruling."We are confident we'll win upon appeal," Walker spokesperson Cullen Werwie told the Wisconsin State Journal.Walker has held a controversial governorship in education, carrying a tumultuous relationship with labor unions and teachers. The Tuesday decision is just the latest in a series of Walker policies struck down in court,including one that severely limits collective bargaining for teachers and other public employees.The decision comes as about two-thirds of Wisconsin's school districts see a drop in state funding this year, marking the second of a two-year, $834 million education budget reduction plan signed by Walker last summer.The 272 districts facing reductions this year yields a slight improvement from last year, when nearly all of the state's 424 school systems saw drops in state funding, according to figures released this week by the state Department of Public Instruction.Walker's budget was signed in an effort to plug the state's $3 billion shortfall as of last year. The two-year $66 billion plan initially reduced collective bargaining for teachers to much backlash, resulting in a number of cutbacks including scrapped programs and layoffs.

Voters in some parts of Florida are waiting as long as four hours to cast their ballots before early voting ends Saturday night.The Miami-Dade County Election Department was reporting early voting wait times in excess of one hour at all 20 of its polling locations. At two locations – the Election Department main office and the North Dade Regional Library – officials were reporting wait times of four hours.The ballot in Miami-Dade County is five pages long, front and back, with an estimated completion time of as long as 30 minutes.Farther north, in the Tampa Bay area, election officials were reporting shorter wait times at most polling sites, with only a handful exceeding 45 minutes.When asked about how voters waiting in lines were reacting to the lines in Hillsborough County, Travis Abercrombie, the public information coordinator for the Hillsborough County Elections Office, said they have “the patience of Job.”The early voting window was reduced by Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott from 14 to 8 days, or from 120 to 96 hours.The large turnout in some South Florida counties prompted some groups, including the League of Women Voters and the Florida Democratic Party, to call on Scott to extend voting hours,  as then-Gov. Charlie Crist did in 2008. But Scott declined, telling reporters at a fundraiser in Newberry, Fla., that early voting would end Saturday night, as scheduled.“Once again, Rick Scott has sided against the people of Florida,” said Scott Arceneaux,  executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.  ”In rejecting calls for an extension of early voting hours, Scott has failed in his constitutionally obligated duty, broken with the history of past Republican governors and reminded Florida voters why they continue to hold a negative opinion of this governor. The people of Florida will not forget his failure to stand up for their right to vote.”

In the last presidential election, as much as I looked for it, I really didn't find much evidence of vote fraud. (I guess the economy was so bad, they didn't want it enough to steal it.) But this year, it's happening in so many places, I can't keep track. Via AmericaBLOG:There was a story over at NBC’s The Grio three days ago noting that at one Florida polling location, in a heavily black neighborhood, the number of people who voted early was suddenly “revised” from 2,945 to 1,942 – that’s a 34% decrease.At first, polling officials blamed it on a “computer glitch.” Uh huh. And what glitch would that be?The local supervisor of elections (SOE) didn’t inspire a lot of hope when speaking about another, smaller, change to the early voting numbers at another polling location:spirit of america /Shutterstock.comBroward SOE spokesperson Mary Cooney acknowledged that the Sunday totals were revised, and said she would look into why. “I can’t tell you definitively now,” Cooney said, “but I queried the person who posts those numbers and the most significant number he told me he changed was an instance where 1050 should have been 1150 — the numbers were transposed.”He transposed the numbers by hand? And this is how Florida tallies votes?The Grio followed up on the story the next day, Tuesday of this week, and got a different answer about the 1,000 vote discrepancy: now they’re saying “human error.”The SOE chief says the changes, particularly at a polling place in a predominantly black neighborhood where National Action Network chief and MSNBC host Rev. Al Sharpton and a group of pastors held “souls to the polls” rallies over the weekend, were the result of human error. In a telephone interview with theGrio late Monday, Snipes said the SOE’s office runs two tallies — one manually calculated at the precincts by adding up the total number of voters swiped through an electronic voter identification system called EVID, which was purchased from a Florida vendor, and a second, electronic tally conducted at the Supervisor of Elections office after the polls close each day. The electronic numbers go directly to a database. Snipes said the woman who tallied the votes at the E. Pat Larkins Community Center, which had its vote tally revised downward by 1,003, simply added the numbers incorrectly. “The woman made a mistake,” Snipes said. “That was absolutely an addition error. The actual numbers are 1942 not 2945, so she made an addition error.”In the future, they’re only going to report the electronic result, which still begs the question of which result is really correct, and what else do they do that might result in human error? Not to mention, why did they first say it was a computer glitch?And why is it always Florida? Why always in a heavily Democratic precinct, and why do the errors always help the other guy? Remember that Florida is already dealing with a widespread GOP voter fraud scandal.

Appearing on Monday night’s episode of “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore begged Democrats to go vote, saying: “Don’t trust that this is in the bag.”Even though President Barack Obama is widely projected to win, Moore insisted that more than 90 million people still likely won’t vote, meaning there’s no way to say who’s really going to be the next president.“So many people fought for this right, it was so hard because we have fought voter suppression for 200-plus years of this country,” he said. “Exercise that right. Go to the polls. Don’t stay home. It’s only 20 minutes, and it’s free. It’s your country.”He added that there’s a “goldmine” of potential Obama voters among those who normally don’t cast ballots, many more of whom polls show would vote for Obama than Romney. “We all know somebody,” Moore said. “Make it your mission [Tuesday] to get that person out to vote. Take them to lunch, take them to the bar afterwards, do whatever you have to do that’s legal to get them to the polls. And they’ll feel good that they did this, and they’ll maybe vote again next time.”Most important of all, he stressed, is that Democrats don’t become too presumptuous as the night rolls on. “Don’t trust that this is in the bag,” he concluded. “Don’t do the end zone dance tonight. Everybody, up in the morning. Get out and vote and get out there and get people to vote, because that other side, believe me, they’re going to be out there.”This video is from MSNBC’s “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” aired Monday, November 5, 2012.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy

[Look for your weekly fix from the one and only Henry Rollins right here on West Coast Sound every Thursday, and come back tomorrow for the awesomely annotated playlist for his Saturday KCRW broadcast.]I am in Washington DC right now. The time before the winner of the presidency was announced was peppered with joyful moments. Akin gone, Mourdock done, Walsh finished, Scott Brown will be pulling Elizabeth Warren's shoe out of his ass for weeks to come. George Allen conceding in real time was better than pizza. All evening long, I had been sitting on the same couch I was four years ago when Mr. Obama won against John McCain.See also: Henry Rollins: The Column! Occupy AmericaAt 2315 hrs. the screen cut to Chicago and a sea of people going absolutely apeshit and suddenly, it was over. I must admit, I truly enjoyed the electoral college track up to 270 for our president. As much as I was happy that the president gets another four years, I was happier that Mitt Romney can have less opportunities to lower the bar.I am not one to gloat nor am I one to run around yelling that I won something when an election goes my way. It is actually more a feeling of relief than anything else. I consider what could have been and think to myself that we all are better off for what happened. I noticed that underneath articles I read online where people post their sentiments, there seemed to be a foaming at the mouth jock mentality amongst those who cast their vote for Mitt Romney. "You libtards are gonna get crushed!" and other predictions occurred frequently. I wondered what they meant by that. Presumably, their man Mitt was going to create a bunch of jobs, slash the deficit and make Americans safe not only inside their own country but all over the world. I would hate to see a bunch of people getting crushed.Perhaps they were merely going by what Mr. Romney promised to do on the first day of his administration. Presumably, on this miraculous day, the man would have been a blur of activity, where he magically took the power of the other two branches of government; the legislative and the judicial and in a few fell swoops and slashes of his mighty pen, overturned Roe v. Wade, defunded Planned Parenthood and decimated Obamacare. That would have indeed been a good bit of crushing. The irony of the amount of people who voted for Romney who would be negatively impacted by this is incredible. But thankfully it was not to be. Enough Americans saw fit to give president Obama a second term. I don't think there will be many people keeping their Romney/Ryan bumper stickers on their cars.

This is commentary from political blogger and cartoonist Rob Tornoe.Sometimes, political cartooning is an exercise in venting my frustrations.Take the reaction to President Obama's reelection by "the Papa," Papa John's CEO John Schnatter. A fervent Mitt Romney supporter, the Papa injected politics into the sauce of his pizza back in August when he complained that due to Obamacare, he would be forced to raise the prices of his pizzas.Now that Obama has been re-elected, and Mitt Romney is depressingly taking rides up and down on his car elevator, the Papa has doubled down on his threat, warning that his chain may cut his minimum-wage employee's hours to avoid paying for their healthcare.It doesn't anger me that someone like the Papa, who resides in a 40,000 square-foot mansion with its own private golf course and a 22-car garage, would be looking to fill his own pockets before doing right by his employees.That's the American Dream. As Mitt Romney said while attending a fundraiser at the Papa's mansion, "Who would've imagined pizza could build this. This is really something. Don't you love this country? What a home this is, what grounds these are, the pool, the golf course... Republicans come here and say everyone should live like this." No, what angers me most are people that can't even criticize this sort-of behavior because of the ideological told-hold the right has on their common sense. The Papa's big beef, according to a conference call he made to shareholders, was that because his wildly profitable company doesn't provide health care to its employees, Obamacare would force them to do so, increasing the cost of one of their pizzas by as much as... gasp... 20 cents. So the rising costs of the old health care system prevented him from giving all his employees health care, and now 20 cents a pizza will do it? The Papa should't be arguing against Obamacare, he should be making ads for it!?? After all, 20 cents extra a pizza is nothing compared to the cost of adding an extra topping, and more than half the price of an extra garlic sauce. As Amy Bingham from ABC News noted, if you want that piping hot pie delivered, the $2 delivery fee will cost you 10 times more than it would cost the Papa to provide his employees with health care.Instead of raising the cost of his pizza by the amount most people can find in their sofa, the Papa has chosen instead to punish the same employees that are the backbone of his wealth, simply to make a political statement. ??The Papa is also taking a chance with the business of many Papa John's franchise owners across the country.By going so political so publicly, he risks a blow back of angry customers in a market even more saturated than the fat in its products. Think of a state like New Jersey, where 58 percent of voters cast their ballot for Obama. Do you really want to risk making their pizza choices partisan? ??"It felt like sabotage from our own CEO," said James Applebaum, who worked as a driver at a Papa John's franchise in Ramsey when the Papa began to speak out against President Obama. "If the company were in financial danger, then I would understand some of what [the Papa] wishes to implement.The fact that they merely seem to stem from one man's political views is an outrage. "??So way to go Papa. I'm sure it won't be hard for New Jerseyans to find another pizza joint to support. After all, there are great Mom and Pop shops on nearly every corner of the state, owned and run by people who live in the community. Their kids probably play with your kids. Sure, they may not have Peyton Manning hawking their pizzas, but at least they're probably made with fresh dough and handmade sauce.Rob Tornoe is a political cartoonist and a WHYY contributor.

James Bond is clearly a sociopath. He disposes of human life and property with abandon. He consumes women like they were snack foods. Of course, he does all this in the service of Queen and country, so we forgive him his disregard for most of the values we hold dear. And because he does it with a certain élan, impeccably tailored suits, and a well-turned quip to go with every kill shot, for 50 years he has been one of those iconic characters men wanted to be and women wanted to be with.Even in the latest installment in the Bond saga, Skyfall, which opened in the United States last week, Daniel Craig, whose Bond is the best and most nuanced of all the incarnations of Ian Fleming's super-spy, shows his human side not so much by revealing conscience or qualms about what he does but rather by appearing wearied by all the mayhem he has had to stir up and endure. Which is apparently fine by all of us -- Skyfall has already grossed more than half a billion dollars worldwide and is setting box-office records for the series.The real question is: Do we love Bond because of his yacht and fast-car propelled globe-trotting lifestyle (he seems to be the only one who can dependably find casinos that are glamorous rather than being full of fat old losers playing the slots), or because he is actually able to get away with blowing so much stuff up without having to pay for it?It all seems like an escapist ideal, a parallel universe in which all morality has been suspended except for the bits that don't get in the way of fun and a good story. In fact, ennobling patriotism is fine because it seems to provide the free pass that in the end is Bond's license to kill, love ‘em and leave ‘em, and tear open passenger trains with a back-hoe. It is preposterous. Fiction. And so of course, the only thing more preposterous is real life.That was made clear when, in a tour de force of movie marketing that surpassed even this summer's stunt of having Bond and the Queen seemingly enter the Olympic stadium via parachute, America's real-life spy chief commanded the headlines with his own Bond-like behavior. David Petraeus, one of the most heralded American generals of the post-World War II period, was brought down as head of the CIA because, as everyone now knows, he had an affair with his glamorous biographer. (Glamour is relative. But the bar set by most biographers is fairly low and, Petraeus's lover, Paula Broadwell had extremely well-toned upper arms according to the assessments of every woman I have spoken with on the subject.) Citing his principles, Petraeus stepped down from his post rather than bring any further dishonor upon it.Now, many people I know and respect greatly consider Petraeus to be an extremely admirable, capable, and intelligent guy. But the notion that the violation of anyone's "principles" led to his resignation is laughable. Further, the idea that an affair involving the CIA director would trigger a national scandal when the daily activities of the agency do not is ludicrous bordering on offensive.

Maybe it’s the fact that people are tired of having their favorite TV shows as a side dish to political attack ads this time of year, but a new poll shows that Americans think there’s way too much money in politics. Almost 90 percent of respondents agree there’s too much corporate money in politics, with 51 percent strongly agreeing, according to a new poll released today by the Corporate Reform Coalition. The poll of 804 Americans was conducted by the Democratic-leaning P.R. firm Bannon Communications.The survey found that 76 percent of Americans support a requirement that corporations publicly disclose their contributions to groups that funnel money into politics, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, 81 percent think corporations should only spend money on political campaigns if they disclose their spending immediately, while 80 percent said they think companies should have to get approval from shareholders before getting involved in politics. These two questions reflect two of the most prominent ideas pushed by campaign finance reformers. The DISCLOSE Act, a bill that has so far been blocked by Republicans on Capitol Hill, would significantly bolster disclosure regulations for election spending, while activist shareholders and some state legislatures have tried to give shareholders sway over how the companies they invest in spend resources on political action. The Corporate Reform Coalition is a coalition of progressive, mostly good government, groups fighting Citizens United and corporate money in politics.But corporate money is only one piece of the problem. A new study from Public Citizen notes that most super PACS only support a single candidate, a fact that undermines the Supreme Court’s  argument in the Citizens United decision. Of the more than 100 super PACs that have spent at least $100,000 so far this year, 65 were active in only a single race. These single-candidate groups — which include two of the biggest ones, the Mitt Romney-backing Restore Our Future and the Obama-backing Priorities USA — account for 55 percent of the $370 million spent by all active super PACs so far. But most, 69 groups, are devoted solely to congressional elections, and 39 of those have worked on behalf of only one candidate.Taylor Lincoln of Public Citizen says the real importance of the study is not about the numbers but about the intellectual foundation of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. In the decision, the Court agreed that very large direct contributions to candidates can be corrupting, so the government can and should regulate them. But the Court also said that independent spending groups, like super PACs, can’t possibly be corrupting because it’s done independently of candidates, so there’s no opportunity for quid pro quos. “The whole point of our report is that that’s a fictional distinction,” Lincoln explained. With super PACs, which are often started by former staffers of the candidate, politicians can essentially set up parallel candidate committees ”outside the walls of the campaign finance system.” Indeed, this has become pretty clear in the two years since the court’s ruling. Someone seeking to influence a candidate may actually have a far easier time doing it now than before the case, because they can give so much more money than they ever could. This is hardly shocking news, but the numbers add some compelling details.

It is too simplistic to conclude that demography equals destiny. Both men are being sincere when they vow to serve the interests of all Americans. But it would be disingenuous to pretend not to notice the obvious cleavage between those who have long held power in this society and those who are beginning to attain it.When Republicans vow to “take back our country,” they never say from whom. But we can guess.Issues of race, power and privilege are less explicit this year than they were in 2008, but in some ways they are even stronger.Four years ago, we asked ourselves whether the nation would ever elect a black president. The question was front and center. Every time we see the president and his family walk across the White House lawn to board Marine One, we’re reminded of the answer.The intensity of the opposition to Obama has less to do with who he is than with the changes in U.S. society he not only represents but incarnates. Citing his race as a factor in the way some of his opponents have bitterly resisted his policies immediately draws an outraged cry: “You’re saying that just because I oppose Obama, I’m a racist.” No, I’m not saying that at all.What I’m saying is that Obama’s racial identity is a constant reminder of how much the nation has changed in a relatively short time. In my lifetime, we’ve experienced the civil rights movement, the countercultural explosion of the 1960s, the sexual revolution, the women’s movement and an unprecedented wave of Latino immigration. Within a few decades, there will be no white majority in this country — no majority of any kind, in fact. We will be a nation of racial and ethnic minorities, and we will only prosper if everyone learns to give and take.Our place in the world has changed as well. The United States remains the dominant economic and military power; our ideals remain a beacon for those around the globe still yearning to breathe free. But our capacity for unilateral action is diminished; we can assert but not dictate, and we must learn to persuade.Obama’s great sin, for some who oppose him, is to make it impossible to ignore these domestic and international megatrends. Take one look at Obama and the phenomenon of demographic change is inescapable. Observe his approach to international crises in places such as Libya or Syria and the reality of America’s place in the world is unavoidable.I’m deliberately leaving aside what should be the biggest factor in the election: Obama’s policies. It happens that I have supported most of them, but of course there are legitimate reasons to favor Romney’s proposals, insofar as we know what they really are — and the extent to which they really differ from Obama’s.In foreign affairs, judging by Monday’s debate, the differences are too small to discern; Romney promises to speak in a louder voice and perhaps deploy more battleships, but that’s about it. Domestically, however, I see a clear choice. I consider the Affordable Care Act a great achievement, and Romney’s promise to repeal it would alone be reason enough for me to oppose him. Add in the tax cuts for the wealthy, the plan to “voucherize” Medicare and the appointments Romney would likely make to the Supreme Court, and the implications of this election become even weightier.Issues may explain our sharp political divisions, but they can’t be the cause of our demographic polarization. White men need medical care, too. African Americans and Latinos understand the need to get our fiscal house in order. The recession and the slow recovery have taken a toll across the board.Some of Obama’s opponents have tried to delegitimize his presidency because he doesn’t embody the America they once knew. He embodies the America of now.

A Ten Commandments monument is up on the grounds of the state Capitol, but it didn't pass spell check.“Remember the Sabbeth day, to keep it holy,” reads one.“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidseruent,” reads the last one.Rep. Mike Ritze, whose family paid for the monument that was put up Thursday, said the monument company has been contacted and will correct the errors to the words Sabbath and maidservant.“It's a simple fix,” said Ritze, R-Broken Arrow, who hasn't seen the installed monument. “Scribner's errors or misspellings are not uncommon with monument manufacturing.”The changes likely will be made well before a decision is made by the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma to file a lawsuit over whether the monument is a violation of separation of state.Ryan Kiesel, the organization's executive director, said a constitutional challenge is being discussed.“It's premature at this point for us to say whether or not we're going to litigate this particular monument,” he said.“It's something that we are keeping an eye on, and we are reviewing the circumstances of the monument being placed at the state Capitol.”The monument was installed Thursday morning, three years after legislation was passed authorizing its placement on the Capitol grounds. No ceremony was held, and only a few spectators were on hand.The monument and the base it sits on were paid for with private funds. The Ritze family paid a private contractor to install the monument and has agreed to pay maintenance costs.“The state didn't do anything on that,” said John Morrison, administrator of the state's capital assets management division. “It was all private donations.”The monument, about 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide, is on the east side of the sidewalk near the north entrance of the Capitol, which has been closed for years.Ritze authored legislation in 2009 authorizing the monument on the Capitol grounds. The measure won bipartisan support; 83-2 in the House of Representatives and 38-8 in the Senate.Kiesel, then a Democratic House member, was among 16 absent when the final vote in the House was taken.“When the people of Oklahoma go to the state Capitol, they should feel welcomed there, regardless of whatever religion they practice or even if they don't practice anything at all,” Kiesel said Thursday.“One of the concerns of the Founders that they addressed through the First Amendment in the separation of church and state was that they wanted to ensure that all citizens regardless of their faith or no faith at all were equal in the eyes of the government.”

When Karl Rove’s Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies (GPS) formed in 2010, it established its official address in Warrenton, VA, and registered with the Internal Revenue Service a tax-exempt 501(c)(4) “social welfare organization.” It apparently did not, however, register as a charitable organization with the Commonwealth of Virginia, as appears was legally required.According to state code, non-profit groups that intend to solicit contributions must first register with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Office of Charitable and Regulatory Programs. Groups must pay an annual fee ($325 for groups raising over $1 million annually), provide basic information about their operations, and must sign statements affirming that no funds “have been or will knowingly be used, directly or indirectly, to benefit or provide support, in cash or in kind, to terrorists, terrorist organizations, terrorist activities, or the family members of any terrorist.”The Virginia law explicitly exempts political campaign committees that are “required by state or federal law to file a report or statement of contributions and expenditures.” Crossroads GPS has consistently kept its contributors secret as it has raised and spent tens of millions of dollars against Democratic candidates.While the group’s federal tax filings and registration with the District of Columbia indicate that it is a Virginia corporation — and Crossroads GPS did apparently register with the state’s corporation commission — the Office of Charitable and Regulatory Programs confirmed to ThinkProgress that no entity named Crossroads GPS or Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies has ever registered to solicit contributions in Virginia. Additionally, no entity with the tax identification number listed on Crossroads GPS’s tax filings has ever registered with the agency.A spokesman for Crossroads GPS did not respond to a ThinkProgress request for comment.

This news may raise alarms, but it shouldn’t surprise … it’s what these guys do. Dan Froomkin at the Huffington Post (my emphasis and some reparagraphing):A private equity company run by fervent supporters of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney bought the third-largest voting machine company in the country last July, raising concerns about the appearance of impropriety, if not the possibility of impropriety itself. Apprehension that Romney supporters could be literally buying votes has been burbling on left-wing blogs since Freepress.org, an alternative website based in Columbus, Ohio, reported late last month about H.I.G Capital’s purchase of Hart Intercivic [sic]. H.I.G. Capital is a Miami-based private equity fund that manages $8.5 billion in capital. Hart Intercivic is a company exclusively in the business of manufacturing and programming voting systems.Because the names are so similar, here’s a scorecard. Hart InterCivic is a manufacturing company; it’s all they do. H.I.G Capital is a private equity fund that purchases companies; it’s all they do. (Hm, a buyer of companies and a maker of things. Guess who’s king in that world?)After the expected (and totally necessary) disclaimer from the H.I.G. ”crisis communications consultant” — already? think they’re gearing up for a fight over this? — that H.I.G. is not up to no good, Froomkin tells why they might be (up to no good):H.I.G. Capital’s co-founder, Anthony Tamer, previously worked at Bain & Company…. Eight of the company’s managing directors came from Bain as well. Tamer and his wife are major Romney donors … And Tamer has plenty of company at H.I.G. Although it isn’t a particularly big firm, H.I.G.’s directors have collectively given so much money to Romney that their company is the sixth biggest contributor to all Romney committees, as calculated by opensecrets.org.Why does this matter? Aside from the obvious reasons, Ohio:There’s plenty more; do read on. A number of experts are interviews for this rather complete article.How to think about this? Of course, this could just be your innocent dinosaur-eats-dinosaur deal, corp-on-corp feeding, in which the only motive is the feast (i.e., making more money). And there are a number of sources in the article that do raise the “don’t jump to conclusions” flag.Still, others are quite suspicious. Think about it — Republicans. Voting machines. Bain. Ohio. Cause for concern? Many say yes.Me, I start wondering — at what tipping point will the toxic combo of Republican cheating, a narrow Romney win, and much suspicion, cause the real left to be told by our faux-left Democratic friends, “Don’t you dare think of Romney as not the rightful president”? Not that I don’t think the election isn’t still in the bag; it’s just that the bag has gotten smaller.About this last point, more later. For now, watch the Hamilton County (Cincinnati) vote total on election night. And if Obama’s vote count is low enough to pull his state-wide total into the loss column, watch the media say a whole lot of nothing about the possibility of a ballot-box fix.

  Frum on Morning Joe: a remarkable 15 minutes of television by David Atkins Former Bush speechwriter David Frummade a remarkable appearance on Morning Joe, saying things even many progressives often won't come out and say. The video is below. He begins with this: Mitt Romney's message is I am going to take away Medicare from everybody under 55, I'm going to cut Medicaid for everybody but about a third, and I'm going to do that to finance a giant tax cut for me and my friends, and the reason I'm doing that is because half the country contribute nothing to the national endeavor. Then about four minutes in, something even more attention-grabbing after Scarborough bloviated about Thatcher and Reagan appealing to the common man: Since the loss of the election, we have heard an enormous amount of discussion from Republicans on television and newspaper columns about immigration as an issue...but all of us who are allowed to participate in this conversation, we all have health insurance. And the fact that millions of Americans don't have health insurance, they don't get to be on television. And it is maybe a symptom of a broader problem, not just the Republican problem, that the economic anxieties of so many Americans are just not part of the national discussion at all. I mean, we have not yet emerged from the greatest national catastrophe, the greatest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression. And what are we talking about? The deficit and the debt. And these are important problems, but they're a lot easier to worry about if you are wealthier than you were in 2008, which most of the people on television now are again, if you are securely employed, which most of the people on television now are. But that's not true for 80% of America. And the Republican Party, the opposition party, needed to find some way to give voice to real urgent economic concerns held by middle class Americans. Latinos, yes, but Americans of all ethnicities.None of the panelists on Scaraborough--not Joe himself, not David Gregory, not Chuck Todd, none of them--dared to answer Frum's devastating indictment of them. Not of the Republican Party, but of them. It was uncomfortable, and then blithely ignored. Remarkable. After five full minutes of inside baseball speculation on Republican leadership games during which Frum looked like he might pull a Howard Beale (check out the look on Frum's face at 11:09 of the video!), he finally got a chance to speak again I believe the Republican Party is a party of followership. The problem with the Republican leaders is that they're cowards....The real locus of the problem is the Republican activist base and the Republican donor base. They went apocalyptic over the past four years. And that was exploited by a lot of people in the conservative world. I won't soon forget the lupine smile that played over the head of a major conservative institution when he told me that our donors think the apocalypse has arrived. Republicans have been fleeced and exploited and lied to by a conservative entertainment complex....Because the followers, the donors and the activists are so mistaken about the nature of the problems the country faces the nature--I mean, it's just a simple question. I went to Tea Party rallies and I would ask this question: "have taxes gone up or down in the past four years?" They could not answer that question correctly. Now it's true that taxes will go up if the President is re-elected. That's why we're Republicans. But you have to know that taxes have not gone up in the past. And "do we spend a trillion dollars on welfare?" Is that true or false? It is false. But it is almost universally believed. That means that the leaders have no space to operate.And to think that the guy who coined the phrase "axis of evil" is now the moral conscience of the Republican Party. How low they have truly fallen. .

It just hit me today. Romney, although pandering, honestly believes a few things in his core. That earnestness comes out in weird ways, like that story about him trying to give a half finished hot chocolate back to the Starbucks employee who served it to him. He was honestly baffled that someone wouldn't just take it back and drink it.I think he honestly believes he's a self-made man. His privileges don't seem to equate in his thinking. When he sees his wealth and achievements, he seems to forget the enormous advantages he got in education and resources. I mean, it's a rare thing for anyone to be able to sell stock to help pay for college.This kind of intellectual blind spot is dangerous in a President. It means that he isn't Machiavellian, or Rovian. There is no mustache twirling desire to defraud the American people and make the rich richer. He truly doesn't understand what it's like to juggle bills, wonder how to make rent, or think you'll never get a job again.And that blind spot means that, unlike say Franklin Roosevelt (Another child of privilege), Romney just can't see or understand what it's like for most people. It doesn't compute that parents can't just loan their kids money. He's never met someone who had to give their dad rent money, or worked a part-time job to help pay groceries.On some level, I think this is the real reason that Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama are so reviled by Republicans. Both of them started from much humbler beginnings. Obama, luckily for him, had middle-class grandparents. Clinton, though, had a much tougher start. Yet they both, through force of intellect and will rose into the wealthy and elite class of American life, without those blinders of privilege. On the contrary, those blinders don't exist for either of them, and Republicans seem to hate nothing more than successful people who refuse to wear those blinders.Clinton has blind spots, especially when it comes to personal responsibility. Obama does, too, strangely choosing (and being great at) politics, without having a good handle on the small moments that can create perceptions of aloofness.Those qualities aren't dangerous in leaders, however. But the earnest blind spot that Mitt Romney has for privilege is dangerous. Romney truly believes 47% of the nation are undeserving moochers, because he can't picture a world where he was helped to become wealthy.UPDATE - sorry, it wasn't Starbucks, it was Seattle's Best Coffee - http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/07/27/romney-offers-barista-half-consumed-hot-cocoa-in-lieu-of-tip

‘Out of touch’ doesn’t even begin to describe Mitt Romney. I can’t believe this country is thisclose to electing lying sociopath that is so obvious his handlers do little or nothing to stop the blatant horrors coming out of his mouth. In fact he has to have a team of like-minded people in order to unleash a continual stream of blunders and unmitigated falsehoods. That only makes it worse.So today Mittens holds his wholly off-the-mark (what’s new) “Sandy Relief” sideshow, collecting groceries at an Ohio campaign event for the Red Cross, which, along with other private charities has been clear that monetary donations to the orgs are the best way to assist those in need by getting relevant resources to victims of natural disasters. (Salon):It’s impossible not to see that this storm has devastated Mitt Romney’s presidential candidacy. The response to the hurricane has seemed like one long dramatic Obama campaign commercial, a lesson in “We’re all in this together,” while Romney, the man who said he’d dismantle FEMA, flails on the sidelines. Romney’s “relief” event outside of Dayton, Ohio, was surreal enough to be a campaign parody, with the candidate comparing the federal government’s hurricane relief efforts to the time he and some friends had to clean up a football field strewn with “rubbish and paper products.” It was supposed to be a parable of how Republicans handle disaster – with private charity, not government intervention – as Romney told his audience, “It’s part of the American spirit, the American way, to give to people in need.” The Republican went on to talk about the time some Hurricane Katrina survivors were rerouted from Houston to Cape Cod and the good people of Cape Cod responded by donating food and, yes, television sets.But who cares — he’s looking for the optics of caring, a quality the guy doesn’t remotely project, and undermines with his own words in public. He’s also having a hard time selling his “dump FEMA” and leave disaster relief to the states policy when one of his supporters, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, is not only praising the President, but thinks very little of Romney’s stunt.Romney promised to put the goods on a truck to where they’re needed, “I think New Jersey,” he said. That was a funny choice. Maybe it had to do with the fact that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has all but endorsed Obama in the last two days, repeatedly praising his “leadership.” He told the crew on “Morning Joe” that “It’s been very good working with the president. He and his administration have been coordinating with us. It’s been wonderful.” He told “Today” that FEMA’s response has been “excellent,” and he’s repeatedly tweeted his thanks to the president.Reporters would not let Mittens off of the hook about his plans for FEMA.“Gov are you going to eliminate FEMA?” a print pooler shouted, receiving no response. Wires reporters asked more questions about FEMA that were ignored. Romney kept coming over near pool to pick up more water. He ignored these questions: “Gov are you going to see some storm damage?” “Gov has [New Jersey Gov.] Chris Christie invited you to come survey storm damage?” “Gov you’ve been asked 14 times, why are you refusing to answer the question?”Romney won’t answer because he can’t.

The aftermath of superstorm Sandy has produced one of the strangest political pairings of the year, bringing together Barack Obama and one of Mitt Romney's most prominent supporters, Republican governor of New Jersey Chris Christie.The 50-year-old governor has emerged as the public face of the storm: energetic, emotional and efficient, a seemingly permanent presence on television screens over the last few days. Already well-known in the political world, he is now a national figure.With Sandy still too raw for anyone to start make political points, there has been no backlash from Republicans about his alliance with Obama only six days from election day. Christie has said politics do not matter to him at the moment. But on Monday, even before Christie lavishly praised the president's handling of the storm as "outstanding", the right-wing talk-show host Rush Limbaugh called the governor "fat" and "a fool".Christie was a keynote speaker for Romney at the Republican convention in Tampa this summer and has been out on the campaign trail regularly on his behalf. And yet he not only praised Obama but, unlike mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York, also agreed to host the president on a tour of the stricken parts of his state.So what is going on? Has Christie secretly harboured a grudge against Romney and grabbed the opportunity to try to sink his campaign? Or is he just being pragmatic, thinking locally, looking for maximum federal aid from Obama?One scenario is that although Christie has loyally campaigned publicly for Romney he privately does not really like him much.Evidence for this? When he delivered his keynote speech to the convention, delegates had anticipated a rousing build-up of Romney and a demolition job on Obama. In the end, in a televised address watched by tens of millions, he barely mentioned Romney, did not mention Obama at all and spoke mainly about himself.In all the interviews that Christie has given over the last few days, his response comes across as mainly emotional, the guy from Newark, New Jersey, overcome by the destruction of the beloved shoreline he knew from his youth. It could be as simple as this.The most Machiavellian of the scenarios is that Christie, who was pressed by many Republicans to stand for the White House this year but declined, is thinking that if Romney was to get elected next week, Romney might then go on to win again in 2016. Christie's first crack at the White House would then be 2020 and, given the normal tendency of the electorate to give another party a chance, he might be facing a strongly favoured Democrat. Better for him that Romney fails next week, leaving the way open for a Christie run in 2016.If the Republicans lose next week, they might just decide to move to the centre and that is where Christie has positioned himself, to the left of the present-day Republican party.The final and most plausible of the scenarios is that Christie is thinking not about 2016 but 2013 when he faces re-election for governor against a potentially strong Democratic field, of whom Newark mayor, Cory Booker, a strong orator, is favourite to face him in what is a traditionally Democratic-leaning state.It could be that, like all politicians, Christie holds in his head all these scenarios, emotional about the distress and damage before his eyes, and pragmatic too, but also thinking strategically to next year or even 2016.

In what his campaign billed as his “closing argument,” Mitt Romney warned Americans that a second term for President Obama would have apocalyptic consequences for the economy in part because his own party would force a debt ceiling disaster.“Unless we change course, we may well be looking at another recession,” Romney told a crowd in West Allis, Wisconsin.Romney said that Obama “promised to be a post-partisan president, but he became the most partisan” and that his bitter relations with the House GOP could threaten the economy. As his chief example, he pointed to a crisis created entirely by his own party’s choice — Republican lawmakers’ ongoing threat to reject a debt ceiling increase. Economists warn that a failure to pass such a measure would have immediate and catastrophic consequences for the recovery.“You know that if the President is re-elected, he will still be unable to work with the people in Congress,” Romney said. “He has ignored them, attacked them, blamed them. The debt ceiling will come up again, and shutdown and default will be threatened, chilling the economy.”Despite the apocalyptic warnings on the economy, most of the Republican nominee’s speech focused on a more modest argument that as president he would work with both sides to build a stronger economy. He said that, like Obama, “I promise change, but I have a record of achieving it.”“I won’t spend my effort trying to pass partisan legislation that’s unrelated to economic growth,” Romney said. “From day one, I will go to work to help Americans get back to work.”Romney’s warnings of a second recession came the same day as an unexpectedly strong jobs report which, combined with other recent indicators, has many economists hopeful that the recovery may be gaining strength. Many current projections show the economy picking up steam in the near term regardless of who wins the presidency, leading to speculation on a looming battle over who deserves the credit.With four days left, Romney may need an exceptionally strong close to overcome the president in the electoral college. The overwhelming majority of polls show Obama with a modest but stable lead in critical swing states, most notably Ohio, and other potentially decisive states like Virginia and Colorado remain tossups at best.

At some point, early Wednesday morning, when Gov. Mitt Romney and family were tucked into bed, a quiet call went out on the radio channel used by his Secret Service agents: "Javelin, Jockey details, all posts, discontinue." Of all the indignities involved in losing a presidential race, none is more stark than the sudden emptiness of your entourage. The Secret Service detail guarding Governor Romney since Feb 1. stood down quickly. He had ridden in a 15-car motorcade to the Intercontinental Hotel in Boston for his concession speech. He rode in a single-car motorcade back across the Charles River to Belmont. His son, Tagg, did the driving. There is no formal guideline for the Secret Service agents in this situation; it's up to the discretion of the detail leader, who usually consults with the local police to make sure that his protectee's home won't be overrun by protestors and supporters all of a sudden. But the Service leaves quickly. No more motorcades. No more rope lines. No more bubbles. Familiar faces disappear, never to be seen again. In 2008, agents offered to see John McCain back to his ranch in Sedona, but McCain insisted on saying his good byes in his suite at the Biltmore Hotel. The next morning, McCain was seen driving his own car to get groceries.Had Romney won, everything would have been different. A full counter-assault team, "Hawkeye Javelin," was on stand-by in Boston, ready to supplement his detail. A team from the White House Communications Agency, which had been consulting with his informal transition team on secure space for intelligence briefings, was on hand too. Romney has his family. When the race was close, agents would joke about the number of "j" words they'd need to come up with in order to give every one of his children, their wives, and all of their children code names. That's 29 people who would have received, if not protection, at least a protective survey and recommendations from the Service. Quietly, plans had already been put in place to assign protective details to all of them, just in case. The Secret Service has had a hellish year. Not only has it been the busiest ever for the small agency, but it has been their most embarrassing since the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981. April's prostitution in scandal in Cartegana, Colombia threatened to demoralize the entity in charge of safeguarding the democratic process right on the eve of their active phase; two conventions, major foreign trips for the president, the presidential debates, the United Nations General Assembly, the campaign season itself (with sometimes more than a thousand agents and officers changing locations daily). An Inspector General's report has concluded that agents did not jeopardize the president's safety, but having spent time with agents over these past few months, their morale has been flagging. The public mockery takes it toll, even on silent soldiers. And yet, for everything they were confronted with, the Service did its job. Protectees were protected 100 percent of the time. Several assassination plots were nipped in the bud. Thousands of events were secured, perfectly. Results matter, as we learned Tuesday night. Though no one in the Service was rooting one way or the other for any particular candidate, at least not to colleagues or publicly, not having to secure the Romney family means that agents who have been working 12 hours shifts for eight weeks straight can take some time off before the inauguration. Families of many more agents will get them home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

The first worker asked a question that every voter who is thinking about voting Republican should ask him/herself. The Sensata worker wanted to ask Romney, “If transferring wealth to the top two percent creates jobs, wouldn’t we be swimming in jobs?”Other Sensata workers called Romney the Devil’s twin brother, urged him to save their jobs, and told him to just be honest. Voters should consider the story of Sensata a big screaming siren trying to warn them about what they can expect from a potential Romney presidency.Mitt Romney has always been about making money. Romney’s entire career has put profit over the middle class.Ed Schultz’s broadcast from Freeport, IL was a rare hour of cable news television devoted to the impact of outsourcing, but the key question that Republicans have never been able to answer remains if tax cuts for the wealthy create jobs, where are the jobs?Romney has tried to dodge this question by claiming that his tax plan does not cut taxes for the wealthy, but his lie is laughable, and is now being openly mocked by President Obama as Romnesia.Republicans like Mitt Romney keep coming to voters and telling them that just like Linus waiting for The Great Pumpkin, if we all truly believe that the jobs will come after we cut taxes for the rich, they will rise up out of the pumpkin patch of employment, and bless us with tens of millions of new jobs.The reality is that the jobs didn’t come when the George W. Bush cut taxes for the wealthy. They still didn’t come when Obama was ransomed into extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and we’ll still be waiting for them if Romney wins, and signs off on an even larger tax cut for the rich.Sensata is a warning to every working person in this country. Don’t listen to Romney’s words, look at his deeds, and echo that Sensata worker’s question to Mitt Romney. If cutting taxes for the “job creators” creates jobs, where are they?

WASHINGTON -- Conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol said Sunday the Republican Party should accept new ideas, including the much-criticized suggestion by Democrats that taxes be allowed to go up on the wealthy."It won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "It really won't, I don't think. I don't really understand why Republicans don't take Obama's offer.""Really? The Republican Party is going to fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic and half of whom live in Hollywood and are hostile?" he asked.One of the biggest fights as Congress returns will be over taxes, as cuts put in place by former President George W. Bush are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans want to extend those tax cuts for all income brackets, while Democrats want to raise revenue by allowing them to expire for wealthy Americans.Exit polls last week found that six in ten voters supported ending the tax cuts on the wealthy, but House Republicans have remained adamantly opposed to allowing any of the rates to expire, instead supporting other changes to the tax code. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) indicated on Friday that was unlikely to change."By lowering rates and cleaning up the tax code, we know that we're going to get more economic growth," he said at a press conference. "It'll bring jobs back to America. It'll bring more revenue. We also know that if we clean up the code and make it simpler, the tax code will be more efficient. The current code only collects about 85 percent of what's due the government. And it's clear that if you have a simpler, cleaner, fairer tax code, that efficiency -- the effectiveness and efficiency of the tax code increases exponentially."

COLUMBUS, Ohio — With a bill stripping funding from Planned Parenthood expected to move and other abortion-related legislation in the mix, abortion-rights supporters joined female Democratic lawmakers Tuesday to tell Republicans to back off."Ohio does not want to turn the clock backward and hand over to politicians the personal medical decisions that belong to a woman, her family, and her faith in consultation with her health care provider," Stephanie Kight, Ohio CEO of Planned Parenthood, said at a Statehouse news conference. "Put aside this vendetta against Planned Parenthood and put women's health care first," she added.GOP lawmakers are expected to push forward Wednesday by passing a bill out of a House committee that would shift about $2 million in federal funding for Planned Parenthood to other community health centers around the state. Planned Parenthood has a budget of $24 million. The federal funds cannot be used for abortions.And more abortion-related legislation could be on the horizon, including the so-called heartbeat bill, a ban on all abortions once a heartbeat can be detected in the fetus.That legislation has been stalled in the Ohio Senate while anti-abortion groups try to unite behind the proposal, but could have fresh momentum if a deal is struck during the Ohio legislature's lame duck session.While abortion-rights supporters have said the funding shift will hurt women's access to health care across the state, supporters of the legislation dispute this point.Michael Gonidakis, head of Ohio Right to Life, said the $2 million will flow instead to more than 130 women's health centers including many that are better-equipped to help women handle their health care needs.For example, Gonidakis said, in Sen. Nina Turner's urban Cleveland district, that federal money would go to as many as 13 community health centers instead of five Planned Parenthood centers. He said the community health centers provide prenatal care and have mammogram machines while the Planned Parenthood centers do not."When you peel back the rhetoric, it's a night-and-day difference between the rhetoric and what the reality really is," Gonidakis said.Turner, who wore a pink T-shirt with "GOP, Get Out of my Panties" on it, said the comparisons that Gonidakis draws in her district completely miss the point."Who made them judge and jury over where women chose to go? Whether they live in urban areas or rural areas women should have a right to choose where to go. Period," Turner said. "And Planned Parenthood should be among those choices. They are trying to be slick here and trying to pit the community health centers against Planned Parenthood, but we see right through that."Longtime pediatrician Grant Morrow, who spoke at the news conference, said the funding shift is political payback from anti-abortion Republicans to Planned Parenthood for providing abortions."It's a political agenda, it's not a bill to provide a system of non-judgmental health care to Ohioans," he said.

Yesterday, we noted that even as a massive super storm was bearing down on the East Coast, Mitt Romney’s campaign was standing by his suggestion in a GOP debate last year that he would end FEMA and make the states handle disaster relief on their own. But how much has changed in 24 hours. As we wake up to see the disaster Hurricane Sandy had wrought, we also find a new position for Romney, who now says he wants to keep FEMA.In a GOP primary debate in June of last year, moderator John King asked Romney if he would let states take on the responsibilities of FEMA, which was “about to run out of money.” “Absolutely,” Romney replied. “And every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that’s the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that’s even better … We cannot — we cannot afford to do those things,” he added.After the Huffington Post highlighted the quote Sunday under the headline, “Mitt Romney in GOP Debate: Shut Down Federal Disaster Agency, Send Responsibility to the States,” a spokesperson for the Romney campaign followed up with editor Ryan Grim. Did the spokesperson say Grim’s characterization of Romney’s comments was wrong? Nope. “Gov. Romney wants to ensure states, who are the first responders and are in the best position to aid impacted individuals and communities, have the resources and assistance they need to cope with natural disasters,” was all the unnamed Romney official said.As we noted yesterday, eliminating the federal component of disaster relief is a terrible idea. And after Hurricane Sandy has left millions suffering, the Romney campaign seems to have come around. “Gov. Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions. As the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA,” Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement to Politico’s Andrew Restuccia.It’s worth noting that what Williams describes is basically exactly the way emergency management functions now, though he curiously left out any mention of local and municipal responders, who are really in the best position to affect aid. When locals get overwhelmed, they bring in state resources. When state resources get overwhelmed, they bring in federal resources. As FEMA explains about the National Incident Management System, the national standardized process that various tiers of government used to work together in emergencies:  “NIMS does not take command away from state and local authorities … The intention of the federal government in these situations is not to command the response but, rather, to support the affected local, tribal, and/or state governments.” There is a valid, though wonky, critique to be made of the current system of cost allocation between states and Washington. When the president declares a federal disaster area, the federal government commits to paying for 75 percent of the recovery effort. A report from the Government Accountability Office this year found that the formula used to determine whether states can handle the financial burdens of disasters on their own has not adequately kept up with inflation and increases in household incomes. So the federal government ends up taking on financial obligation that states could and should afford on their own. Changing the way the threshold is calculated would save the federal government lots of money, but that’s not at all what Mitt Romney was talking about. He was making an ideological argument, not an accounting one. And by coming back around to support basically the status quo, it’s hard to see his position on FEMA as anything but another flip-flop.

Two Republicans in separate states were taken into police custody during the past week for allegedly attempting to test how easy it would be to commit voter fraud.In Nevada, 56-year-old Roxanne Rubin, a Republican, was arrested on Nov. 2 for allegedly trying to vote twice, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The newspaper quoted a report by an investigator with the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office that said Rubin “was unhappy with the process; specifically in that her identification was not checked.”Rubin allegedly voted at one polling location in Henderson, Nev. on Oct. 29 and then went to another voting location in Las Vegas to try to vote again. Poll workers told her records indicated she had already voted, but Rubin allegedly told them she hadn’t. A poll worker reportedly overheard Rubin tell another man that she had “signed my name differently, and they did not ask for ID.” She was arrested at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and charged with a category “D” felony.On Tuesday in New Mexico, a Republican poll watcher was taken into police custody after also apparently trying to test the system. According to the Las Cruces Sun-News, the man voted, then obtained a second provisional ballot and announced he was simply “testing the system to see if people could get away with voting twice.”Santa Clara, N.M. Police Chief Lonnie Sandoval told TPM the suspect’s name would not be released because the investigation was ongoing. He expected to complete the investigation by today and send the report to the district attorney, who would ultimately decide whether to bring charges.“From what we understand, he was trained by the Republican Party,” Sandoval told TPM. The Grant County Republican Party did not respond to a request for comment.County Clerk Robert Zamarripa told TPM he and his employees had never seen such an incident before but said it wouldn’t sour his office’s relationship with poll watchers.“The Republican Party chairwoman from this county handled it accordingly,” Zamarripa said. “We’ve always worked well together, so I don’t think it would cause any problems whatsoever.” Zamarripa said he was told the individual only recently began attending the Republican Party’s meetings and wasn’t well known by the organization’s leaders.

see more posts by Candace TalmadgeInternet evangelist Bill Keller is urging the faithful to promise to vote for Jesus for president in this election.So far, his website, VotingforJesus.com, says it has more than 1.6 million pledges to write in the name of Jesus on their ballots instead of any other presidential candidate.If even half of those who signed the pledge vote accordingly, this could signal real trouble for Mitt Romney in close races by reducing the pool of voters who usually opt for the GOP.But Keller, in an email interview, argues otherwise. “A large percentage of the people signed up are part of the 9 million self-identified evangelicals who never voted at all in 2008,” he maintains. “While they will write in the name of Jesus for president, they will also vote for men and women who share their faith values down ticket. It is flawed logic that if you don’t vote for Romney, you are costing him votes or helping Obama. The only way to vote for either man is to vote for them.”Keller also notes that those who signed the pledge “seem very serious and happy to have an outlet to take a stand for their faith.” He adds that the point of writing in Jesus’s name is not that he will win, but that the exercise offers those who pledge a chance “to take a stand for their faith by writing in the name of Jesus, to bring awareness that the real problems in this nation are NOT political, they are spiritual.”How much impact this effort will have on the outcome at any level is anybody’s guess until the votes are counted and the exit polls analyzed the every last morsel of meaning.It is clear right now, however, that Keller, who claims an audience of more than 2.4 million for his daily religious messages, has the ability to influence the actions of millions of them at least to the extent of making a promise on how they will vote.Other conservative Christians have noticed and taken Keller to task for it, even going so far as to redirect a search for .org version of Keller’s VotingforJesus.com web address to a website where they argue that Keller’s pledge will take votes away from Republican candidate Mitt Romney.It’s a fascinating glimpse into this year’s split between uber-right Christian voters who previously have cast their ballots pretty much in lock-step for GOP candidates like George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. This year, with a Mormon the GOP standard-bearer, a significant proportion of these once reliable voters are not having any of it.Yet few mainstream commentators are willing to tackle out loud the subject of religious bigotry’s influence on election outcomes. After all, doesn’t Billy Graham’s endorsement of Mitt Romney mean that religious conservatives pretty much have accepted the latter as the Republican most likely to win?Keller, who condemned Graham’s acceptance of Romney, disagrees in fiery rhetoric that he wields unsparingly. “On every major spiritual issue of the day, President Obama has proved to be an enemy of God and a true tool of Satan!” he writes on the home page of VotingforJesus.com.Of Obama’s GOP opponent, he declares, “If Mitt Romney is elected, he will be the fulfillment of his cult’s polygamist, pedophile, racist, con artist, murdering founder Joseph Smith’s ‘White Horse’ prophecy that Romney and all Mormons believe.”Virulently anti-gay, anti-Muslim, anti-Mormon and more, Keller spent time in federal prison after being convicted of insider trading. His organization, St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Bill Keller Ministries, has been branded a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he has threatened with a defamation lawsuit.Keller represents the extreme wing of conservative Christian political activists. The rest of us ignore or discount him and them at our peril, because they have deadly serious political ambitions backed by deep pockets and clout.

Mitt romney has made Obama's out-of-context “you didn't build that” quote a central theme of his campaign. It's ironic, as Mitt Romney is going to profit just before the election when Bain-owned Sensata Technologies moves 170 high-tech jobs from Freeport, Illinois, to a plant in China built for the firm by the Chinese government.Sensata enjoyed record revenues last year – this isn't about making the “hard choices” necessary to save a failing enterprise. The workers in Freeport have been working 24 hours a day, in three shifts. They make $14-17 per hour, with benefits.According to a report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, one of Bain's first actions after buying Sensata was to set up “12 Sensata/Bain capital funds 'organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands' so as to avoid paying taxes.” They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and then use those offshore funds to defer taxes on some of the income the company generates.American tax-payers, on the other hand, have paid $780,000 to retrain some of Sensata's laid off workers in Illinois, according to the New York Times. One would be hard pressed to come up with a clearer example of capturing private gains while socializing the costs.Mitt Romney is not directly involved in Bain Capital, but he did build its business model. In 1998, when he was actively running Bain, he personally visited the Global-Tech Appliances plant in Dongguan, China. He witnessed, personally, the horrific conditions the plant's workers were toiling in for .24 cents an hour, and didn't hesitate to invest millions in the firm.We've heard a lot about the workers in Freeport. But on this week's AlterNet Radio Hour, I spoke with Charles  Kernaghan, director of the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, about what life is like for the Chinese workers in Sensata's existing Chinese plants. The podcast below is about 20 minutes long – give it a listen.

Coal miners will fare better if President Barack Obama is re-elected, as opponent Mitt Romney doesn’t understand the “nature of hard work,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said.“President Obama stands head and shoulders above Mitt Romney when it comes to protecting the lives of coal miners and giving them a future,” Trumka, a former coal miner who heads the largest U.S. labor federation, said today on a conference call.Trumka’s narrative is at odds with Romney’s warnings to coal miners that a second Obama administration will lead to tougher regulations and fewer mining jobs.Obama “has gone so far as to impose regulations designed to bankrupt the coal industry,” according to Romney’s website.The number of coal jobs in the U.S. is half what it was 30 years ago. Some of those that remain are clustered in rural enclaves in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia that both candidates see as critical to winning the White House, which has made coal a prominent election issue.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Obama plans to phase in limits on industrial emissions of carbon dioxide through 2016. The rules stem from a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the EPA had authority to regulate greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane under the Clean Air Act.The case was initiated by Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully to succeed Romney as governor in 2006. Eleven other states were among petitioners in the case.“Those EPA regulations were ordered by the Supreme Court as a result of a lawsuit by Mitt Romney while he was governor,” Trumka said. “If there is a war on coal, it starts and ends with Mitt Romney.”Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman, said the Massachusetts attorney general is elected by voters, “is independent of governor’s office and makes his or her own decisions regarding the Commonwealth’s legal strategy.”In 2008, about 48 percent of U.S. electricity came from coal. In August, that total had slipped to 38 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. Coal is losing its place as the mainstay in power generation to increased production of natural gas as a result of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which has driven down prices for natural gas to their lowest levels in 10 years.Trumka also praised Obama for better enforcement of coal- mine regulations through the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.To contact the reporter on this story: Jim Efstathiou Jr. in New York at jefstathiou@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net

A Burlington County, New Jersey, jury acquitted longtime marijuana legalization and First Amendment gadfly Ed Forchion, better known as the NJ Weedman, on charges he possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute last Thursday after he told jurors he needed marijuana for medicine and that they had the right to vote to acquit him despite the facts in the case.The facts in the case seemed like a slam-dunk for the prosecution. The Weedman got caught with a pound of pot in his car after being stopped by a state trooper two years ago in Mount Holly and admitted it. People caught with that amount of marijuana (and even much smaller amounts) are routinely charged -- and convicted -- of possession with intent to distribute. During the three-day trial, Assistant Prosecutor Michael Luciano told the jury New Jersey law prohibited the possession of large amounts of marijuana and it should easily convict Forchion. "It's straightforward," Luciano said. But Forchion, who now resides in California and holds a California medical marijuana card, argued that New Jersey's marijuana laws conflicted with its medical marijuana law, which was approved before he was arrested. The Weedman ran into trouble with Superior Court Judge Charles Delehey, though, when he brought up jury nullification -- the argument that jurors are free to vote as they wish despite the facts in the case. When Forchion brought up jury nullification, Delehey stopped him, warning that he could be held in criminal contempt if he continued. Delehey also told jurors they were to decide the case only on the facts, not on what they think of the law. In his summation, prosecutor Luciano echoed the judge, asking jurors to not use their verdict to show their "opinion on the war on drugs." The jury deliberated for two hours before coming back with a unanimous not guilty verdict. "I'm not a weirdo anymore, I'm a hero," a jubilant Weedman told supporters and reporters after the verdict. "Other patients should start using the Weedman defense." The case was a retrial. In his original trial stemming from the traffic stop, the jury convicted him of simple marijuana possession, but was unable to reach a verdict on the more serious charge of possession with intent to distribute. Forchion said he will appeal the possession conviction. Forchion's courtroom antics also included telling the jury he was eating marijuana-infused cookies while he delivered his summation and asking Judge Delehey to order his "medicine" returned in the case of a not guilty verdict. Delehey refused, saying it was "contraband." Prosecutors had no comment after the jury's decision.

Mitt Romney's current standing in the polls in Massachusetts gives him the dubious honor of being more unpopular in his home state than any presidential candidate in modern history.A look back at 50 years of elections in the US shows that if he wins on November 6 Romney would become the first president of modern times to be elected despite losing the popular vote in his home state.Romney, who was governor of Massachusetts just six years ago, now trails Obama by over 17 points in recent polls there.Voting trends going back to 1960, when John F Kennedy – who like Romney had a background in Massachusetts politics – show that the winner of the presidential election has always won the state where they served in political office.The story is largely the same with the losing presidential candidates. Only two in the Guardian's sample of 13 elections have failed to win their states – Al Gore in 2000 and George McGovern in 1972.But Romney's projected performance in Massachusetts, if accurate, will still stand out from those two candidates. Polls conducted in October show Romney behind Obama by 17.4 points in the state, much worse than either Gore or McGovern fared in their home states.Gore, who served as a Democratic congressman and later senator for Tennessee before serving as Bill Clinton's vice-president, lost the popular vote in his state, by 51.15% to 47.28% – 3.87 points. He lost the election to George W Bush as well, despite famously winning the popular vote.George McGovern, a Democratic senator from South Dakota, lost the popular vote in his state to Richard Nixon by 54.15% to 45.52%, or 8.63 points. He lost the presidential election too, in a massive landslide.The thing the three have in common is that their home states, at the time of their elections, trend towards the opposite party, but even so Romney would hope to be closer in the state where he has spent his entire adult life and where he was governor until 2007.Romney grew up in Michigan before studying at Stanford university in California for a year. He then spent two years in France as a Mormon missionary before returning to study at Brigham Young University in Utah. The future Republican nominee moved to Massachusetts in 1971 to attend Harvard, and after graduating in 1975 moved into consultancy in Boston, where he spent the majority of his career.Romney spent five years as a bishop within the Mormon church in Massachusetts in the 1980s, and ran for senate in the state in 1994. He was elected Massachusetts governor in 2002 and served for a single term before resigning to run for president in 2008.Looking west to Michigan, where Romney spent his formative years and where his father George was a popular three-term governor, it still looks negative. The most recent Rasmussen poll in Michigan shows Obama with support from 52% of likely voters, while 45% plan to vote for Romney.On the cheerier side, Romney does have a chance of winning New Hampshire, where he has a summer home, and will almost certainly triumph in his undergraduate home of Utah.

see more posts by Sarah JonesOn CNN this morning, Jim Acosta reported that Mitt Romney refused to answer questions about his support for Richard Mourdock while campaigning in Ohio today.ACOSTA: There’s been a distraction for this campaign over the last 24 hours and has to do with Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, who made the controversial comments about abortion and rape at that debate and Mitt Romney was silent on this matter yesterday, his campaign advisers were not really seen around the press corps when we tried to talk to them about this yesterday and earlier this morning he made a stop at a breakfast shop here in Cincinnati. He was asked again by reporters about this matter. He did not respond to those questions. And of course all of this is an issue for Mitt Romney because he just taped an ad for Richard Mourdock just in the last couple of weeks for that Senate candidate’s campaign. And so far, the Romney campaign says they are standing behind their support for Richard Mourdock and they’re not asking him to pull that ad.Even Haley Barbour says Mourdock’s comments are “kinda crazy”, but the Romney camp is still standing by their man Mourdock, even after he said that rape was God’s will and the result a “gift”.I wrote earlier that Mitt Romney was beginning to appear very weak as this issue continues to mushroom in the media, and his refusal to answer questions about it only solidifies the candidate as one who refuses to take a leadership role within his own party.If Romney can’t lead his party, why would anyone think he can lead the country?The truth is that Mourdock’s comments didn’t offend Mitt Romney, and he’s so out of touch that he doesn’t realize how they impact women. Binders full of rape courtesy of God’s will is just a part of Romney’s worldview at this point.I still can’t understand why Mitt Romney chose Richard Mourdock of all senate candidates to cut an ad for in the general election. But the fact that Romney is too afraid of the Right to ask Mourdock to take down the ad (that even Joe Scarborough thinks Romney should demand be taken down) is telling.This is more evidence of the Fox bubble Mitt Romney lives in. He doesn’t get it. He believes that most Americans think the way the fringe on the right thinks – and they don’t. While Romney is a weak appeaser on many things, from the stories I’ve read about his treatment of women as a Bishop, it appears that in this case Romney actually secretly agrees with Mourdock. Geoffrey Dunn details Romney shaming a young Mormon woman whose doctor had indicated that she needed to have a potentially life saving abortion, “According to R. B. Scott, author of the insightful Mitt Romney: An Inside Look at the Man and His Politics, Romney’s only concern was for the unborn fetus.”In the past, Mitt Romney treated women with less care and respect than he treated his family dog. I haven’t seen anything to indicate that he’s had an awakening. If anything, his binders full of women and “if” a woman is going to work comments along with his cluelessness about how offensive Mourdock’s comments are to women are a frightening confirmation of how Mitt Romney views a woman’s place in America.In contrast, last night President Obama was on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and he said, to much applause, “Rape is rape and it’s a crime.”

Democrat Colleen M. Lachowicz beat Republican incumbent Thomas H. Martin Jr. by 913 votes Tuesday in the race for Senate District 25. Lachowicz defeated Martin 8,666 to 7,753. She won only one community in the district, Waterville, but by a commanding 4,224 to 2,318 vote. Martin took all the others. He won in Winslow 2,007 to 1,921; in Pittsfield 990-702; in Detroit 179-163; in Clinton 837-705; in Benton 824-579; and in Albion 598-372. Lachowicz, 48, a social worker and clinical supervisor for Kennebec Behavioral Health, was celebrating late Tuesday with friends, family members, supporters and volunteers at Post Office Square in downtown Waterville. “This started a long time ago because I realized there were things that needed to be fixed,” Lachowicz said. “I thank every voter and all the volunteers. I’m just so grateful. And all the people around the world -- thank you.” Martin, 47, who held the senate seat two years, is co-owner of Nitram Excavation & General Contractors Inc., of Benton. The race drew international attention twice in a week earlier this fall when the state Republican Party created a website and mailed out flyers criticizing Lachowicz for engaging in a fantasy online game and making “crude, vicious and violent online comments”; as well as and when the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee called the race one of the key battlegrounds in legislative races across the country. Lachowicz said after the Republican attacks that she thought Mainers saw the “political stunt” as bullying and that is why she received an outpouring of support for her campaign following the controversy. She said it provided additional motivation for her and her supporters to keep talking with voters. Martin said he had nothing to do with the flyers and did not learn until after the fact that they were being distributed. He said he emailed Lachowicz after the attacks and assured her they did not come from him. But both Martin and David Sorensen, spokesman for the Maine Republican Party, said they believed the attack on Lachowicz was not simply about her gaming, but also about comments she made online about how she was losing productivity and being lazy at her job, which is partially funded by taxes, because she was engaging in gaming. Last week, after a complaint was filed by the Maine Republican Party, the state Ethics Commission ruled that Lachowicz would not face an investigation into her fundraising activities. Lachowicz ran her campaign on the promise that she would help create jobs and improve the economy -- which she cited as two of the most important issues facing the state. The former chairman of the Waterville City Democratic Committee and former vice chairman of the Kennebec County Democratic Committee said the people of Maine are underemployed and have not been able to find jobs, and families are suffering. She also said she is a big supporter of education that will help prepare people for jobs and she supports investing in efforts that will bring jobs to Maine.Colleen Lachowicz, Democratic candidate for Senate District 25, center, reacts after her husband Ed announced that she beat opponent Tom Martin in Waterville on Tuesday.

Papa John's CEO John Schnatter’s recent statement that the Affordable Care Act will force the pizza chain to raise prices came as good news to Nick Martin.Martin, a part owner of Ian’s Pizza, a pizza shop with four locations in Wisconsin, said his business has offered full heath care coverage to its 50 full-time employees for years, making it all the more difficult to compete with national chains like Papa John's that pay workers low wages without health benefits."This may level the playing field for us,” Martin said of the Papa John's price hike. “If they have to pay for benefits, and that pushes their prices up closer to ours, it will justify what we’ve been paying for and what we’ve been fighting to do the past few years.” (Ian's knows a bit about fighting, having fed demonstrators free slices during last year's protests in Madison.)Like many of the 60 percent of small businesses that pay employees health benefits, Ian's Pizza has struggled to compete with national chains that enter local markets and undercut existing prices. But Obamacare may give local businesses some breathing room as national chains lose the advantage they once wielded through not providing health insurance, according to Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Obamacare mandates that businesses with more than 50 workers offer an approved insurance plan or pay a penalty of $2,000 for each full-time worker over 30. “Evidence suggests that when health insurance costs go up, worker wages fall, rather than prices going up,” Gruber said. “If firms are forced to give their workers health insurance, they generally react by paying workers less in wages; they don’t raise the price of goods."However, in the case of Papa John's, a portion of its employees are already paid at minimum wage, Gruber pointed out. "So you can’t reduce wages for those employees, and the firm may have to increase prices a little bit,” he said.But Gruber emphasized that such price hikes will likely be small, meaning local business owners shouldn’t expect their prices to become that much more competitive compared to the big guys."A lot of what drives statements like those of Papa John’s CEO are politics, not economics," Gruber said.Schnatter, a Romney supporter who held a fundraiser for the former Republican nominee, said in August that Obamacare would cost the company between 11 and 14 cents per pizza. Subsequent analysis by Caleb Melby of Forbes found that the price increase would actually be closer 3.4 to 3.6 cents per pie.“It’s not going to have much of an effect on the gap in prices between Papa John's and smaller competitors,” Gruber said. “That gap is much more about the efficiencies that come from being a large operator, being able to buy in bulk and things like that.”Still, small business owners who already offer employees health insurance reported feeling a sense of vindication upon hearing that large restaurant chains are now being forced to consider a cost that they’ve shouldered for years.“I’d tell Papa John's' CEO, ‘Welcome to the club,’” Martin said. “We’ve battled the whole way giving health insurance to employees ever since we could afford to do it 9 years ago, as a two-year-old business.”

It appears that Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, is on a mission to suppress Ohio voters. During the weeks leading up to Election Day, Husted has tried everything he can come up with, even defying court orders, in order to make sure that fewer people can vote early, and now get their vote counted. A last minute directive issued by Husted could now invalidate many legal provisional ballots.Widely viewed as the most critical state for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, Ohio could swing the entire election if the 11th hour mandate stands.Issued on Friday, the directive lays out the requirements for submitting a provisional ballot. The directive includes a form that puts the burden on the voter to correctly record the form of ID provided to election officials, and Husted instructed election officials not to count ballots if the form is not filled out correctly by a voter.Voting rights advocates filed a lawsuit late Friday, stating that this is "contrary to a court decision on provisional ballots a week ago and contrary to statements made by attorneys for Husted at an Oct. 24 court hearing."Husted directive also appears to be in violation of Ohio law. The lawsuit states:Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.181(B)(6) provides that, once a voter casting a provisional ballot proffers identification, “the appropriate local election official shall record the type of identification provided, the social security number information, the fact that the affirmation was executed, or the fact that the individual declined to execute such an affirmation and include that information with the transmission of the ballot . . . .”Ohio law also “ensures that any questions regarding a voter’s identification are resolved on the spot or, consistent with due process, the voter is informed that he or she needs to provide additional information to the board of elections. This protects the integrity of the voting process, and provides a reasonable opportunity to resolve deficiencies.”Husted's last minute directive changes this and puts the burden on the voter, which greatly increases the chances that legal provisional ballots will be discarded.The court has given Husted until Monday to respond to the lawsuit, and said that it would resolve the dispute before provisional ballots are counted on November 17.

see more posts by Jason EasleyOn Meet The Press, Chuck Todd debunked Romney’s Pennsylvania spin by pointing out that the Republican is going there because he is losing in Ohio and Wisconsin.Here is the video:Todd broke down the map as it currently stands, “He could lose Ohio, Iowa, and Pennsylvania and he could get there. The problem is, Wisconsin is looking like a state, it’s a same day voter registration state. So then if you look at it that way, he needs one of these others. In Ohio, if you believe the two-point race there, that would put him over. So that’s why, what explains if you will, David, why Romney is going to Pennsylvania because if you only — if you take away Pennsylvania, he’s only got two routes and Ohio and Wisconsin both seem to be a little where he’s behind.”The media is seeing through the Romney campaign’s spin, and starting to move away from the toss up/it could go either way talking points that GOP desperately needs to keep alive through election day. The reality is that Romney has not made up any ground in Wisconsin or Ohio. This does not mean that those states are out of play, or that President Obama has the election locked up. It does mean that Romney is behind in critical states on the final weekend before the election.Romney knows he is losing. Despite conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife trying to provide him political cover for his trip into Pennsylvania by claiming that the state is too close to call, the reality is that Mitt Romney isn’t coming to Pennsylvania because it is a swing state.He is going to be campaigning there because he wagered all of his chips on Ohio, and so far, that bet isn’t looking like a winner.The Romney campaign was able to fool a desperately wanting-to-be-fooled media for weeks with their Romentum talk after the first presidential debate, but with less than two days before voters will cast their ballots, the numbers tell a story of a close election that is moving towards the incumbent.The media has caught on to the poison narrative that the Romney campaign is desperately trying to spin away. When someone as inside the Beltway as Chuck Todd says he is losing, Romney’s not only losing votes. He is also losing the media battle.It is important to remember that elections aren’t held after the first presidential debate, or on the the weekend before. Presidential elections are held on the first Tuesday in November. The only polls that count are the ones where voters are and will be casting their ballots.If you want this polling and momentum to become a reality, you must go vote.

It’s 3:00 a.m. on November 7, 2012.With the painfully close presidential election now down to who wins the battleground state of Ohio, no network dares to call the race and risk repeating the mistakes of 2000 when a few networks jumped the gun on picking a winner.As the magic boards used by the networks go ‘up close and personal’ on every county in the Buckeye State, word begins to circulate that there might be a snafu with some electronic voting machines in a number of Cincinnati based precincts. There have already been complaints that broken machines were not being quickly replaced in precincts that tend to lean Democratic and now, word is coming in that there may be some software issues.The network political departments get busy and, in short order, discover that the machines used in Hamilton County, Ohio—the county home of Cincinnati— are supplied by Hart Intercivic, a national provider of voting systems in use in a wide variety of counties scattered throughout the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Colorado and Ohio.A quick Internet search reveals that there may be reason for concern.A test conducted in 2007 by the Ohio Secretary of State revealed that five of the electronic voting systems the state was looking to use in the upcoming 2008 presidential election had failed badly, each easily susceptible to chicanery that could alter the results of an election.As reported in the New York Times, “At polling stations, teams working on the study were able to pick locks to access memory cards and use hand-held devices to plug false vote counts into machines. At boards of election, they were able to introduce malignant software into servers.”We learn that one of the companies whose machines had failed was none other than Hart Intercivic.With television time to fill and no ability to declare a winner so that the long night’s broadcast can be brought to a close, the staffs keep digging for relevant information to keep the attention of their viewers—and that is when it gets very real.It turns out that Hart Intercivic is owned, in large part, by H.I.G. Capital—a large investment fund with billions of dollars under management—that was founded by a fellow named Tony Tamer. While is is unclear just how much H.I.G. owns of Hart Intercivic, we do learn that H.I.G. employees hold at least two of the five Hart Intercivic board seats.(continued on next page-Update included on Page 3)

A recent auto accident bruised Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's ribs, but it hasn't prevented him from punching at the opposition as Campaign 2012 enters its final week.After an editorial board meeting with Review-Journal sister publication El Tiempo Spanish-language newspaper, in which Reid vilified Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney as a "plastic man" who has changed his position on major issues so often he can't be trusted, the senator wondered aloud whether the race for the White House can be purchased by a small group of wealthy businessmen."The problem is this," Reid said. "My concern is that Karl Rove and 17 angry old white men are trying to buy the election. And that's the truth. You have (Las Vegas Sands casino billionaire Sheldon) Adelson, the Koch brothers (billionaires David and Charles). You have (billionaire Harold) Simmons of Texas. They are literally trying to buy the election. Think about this. The day after the election, Karl Rove sits down and talks to ? the 17 angry old white guys and says, 'Hey, listen guys, we just bought America. And we're still rich.' That's the concern that we all have."Right now I'm guessing some Republicans wish the accident had rendered Reid speechless until well after Nov. 6. No such luck.Reid's discussion with the editors of El Tiempo is yet another reminder of the importance to the Democrats of firing up the Latino vote in Nevada and elsewhere. Not only does it speak to the growing political clout of that demographic, but it also may be the only way Obama campaign can outrun its problems with blue-collar voters hurt by high unemployment and a battered housing market.It shouldn't exactly be a hard sell in the Latin community. During the Republican presidential primary, a list of contenders, Romney not least among them, took turns trying to see who could talk tougher on the immigration issue. Most delivered criticism of the Obama administration's push for the DREAM Act, which would give the undocumented a path to citizenship but has stalled along party lines in Congress.If the president can be criticized for failing to act more decisively in the immigration issue, he can't be blamed for claiming the undocumented from Mexico would "self-deport," as Romney has said.The immigration issue, Reid argued, is one of many examples of where Romney has been on both sides of issues: An anti-immigration hawk in February coos almost like a DREAM Act dove as the election approaches."Romney has said the DREAM Act, if it were law, he'd veto it," Reid said.During the interview, Reid heralded the potential of renewable energy for Nevada and took time to thump the Review-Journal's conservative editorial policies. (The senator met with El Tiempo editors, but declined to spend time with the R-J.)Reid's message was clear: Republicans have let down Latinos and are paying the price at the polls."I think that if this election turns out the way I want it to, I think you'll see Republicans running to see what they can do for the Hispanic community," he said. "Because the hell is being beaten out of them every place as a result of what they haven't done."Meanwhile, it appears clear the president believes he still has work to do in Nevada. Obama is scheduled to return Thursday to Las Vegas, a political stage he has played in recent months more than Tony Bennett. The fact the president is coming back once more before Election Day is circumstantial evidence that the battle for the Battle Born state isn't decided."We have several places that are very close," Reid allowed.As Obama's fiercest defender, Reid's sore ribs will be closer to healed by then.Whether his rhetoric has sufficiently bruised the opposition's ribs will be known on the first Tuesday in November.John L. Smith's column appears Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. E-mail him at Smith@reviewjournal.com or call 702-383-0295. He blogs at lvrj.com/blogs/Smith

Citizen concerns about untested software have multiplied since the Columbus Free Press broke the news that Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted's office installed uncertified and untested software on the central vote tabulation machines in up to 39 counties in the state.Memos circulated amongst senior staff at the Ohio Secretary of States' indicate that they consider this skirting of Ohio Election Law is justified because the software does not directly tabulate or communicate actual votes. Their statements to the mainstream press reveal a different set of facts about the software and a different justification.In statements to the theGrio, NBC's political blog, SOS spokesman Matt McClellan said the software is to "assist counties and to help them simplify the process by which they report the results to our system." and that it was deemed experimental because "It is a pilot project that we're doing with about 25 counties or so. So it's not statewide, but it is a pilot project we're trying."Ohio election law does not allow software or hardware to be used in election until it has been tested or certified by the Ohio Board of Voting Machine Examiners unless it is experimental. The confidential internal memos indicate that this software was never tested because of claims that it is not involved with the tabulation or communication of votes. Reporting election results from county tabulation systems to the secretary of state's office, which is the purpose of this software as explained by McClellan, is in fact communication of votes.The potential federal illegality of this software has been hidden from public scrutiny by the Secretary of State's Election Counsel Brandi Seske. In a September 29 memo, Seske wrote, "Please see the attached letter from Matt Masterson regarding de minimis changes - one submitted by ES&S and one by Dominion Voting Systems. He has reviewed and approved the changes." "De minimis" is a legal term for minute. Federal election regulations have a very specific definition of de minimis. This definition was clarified to all state level agencies in a federal Elections Assistance Commission memo dated February 8, 2012 entitled "Software and Firmware modifications are not de minimis changes."Ohio election law provides for experimental equipment only in a limited number of precincts per county. Installing uncertified and untested software on central tabulation equipment essential affects every single precinct in a given county. Nowhere in the memos circulated by Seske, nor in the contract, is the software called "experimental."The Secretary of State's office has given one questionable justification to its own Board of Voting Machine Examiners and another to the public.The contract provides for testing, performed jointly by the counties and the vendor within 30 days of the software being installed. This testing was required to be independent and overseen by the Board of Voting Machine Examiners, as required by Ohio law.McClellan told theGrio "I'm not sure the exact timeline of that [the installation and testing], but I know we've been working with the counties for the past couple of months on getting these in place, testing them to make sure they work properly, and working with the vendors as well."This uncertified and untested software could easily malfunction and corrupt votes on the central tabulation machines, thus destroying any electronic record of the actual votes by citizens. This "experimental" software, as outlined in the contract, has no security protocols. A "man in the middle" attack, like the one that stole the Ohio election for George W. Bush in 2004, could be directly facilitated by this untested and uncertified software installation.The Secretary of State's office has used every legal contortion to avoid the use of science and the possibility of public scrutiny of this possibly illegal software. The Free Press will continue to report on this story as it develops.

The economy is slowly recovering from the 2008 meltdown, and the country could suffer another recession if the wrong policies take hold. The United States is embroiled in unstable regions that could easily explode into full-blown disaster. An ideological assault from the right has started to undermine the vital health reform law passed in 2010. Those forces are eroding women’s access to health care, and their right to control their lives. Nearly 50 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act, all Americans’ rights are cheapened by the right wing’s determination to deny marriage benefits to a selected group of us. Astonishingly, even the very right to vote is being challenged.That is the context for the Nov. 6 election, and as stark as it is, the choice is just as clear.President Obama has shown a firm commitment to using government to help foster growth. He has formed sensible budget policies that are not dedicated to protecting the powerful, and has worked to save the social safety net to protect the powerless. Mr. Obama has impressive achievements despite the implacable wall of refusal erected by Congressional Republicans so intent on stopping him that they risked pushing the nation into depression, held its credit rating hostage, and hobbled economic recovery.Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has gotten this far with a guile that allows him to say whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear. But he has tied himself to the ultraconservative forces that control the Republican Party and embraced their policies, including reckless budget cuts and 30-year-old, discredited trickle-down ideas. Voters may still be confused about Mr. Romney’s true identity, but they know the Republican Party, and a Romney administration would reflect its agenda. Mr. Romney’s choice of Representative Paul Ryan as his running mate says volumes about that.We have criticized individual policy choices that Mr. Obama has made over the last four years, and have been impatient with his unwillingness to throw himself into the political fight. But he has shaken off the hesitancy that cost him the first debate, and he approaches the election clearly ready for the partisan battles that would follow his victory.We are confident he would challenge the Republicans in the “fiscal cliff” battle even if it meant calling their bluff, letting the Bush tax cuts expire and forcing them to confront the budget sequester they created. Electing Mr. Romney would eliminate any hope of deficit reduction that included increased revenues.In the poisonous atmosphere of this campaign, it may be easy to overlook Mr. Obama’s many important achievements, including carrying out the economic stimulus, saving the auto industry, improving fuel efficiency standards, and making two very fine Supreme Court appointments.Mr. Obama has achieved the most sweeping health care reforms since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The reform law takes a big step toward universal health coverage, a final piece in the social contract.It was astonishing that Mr. Obama and the Democrats in Congress were able to get a bill past the Republican opposition. But the Republicans’ propagandistic distortions of the new law helped them wrest back control of the House, and they are determined now to repeal the law.That would eliminate the many benefits the reform has already brought: allowing children under 26 to stay on their parents’ policies; lower drug costs for people on Medicare who are heavy users of prescription drugs; free immunizations, mammograms and contraceptives; a ban on lifetime limits on insurance payments. Insurance companies cannot deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions. Starting in 2014, insurers must accept all applicants. Once fully in effect, the new law would start to control health care costs.

Nate Silver is seen by conservatives as a threat to Republicans this election. It’s not simply because Silver, the statistician behind the New York Times-hosted FiveThirtyEight blog, predicts that President Obama will win the election. Rather, it’s also because Silver is one of the most accurate forecasters out there.Considering how spot on he was in 2008—Silver correctly predicted the results of 49 out of 50 states—that’s bad news for conservatives. Hence, the invective to discredit him. According to the Washington Post’s Ezra Klein:First, there are the conservatives who don’t like Silver’s model because, well, they don’t like it. Obama’s continued strong showing is prima facie evidence of bias. Or, to put it slightly differently, the model must be skewed. The answer to this is simple enough: If Silver’s model is systematically biased, there’s a market opportunity for anyone who wants to build a better model. That person would stand to gain hugely if they outpredicted punditry’s reigning forecaster (not to mention all the betting markets and all the other forecasters). The math behind what Silver is doing isn’t that complicated and the polls are easily available. But so far, the most popular conservative take on the polls was UnskewedPolls.com, to which … LOL. If Silver’s model is so easy to best, then what’s the market failure keeping a less-biased source from besting it?But it’s not just conservatives who are fighting Silver—some in the news media are doing it as well. In fact, as Klein points out, much of that criticism is coming from the political news website Politico, and for good reason:Silver’s work poses a threat to more traditional—and, in particular, to more excitable—forms of political punditry and horse-race journalism. ...If you had to distill the work of a political pundit down to a single question, you’d have to pick the perennial “who will win the election?” During election years, that’s the question at the base of most careers in punditry, almost all cable news appearances, and most A1 news articles. Traditionally, we’ve answered that question by drawing on some combination of experience, intuition, reporting and polls. Now Silver—and Silver’s imitators and political scientists—are taking that question away from us. It would be shocking if the profession didn’t try and defend itself.Silver currently predicts that Obama has roughly a 75 percent chance of winning the election next week. He also forecasts that Obama will win 300 electoral votes to Romney’s 238.More Below the AdIf you have trouble leaving a comment, review this help page. Still having problems? Let us know.

But when heavy fog rolled in, they canceled the visit. After dinner, the fog had dissipated somewhat so they decided to make the drive up the mountain. It was quite clear when they arrived and then the fog started to roll back in. I managed to capture this silhouette as they viewed the statute one last time just before departure."

When the lightning began, the Secret Service told the President that it was too dangerous to proceed. He took the stage by himself and informed the audience that his speech was canceled and that for everyone's safety, they should return to their busses. Later, he boarded a few of the busses to thank them for attending and apologized for not being able to speak."

see more posts by Jason EasleyIn a conference call with reporters Obama campaign manager Jim Messina dropped some devastating numbers on Romney. Messina pointed out that more people are early voting for Obama in 2012 than did in 2008.Messina laid out what early voting is looking like for the president right now. He said Obama is winning early voting in Ohio, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Ohio early vote turnout is higher for Obama in 2008 than in Republican counties. He said that this election is more diverse. Most new registrants are under 30. 2/3 of those who have early voted are women, African-Americans, and Latinos. Democrats are winning everywhere where there are in person early votes.Obama’s campaign manager explained why they think some of these polls are way off in the battleground states, “I do think there is some differences in states, we delve very deep into these states, and we think some people aren’t getting it right about who this electorate is going to be.” We continue to think the math has changed in Florida.” He said there are 250,000 more registered African-American and Latino voters in Florida, and that overall early voting among African-Americans is up 50% over 2008.New voter registration numbers in Ohio heavily favor Obama. Four in five Ohioans (81 percent) who have registered to vote in 2012 are either female, younger than 30, or African-American or Latino. 64 percent of Ohioans who have registered to vote in 2012, and the same percentage among those who have already voted, live in counties that President Obama won in 2008.The polling numbers for early voting in Ohio also back up what the Obama campaign is saying. A Survey USA poll found that Obama leads by 19 points (57/38) among those who have already. PPP found that Obama leads by 52 points (76%-24%) in Ohio early voting. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Obama leading Romney, 63%-37% with early voters. Even Republican pollster Rasmussen has Obama leading big in Ohio early voting, 63%-34%.Recent early voting numbers in Ohio back up the Obama campaign’s claimthat early voting is up for Obama and down for Romney. 582,402 ballots have been requested this year from precincts that Obama won in 2008, 33,414 more than in from precincts that McCain won.The total number of votes already cast this year (both by mail and in-person) from precincts Obama won in 2008 is 261,304 – 55,636 more than from precincts McCain won.When people worry about the voting machines in Ohio, one of the things that must be considered is that the election has to be close enough to be stolen. During the conference call, both Axelrod and Messina suggested that their goal was to pile up huge margins in the early voting swing states that would make the math for Romney difficult to impossible to overcome on Election Day.I am a believer in the importance of vigilance against election fraud. I think letting the people who would cheat know that we are watching them does serve as a deterrent, but what must be kept in mind is that election must be close enough to be stolen.Only a fool would believe that Romney wouldn’t cheat if given the chance, but the purpose of the Obama ground game is to pile up a big lead in early voting, so that the Republican Party doesn’t get their chance to pull any Election Day shenanigans in Ohio.

During his keynote speech at an election law symposium at University of Toledo on Friday, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) claimed two recent court decisions restoring early voting on the last three days before the election was “un-American.”Husted has sought to restrict early voting, even openly defying a court order to lift the ban on voting on the last three days before Election Day. Once the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal, Husted immediately capped voting hours at just 16 hours for the entire three day period, down from 24 hours in 2008.At the UT symposium, Husted continued his revolt against the federal courts that restored early voting. The Toledo Blade reports:Mr. Husted spoke of a recent federal court decision that he claimed intruded on Ohio’s ability to run its own elections and called it an “un-American approach to voting” — an opinion not shared by many who attended the symposium. “It’s the job of the federal courts to enforce the Constitution; that includes the right to vote,” said Daniel Tokaji, a professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law who was a panelist at the symposium, after the secretary’s comments. “…We should be doing everything we can to improve access to eligible voters.”Husted asserted that every vote would be counted fairly and accurately, saying that voting in Ohio is “easy” and “anybody who says that there are residents in Ohio being barred from the right to vote is irresponsible.” Husted has certainly had to contend with many such “irresponsible” people. Though the court restored this three day period of voting, Husted has still prevented Ohioans from voting on evenings or weekends throughout October. He also recently limited the ways election boards can contact voters to clear up errors in their absentee ballots.

The lawsuit claims that as many as 1,500 pastors engaged in “Pulpit Freedom Sunday” on Sunday, Oct. 7, when pastors endorsed one or more candidates, which is a violation of IRS rules for non-profit organizations.IRS rules state that organizations classified as 501 (c) (3) non-profits — a tax-exempt status most churches and other religious institutions claim — cannot participate or intervene in “any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any political candidate.”Though the regulation has been in place since 1954, a federal court ruled in 2009 that the IRS no longer had the appropriate staff to investigate places of worship after a reorganization changed who in the agency had the authority to launch investigations.IRS rules do allow for some nonpartisan activity by religious institutions, including organizing members to vote and speaking out on issues. But endorsing or supporting specific candidates could jeopardize their tax-exempt status.But a recent Associated Press story reported that the IRS has not challenged any religious organizations on charges of electioneering in the past three years. An IRS spokesperson told the AP that it was “holding any potential church audits in abeyance” until rules on electioneering could be “finalized.”The lawsuit also challenges the legality of several full-page newspaper advertisements paid for by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, another 501 (c) (3), that exhorted voters to vote along “biblical principles.” The ads ran after Graham met with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and promised to do “all I can” to support his campaign.FFRF has filed 27 complaints about church electioneering with the IRS this year, including:— Roman Catholic Bishop David Ricken of Green Bay, Wis., who wrote an appeal on diocesan letterhead inserted in parish bulletins warning voters that they could “put their own soul in jeopardy” if they voted for a party or candidate that supports same-sex marriage or abortion rights.— Roman Catholic Bishop Daniel Jenky of Peoria, Ill., who criticized President Obama in a homily and then exhorted parishioners that “every practicing Catholic must vote, and must vote their Catholic consciences.”— Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Morlino, who, in an article appearing in the local diocesan newspaper, wrote of “non-negotiable” political issues, and that “No Catholic may, in good conscience, vote for’pro-choice’ candidates (or) ... for candidates who promote’same-sex marriage.’”A similar complaint against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishopsfor the electioneering of its members was filed by the Washington-based Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.Copyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.

Even though House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has acknowledged that Obamacare is the “law of the land,” nine state lawmakers in Wisconsin are hoping to ensure that President Obama’s health reform law won’t ever be implemented in their state. The group of Tea Party-affiliated Republicans is backing a bill that would arrest any federal officials who attempt to implement Obamacare in Wisconsin.The state officials responded to a survey from the right-wing advocacy group Campaign for Liberty to confirm they would support “legislation to nullify ObamaCare and authorize state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement the unconstitutional health care scheme known as ObamaCare.” As the Journal Sentinel reports, the nine lawmakers who say they would back such a bill remain unconvinced of the health law’s constitutionality:Rep. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) is one of the nine from Wisconsin who told the Campaign for Liberty he would back legislation to declare Obamacare illegal and allow police to arrest federal officials who take steps to implement it in Wisconsin. He said he believes the health care law is unconstitutional, despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that it passes constitutional muster. “Just because Obama was re-elected does not mean he’s above the constitution,” Kapenga said.Another one of the state lawmakers who responded to Campaign for Liberty’s survey, Rep. Don Pridemore (R-Hartford), said he would also support legislation preventing his governor from setting up a health exchange in the state without first getting approval from the state legislature — similar to a ballot initiative that passed last week in Missouri. “That seems reasonable,” Pridemore told the Journal Sentinel. “It was making a statement to the federal government that we don’t want Obamacare.”Under the health reform law, states that refuse to set up their own health insurance exchanges simply cede their control to the federal government, which will step in and set up an exchange for them.The Campaign for Liberty promotes a “tenther” vision of the Constitution that would allow conservative states to reject federal laws they disagree with, though Wisconsin is still required to follow federal laws like Obamacare.

Mitt Romney thinks you’re dumb. Maybe he’s sure of it.He knows he doesn’t need to release his tax returns, as his father and every major presidential candidate have done for generations. He knows he didn’t need to release the names of the bundlers who have raised millions for his campaign as every candidate has done since the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform went into law. He’s sure he can propose trillions in new tax cuts, claim they’ll pay for themselves and never explain how.So why wouldn’t Mitt Romney believe the American people are dumb?From his business career to his life in politics, his life has been an endless process of running as a progressive savior and governing like a Fox News commentator.Gene Lyons said it best,“Mitt’s less a flip-flopper than a particularly shameless opportunist.”And Mitt has suffered zero consequences for shamelessly shifting on everything. He doesn’t just lie about what he will do and what he believes; he lies about what he’s done.He rants against debt and government spending when his entire business career was built on leveraging debt, and he “saved” the Salt Lake City Olympics with government spending. He would be better for gay rights than Ted Kennedy and as governor waged a one-man war on gay couples being able to adopt. He passed a health care plan that he said would be a model for the nation and then ran against his health care plan being adopted by the nation.In his lifelong quest to become president, Mitt Romney has been for and against nearly everything, including grits. His goal has been to make it perfectly impossible to attack him for what he believes because you can’t figure out what he believes. Sure he said spending federal money on disaster relief was immoral, but that was before disaster relief was popular.Being for everything is kind of a politician’s dream. But even in a trade that depends on pleasing a majority of the people all of the time, no one would dare dream to dash from stance to stance as Romney has.Thankfully, there’s one stance Mitt Romney has taken that he hasn’t been able to erase or cloud with lies—and when he tried, he only made it worse.In November of 2008, Romney said “Let Detroit go bankrupt.” And he meant it.To be clear, the auto industry would have crumbled without an immediate injection of cash. The CEO of General Motors says they needed cash ASAP to survive and none—zero—was available in the private sector, even from Bain Capital. Yes, Romney was proposing government help—but only after bankruptcy.Why did Mitt Romney want Detroit to go straight into bankruptcy? He wasn’t trying to destroy the auto industry, though he was risking just that. He was trying to destroy the auto workers’ union.

Thursday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show,” host Rachel Maddow questioned the wisdom of former Pres. George W. Bush’s decision to speak to a Cayman Islands offshore investment group in the days just before the presidential election.Former President Bill Clinton spent Thursday campaigning for President Barack Obama in Cleveland, Perrysburg, Akron and Chillicothe, Ohio. The Cleveland Plain Dealer‘s headline read, “Bill Clinton rocks the house in Akron as Obama’s proxy.”Another former president, however, President George W. Bush, was not on the campaign trail stumping for Republican nominee former Gov. Mitt Romney (R-MA), but rather in the Cayman Islands, speaking to the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit on Grand Cayman Island.The event promises to “bring together the world’s leading institutional investors, fund managers, academics, economists and regulators in the Cayman Islands – the world’s leading domicile for investment funds – to discuss and debate the fundamentals of a vibrant future for the alternative investments industry.”“I didn’t think that he would do it, but he did,” Maddow said. “On the day when the last Democratic president, President Clinton, did four campaign events for Barack Obama, on that same day, five days before the election, the last Republican president is in the Cayman Islands presumably getting paid a ton of money to keynote a conference on how to offshore your investments in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes.”“Know anybody who’s done that?” she asked.Given how badly things turned out under the last Republican president, Maddow said, it’s hardly surprising that the Romney campaign would want Bush as far away as possible.“But,” she said, “the Caymans? Really? It would have been more subtle if they’d sent him to visit Romney’s old bank accounts in Switzerland.”Watch the clip, embedded via MSNBC, below:Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy

The impreMedia-Latino Decisions tracking poll latest results reveal a high level of interest and engagement by Latino voters in the upcoming congressional and presidential elections. [ Full wave 9 results here ]More than three-fourths of all respondents said they have talked with friends or family members about candidates, issues or other election topics in the last few months and 45% have actively tried to persuade friends or family on their election decision. According to the 2008 American National Election study, 45% of all voters said they tried to influence how others voters, suggesting on this measure Latinos are as engaged in 2012 as all voters were in 2008.  When asked if they had tried to help people register or volunteered for any campaign or voter outreach effort 14% of all Latino voters said yes.  In 2008 the ANES found 4% of all voters had worked on a campaign, 13% gave money to a campaign, and 9% attended a political meeting.Those who said they were very enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming elections climbed from 51% last week to 56% this.“This week’s survey indicates that Latino voters are one of the most highly engaged groups in the election,” said Monica Lozano, CEO of impreMedia. “This has implications for both candidates, but is an especially positive force for President Obama who is still highly favored by Latinos.”Among Latinos, those age 45-65 years old reported the highest level of electoral engagement on every dimension.   For example, within this age group 89% are certain to vote, and 68% say they are very enthusiastic. 59% say they have tried to persuade people on political issues, and 28% have volunteered for a campaign or worked on voter registration.After a slight decline in last week’s poll, Obama’s support is back up near his previous high 3 weeks ago. When asked who they would vote for if the election were held today, a combined 71% of respondents were certain or likely to vote for Obama, compared to 67% last week and 72% two weeks ago. A combined 20% were certain or likely to vote for Romney, compared to 23% last week and 20% two weeks ago.One of the most interesting electoral stories over the last two weeks may be that while the overall national polls show Romney making noticeable gains on Obama, among the Latino electorate Romney gained only 3 points during his rise, but lost those 3 points back this week and stands at 20%.  And a very important footnote to the national polls – if they are not accurately polling and counting Latino voters which will comprise 10% of all voters, they may be overstating Romney’s numbers by 2 or 3 points.“Obama may have lost some ground nationally,” said Monica Lozano, of impreMedia. “But our 9 weeks of polling indicate he has retained consistent support from Latino voters, and they are likely to be a decisive factor in his re-election effort.”Methodology. This is the ninth release of an 11-week tracking poll of Latino registered voters. Each week impreMedia and Latino Decisions release a new rolling cross- section of 300 completed interviews with Latino registered voters across all 50 states. Interviews are conducted in English or Spanish, at the preference of the respondent, all conducted by bilingual interviewers at Latino Decisions calling center, Pacific Market Research. The survey averaged 10 minutes in length, and has an overall margin of error of 5.6% on results that approach a 50/50 distribution. All respondents confirm that they are Hispanic or Latino and currently registered to vote. The ninth week of the survey was fielded Oct 12-Oct 18, 2012. Download week 9 results

Political polling guru Nate Silver is so confident in his statistical models that he just offered to bet MSNBC's Joe Scarborough $1,000 that Barack Obama will win re-election. Scarborough, you may recall, criticized Silver's math earlier this week, saying that "Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue ... they're jokes." He was specifically talking about Silver's FiveThirtyEight website, which shows Mitt Romney with just a 1-in-4 chance of becoming president.Silver has spent the week firing back, criticizing political pundits for not understanding how odds and probability work and aggressively defending his method against critics. As the week has progressed, his model has only shown Obama's chances of winning increasing, which has not coincidentally increased Silver's confidence in the outcome. (As of this morning, Five Thirty Eight gives Obama a 79 percent chance of winning, with a final Electoral College total over 300.)The back-and-forth swipes all came to head today with this tweet, with Silver offering a friendly $1,000 wager on Tuesday's result, with the winnings going to charity.After that Politico story claiming Silver was putting his reputation on the line with this election, he's making it clear that he's willing to put more on the line than that. And he's also clearly fed up with pundits who aren't willing to put anything on the line to back up their numerous predictions. Scarborough was not on the set of his MSNBC show this morning and has yet to respond, but he already has one wager riding on Tuesday's vote. Just yesterday, he agreed to a bet with Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod over their facial hair. (Axelrod will shave his mustache if Obama loses Michigan, Minnesota, or Pennsylvania. Scarborough will grow one if Romney loses Florida or North Carolina.) Will Joe put his money where his mouth—and mustache—is?UPDATE: Scarborough has responded by suggesting they both donate $1,000 to the Red Cross right now. Silver's response? Let's raise the stakes!Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments or send an email to the author at dashiell at dashiellbennett dot com.

This week we were reminded that Republicans are masters of blaming everything—but their own beliefs.Why did Mitt Romney lose? It couldn’t be because the GOP is wrong on taxes, health care, women’s rights, immigration, education, marriage, regulation, diplomacy, climate change, evolution, science, polling, jobs numbers, fashion, sex, Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, Meat Loaf…No, it had to be Hurricane Sandy, ORCA, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, mean ole Barack Obama actually daring to release negative ads, one New Black Panther, a mural in one polling place…The truth is two Republicans and two Democrats—besides President Obama and his indomitable team, who came up with the ninja idea of taking Mitt Romney’s health care plan—deserve credit for defeating Mitt.But before I reveal who the heroes and goats are, let me clearly state that none of this would have been possible if the GOP wasn’t just flat-out-100-percent-Dick Morris-wrong about everything.Now I can tell you that the two Democrats most responsible for Romney’s defeat are Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton.In 2008, Kennedy gave Paul Begala a roadmap for defeating Mitt Romney. Kennedy said, “Don’t underestimate Romney. He’s smart and resourceful and will say anything, take any position.”Kennedy explained how his staff tracked down ex-Bain employees and let their stories of Romney’s disregard for labor undo his ambitions. Begala had Kennedy’s advice ready when he went to work with the Priorities USA Super PAC:Bill Clinton, of course, is the second Democrat who most helped defeat Romney in two distinct ways.According to reports, the former president advised the Obama campaign not to focus on Mitt Romney’s tendency to flop on any issue as if he’s a goldfish in a two-year-old’s hand — that might actually appeal to moderate voters. Clinton was proven right at the first debate when Romney’s knack for reinvention shook the course of the whole race. Instead, Clinton supported exposing Romney’s Bain record and painting Romney as “Bush on steroids.”What was even more important was Bill Clinton’s role as the Secretary of Explaining Sh*t.As a witness for the defense, he was incomparable. With his 65 percent approval rating, he testified to President Obama’s successes and the virtue of his plan going forward. He also inoculated the president against criticism by repeatedly reminding voters that the same people attacking the president said terrible things about him—though they were now praising him as if he’d suddenly become Diet Reagan.

Most Americans doubt President Obama and congressional Republicans will avoid hurtling over the fiscal cliff before January 1, 2013, according to a new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll. By 51 to 38 percent, more predict Obama and Republicans will not reach an agreement in time, and the survey finds widespread anxiety over the consequences of such a failure.More than six in 10 believe a missed deadline would have an overall negative impact on the U.S. economy, and about the same number anticipate a blow to their personal finances, including 74 percent of those with incomes of at least $100,000. Without a deal, taxes will jump for nine in 10 Americans, with the steepest hikes for top income brackets.(See interactive poll results with breakdowns by group here)The public is sharpening its focus on the issue, but Republicans are paying more attention than others and are more worried about the fallout of failed negotiations. Nearly half of Republicans are following the issue “very closely,” and more than seven in 10 Republicans anticipate negative consequences for their finances and the overall economy.Only about half of Democrats see a mostly negative outcome for either the economy or their finances, and 31 percent say passing the cliff will actually help the economy. Economists predict inaction will throw the economy into recession.But Republicans in Congress may face more public pressure to make concessions. Should negotiations break down to avoid the $500 billion rash of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts, 53 percent are inclined to blame Republicans in Congress while 29 percent single out Obama. If New Year’s Day 2013 comes without a deal, a panoply of fiscal band-aids — from the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts to broad spending cuts — would take effect.Even with all the moving parts, nearly six in ten Americans says they understand the impact of impending tax increases and spending cuts at least “fairly well.” Still, only about a quarter are “very well” informed and four in 10 report little or no understanding of the consequences.The poll was conducted Nov. 8 to 11 among a random national sample of 1,000 adults using conventional and cellular phones. The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Click here for full question wording, results, and interactive breakdowns by group.

Look at this map, and notice that deep, deep in the Republican South, there's a thin blue band stretching from the Carolinas through Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. These are the counties that went for Obama in the last election. A blue crescent in a sea of red.These same counties went mostly blue in 2004 and 2000. Why? Well, the best answer, says marine biologist Craig McClain, may be an old one, going back before the Civil War, before 1776, before Columbus, back more than 100 million years to the days when the Deep South was under water. Those counties, as he writes here, went for Obama because trillions and trillions and trillions of teeny sun-loving creatures died there. He's talking about plankton. That's why the Republicans can't carry those counties. Blame plankton.[Don't leave. I know some of you bounced here because my headline was political, and the word "plankton" will send you scuttling back to HuffPo, Politico and Drudge, where politics is plankton-free. But before you go, check out this next map.]It's an image of North America as it looked during the Cretaceous era, 129 million to 65 million years ago. As you can see, much of the continent was still covered by water. The Deep South had a shoreline that curled through the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, and there, in the shallow waters just offshore, were immense populations of floating, single-celled creatures who drifted about, trapped sunshine, captured carbon, then died and sank to the sea bottom. Those creatures became long stretches of nutritious chalk. (I love chalk.)When sea levels dropped and North America took on its modern shape, those ancient beaches — so alkaline, porous and rich with organic material — became a "black belt" of rich soil, running right through the South. You can see the Cretaceous beaches in this map, colored green. McClain got these maps from geologist Steve Dutch's website, at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay.And because this stretch was so rich and fertile, when cotton farmers moved here in the 19th century, this stretch produced the most cotton per acre. Harvests of 4,000-plus bales were common here. Notice that the most productive plantations mirror the ancient coastline.McClain, quoting from Booker T. Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery, points out: "The part of the country possessing this thick, dark and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers." After the Civil War, a lot of former slaves stayed on this land, and while many migrated North, their families are still there.In this 2000 census, you can see that the counties with the biggest populations of African-Americans still trace that Cretaceous shoreline.This, says marine biologist McClain, explains that odd stretch of Obama blue; it's African-Americans sitting on old soil from ancient organisms that turned sunshine into fertilizer. So plankton remain a force in Southern elections — though not always, not continuously. After the Civil War, when the South voted solidly Democratic and Jim Crow laws ruled, many blacks couldn't vote, so the pattern disappears. Voting rights laws hadn't been passed during the Goldwater-Johnson election of 1964, so in this map, the African-American difference is invisible.But some African-Americans were still there. So was the soil (though it's not as rich as it once was), and so were the rocks that geologist Steve Dutch "found immediately familiar" because they mapped those ancient shores. All of which is to say, when you cover politics, sometimes, without realizing it, you are also telling rock tales. Geology, every so often, peeks through.Geologist Steve Dutch's detailed maps, and careful analysis, come from a study he did of the Bush-Gore election in 2000. He called it "Geology and Election 2000." You can find thathere. "Dr. M" (that's Craig McClain's Nom de Blog at "Deep Sea News") wrote his geology analysishere.

A slew of new reporting this morning debunks Fox News reports claiming that the Obama administration withheld assistance during the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya. With these revelations, the combined conservative narrative as led by Fox News — that the Obama administration failed to respond adequately during the attack and that mainstream media has not covered Benghazi enough — is in further disarray.The Los Angeles Times’ version of the CIA’s role focuses the most heavily on pushing back on Fox’s spin:“At every level in the chain of command, from the senior officers in Libya to the most senior officials in Washington, everyone was fully engaged in trying to provide whatever help they could,” a senior intelligence official said in a statement. “There were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support.”Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin claimed in an “exclusive” report last week that the CIA denied Tyrone Woods, one of the four Americans killed in the attack, permission to help repel the assault. Griffin’s reporting spun off into a bevy of conspiracy theories on the far right. The Pentagon, White House, and CIA had all previously denied refusing requests for support. The New York Times reports on the Pentagon’s involvement:[A] senior official also sought to rebut reports that C.I.A. requests for support from the Pentagon that night had gone unheeded. In fact, the official said, the military diverted a Predator drone from a reconnaissance mission in Darnah, 90 miles away, in time to oversee the mission’s evacuation. The two commandos, based at the embassy in Tripoli, joined the reinforcements. And a military transport plane flew the wounded Americans and Mr. Stevens’s body out of Libya.The new reports also contain previously unreported details about the CIA’s role in Benghazi. President Obama and Secretary of Defense Panetta did order U.S. forces into the region, but the CIA was the first to respond to the attack, arriving on the scene in under half an hour.The lack of security at the outpost in Benghazi, far removed from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, has been the subject of inquiry by both Fox News and Congressional Republicans. The Wall Street Journal sheds new light onto why that was the case. The CIA and State Department had entered into a series of secret deals in which the Agency would provide emergency security to the diplomats operating within Libya.While the State Department primarily relied upon local Libyan militias for day-to-day protection, as well as contracted British private security, the arrangement between it and the CIA explains why the outpost seemed under-protected. The revelation also will prompt a renewed look at the State Department’s decisions to remove Department of Defense-provided security from the Embassy in Tripoli, which were highly scrutinized during Rep. Darrel Issa’s hearings.The primary role of the CIA was intelligence gathering and covert operations within Benghazi. Agents there operated out of an annex originally reported to be an offshoot of the diplomatic mission, revealed officially — and accidentally — during Issa’s highly politicized hearing into the Benghazi attacks. The Agency’s large presence may also help explain why the diplomatic compound was open to journalists and looters for weeks after the attack, as more vital intelligence documents were collected.Washington Post’s David Ignatius has gone as far as to produce a detailed minute-by-minute timeline, of the events that night. These reports together give the clearest picture yet of the events in Benghazi. Rather than the Obama Presidency unraveling as the news organization has claimed, it appears to be Fox News’ narrative that is coming undone instead.

In case you hadn’t already heard, thousands of Walmart employees are expected to walk off the job before next week’s shopping extravaganza known as Black Friday. The workers are striking to protest suppressed wages, spiking health care premiums, and management retaliation against employee organizing.This week, an Orlando Walmart store pushed union-busting beyond the limits of the law to intimidate workers from participating in the national strike. The incident involves Alex Rivera, a Walmart employee who was fired in September, two months after he joined an employee rights group called Organized United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart).Rivera visited the store where he used to work on Wednesday to talk with some former colleagues about the Black Friday strike. While Rivera paused to sip water from a fountain, police rushed up behind him without warning, grabbed his arms, and wrested him into handcuffs, Josh Eidelson reports for The Nation. The false arrest was a direct result of Walmart management falsely reporting to police that Rivera had signed a trespassing warning preventing him from returning to the premises.As the truth came to light, the outcome was a high-profile embarrassment for the leading U.S. retailer. Once police discovered that no such trespassing warning existed, they grimaced at being mislead by Walmart reps and released Rivera from custody. Rivera recounted his public humiliation and concerns about Walmart employee suppression to The Nation:Last Wednesday wasn’t the first time Rivera has been harassed by his local Walmart store. After Rivera joined the OUR Walmart group on July 20, he said Walmart management began following his every move, increased his workload, prevented him from talking to co-workers during work, and held mandatory employee meetings to bash the OUR Walmart group.On Sept. 22, Rivera was terminated for correcting his timesheet, something he said was in accordance with company policy and completed “without incident” for three years before becoming an activist.Returning to what may be the largest Walmart strike in history, a thousand store protests are planned over the upcoming week, culminating on Black Friday, says the employee rights group Making Change at Walmart. Strikes and protests are planned in Chicago; Dallas; Los Angeles; Miami; Milwaukee; Washington, D.C.; Oklahoma; Mississippi; Louisiana and Minnesota.Since their usual union-busting tactics haven’t been enough to squash the uprising, Walmart has petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to halt what it claims are unlawful efforts to disrupt its business.Through the decades Walmart has been in operation, the retail giant has run an aggressive anti-union campaign. Some tactics are considered legal, while some are clearly illegal, says a 2007 report titled “Discounting Rights: Wal-Mart’s Violation of U.S. Workers’ Right to Freedom of Association.”Walmart’s anti-employee-organizing crackdown has included showing an anti-union video during new employee training; instituting a 24-hour hotline for managers to report any signs of union organizing activity; surveilling, discipling and firing employees suspected of union activities; and presenting lectures on the “evils of unionism” at stores with organizing activity.Can The Waltons Afford To Pay Employees More?At the same time Walmart workers are fighting for economic rights and dignity, the Walton family is the richest family in the country. Together, the Walmart heirs possess more wealth than the bottom 41.5% of American families combined, a stat verified by Politifact.The bottom-line: Wal-Mart won’t change its anti-worker ways until shoppers demand that it do so.Please stand with the 99% this holiday season. Don’t shop at Walmart if you can avoid it – and DON’T CROSS PICKET LINES WHILE WALMART WORKERS ARE STRIKING ON THANKSGIVING AND BLACK FRIDAY.Want stay in the loop? @LiberaLLamp on Twitter – On FacebookView Liberal Lamp’s archive on this site or Contact the author of this post

Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Jr., an unsuccessful candidate for this year’s GOP presidential nomination, is being mentioned as a possible pick to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she steps down at the start of Obama’s second term.SALT LAKE CITY — With Mitt Romney losing his race for the White House, another Republican with Utah ties may be on his way to Washington, D.C. to play a key role in President Barack Obama’s administration.Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Jr., an unsuccessful candidate for this year’s GOP presidential nomination, is being mentioned as a possible pick to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she steps down at the start of Obama’s second term.The Associated Press reported Thursday that while U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry are likely high on Obama’s list, unnamed officials “are pointing to Jon Huntsman,” who served as the Democratic president’s U.S. ambassador to China.The wire service said Huntsman continues to be widely respected in the administration, despite his attempt to unseat Obama. Naming Huntsman to another top post would allow the president to claim bipartisanship while tapping his extensive knowledge of China.Huntsman told KSL-TV that his future is focused on his family and his work, which includes serving as distinguished fellow at a prominent Washington think tank and as chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Institute as well as giving speeches around the country.He described what’s ahead for him as “managing a lot of projects that I find absolutely fun, interesting and satisfying.” After returning from China, Huntsman bought a family home in Washington and also a condominium in downtown Salt Lake City.The speculation Huntsman could be asked a second time to serve in the Obama administration caught many political observers off guard.“Oh, wow. Wow. Really?” said Quin Monson, head of Brigham Young University’s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. “That would be very surprising.”Monson said it would seem unlikely Huntsman would be brought back into a Democratic administration after running against President Obama.“On the other hand, he’s signaling he’s had it with the Republican Party. Going back for another round seems to make his transition complete,” Monson said, referring to Huntsman’s complaints about the direction the GOP is headed.If Huntsman is serious about pursuing the post, Monson said that’s likely a sign he’s no longer eyeing another presidential bid, in 2016, at least not as a Republican. Huntsman has talked about the need for a new, third political party to emerge.

President Obama wins Florida with 49.9 percent of the popular vote, taking the state’s 29 electoral votes. The race was close, with only a 47,028 vote difference according to The Washington Post.[Editor's Update: Click here to read why IVN called Florida for Obama]Florida was the last state to be called, due in part to long lines at some polling locations and absentee ballots that needed to be counted in such a close race. According to Huffington Post, Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections Penelope Townsley said the delay was due to “an extremely high volume of absentee ballots.” In some precincts voters were still casting ballots past midnight.It’s possible that a large group of independent voters swung the state in Obama’s favor. The percentage of Republicans was equal to that of Democrats, putting the decision largely in the hands of independents. Obama also got a boost from the minority vote. According to CNN exit polls, an impressive 95 percent of African Americans chose Obama, along with 60 percent of Hispanics. Women, making up 55 percent of the voter population in Florida, also favored Obama.The Interstate 4 Corridor had been a closely watched area for the election. Historically the candidate who takes the zone, which includes Tampa, takes the state. The I-4 Corridor generally divides the state with Republicans to the north and Democrats to the south. According to News Press, 3.6 million voters live in the cluster of counties, and nearly a million of them are registered as independents.Political contributors on CNN’s election coverage discussed the possible negative effect Romney’s “self-deportation” comment made earlier in January had on Florida voters. While Romney revoked his former stance, the statement resonated with the large Hispanic population. According to Naples News, in the past six years, the number of registered Hispanic Democrats in Osceola County alone has grown by about 10,000, and Republicans have registered only 100.Although Ohio gave Obama the election, Florida was a nail bitter for both campaigns. Obama outspent Romney in Florida by $22 million, but according to data compiled from The Washington Post by Dan Lipka, President Obama visited the state a total of 26 times while Romney made 38 stops. Florida made it to the top ten list of most visited states for both candidates. Both campaigns were smart to put their resources into Florida. Although it was an extremely close race, President Obama was re-elected without needing the state.

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) says a “scheduling error” is to blame after he missed a Senate hearing on the attacks in Benghazi on Tuesday and instead held a press conference where he called for an investigation into those same attacks.CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash reported on Thursday that Ted Barrett, the network’s Senate producer, had an “intense very angry exchange” with McCain when he asked about why the senator had missed the hearing.“I have to tell you something that just happened on Capitol Hill, and that is our senate producer Ted Barrett just ran into John McCain and asked about something that we’re hearing from Democrats, which is John McCain is calling for more information to Congress, but he had a press conference yesterday instead of going to a closed briefing where administration officials were giving more information,” Bash told CNN anchor Carol Costello. “Well, Ted Barrett asked John McCain about that, and it was apparently an intense very angry exchange and McCain simply would not comment on it at all.”McCain spokesperson Brian Rogers later told Slate’s Dave Weigel that “Senator McCain was absent from the hearing due to a scheduling error.”In addition to his press conference, the Arizona senator has appeared on Fox News, CBS and NBC in the last 24 hours to call for a Watergate-style committee to investigate the attacks in Benghazi. He has also pledged to block U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice from becoming the next secretary of state because he said that her early assessment of the attacks made her “not qualified” for the job.During a press conference on Wednesday, President Barack Obama lashed out at McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for for their “outrageous” attacks on Rice.“If Sen. McCain and Sen. Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me,” the president remarked. “And I’m happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. ambassador who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous.”Obama added that he would not argue that Congress had a duty to get to the bottom of the attacks, “but when they go after the U.N. ambassador apparently because they think she’s an easy target then they’ve got a problem with me.”Watch this video from CNN’s Newsroom via Think Progress, broadcast Nov. 15, 2012.

We don’t want another Iraq, we don’t want another Afghanistan. That’s not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the -- the world reject these -- these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this:One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies.But what’s been happening over the last couple of years is, as we’ve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And -- and they’re throughout many nations in the Middle East.ROMNEY: It’s wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.But next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libya’s 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want -- we want to make sure that we’re seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we’ve got real (inaudible).SCHIEFFER: We’ll get to that, but let’s give the president a chance.OBAMA: Governor Romney, I’m glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.You say that you’re not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven’t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you’ve offered an opinion, you’ve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.

Two auto companies made a surprise foray into the presidential campaign on Tuesday, bluntly calling out Mitt Romney for his deceptive Ohio ads that suggest they plan to ship local jobs to China. But according to the Romney campaign, there’s nothing to see here.“Their comments don’t refute anything in our ad,” spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Detroit News on Wednesday.That’s true only in the narrowest, most carefully lawyered sense. After Romney outright misstated last week that Jeep was considering shipping Ohio jobs to China, a claim the company immediately denied (they’re actually adding jobs at their Ohio plant), their ads were more careful to say only that Jeep was looking at expanding in China. This is accurate, but the company says it’s completely unrelated to their domestic workforce and only part of operations catering to the Asian market. And the innuendo behind their TV ads and especially their radio ads is as unmistakably clear as it is misleading: the auto bailout didn’t really save Ohio jobs, it’s sending them to China. From Romney’s unannounced radio spot:It was this implied claim that prompted the CEO of Chrysler, Sergio Marchionne, to personally condemn the “inaccurate” ads coming from Romney.“Jeep is one of our truly global brands with uniquely American roots,” he said. “This will never change. So much so that we committed that the iconic Wrangler nameplate, currently produced in our Toledo, Ohio plant, will never see full production outside the United States.”For GM, the objectionable content was the suggestion that net losses under Obama — virtually all of them stemming from its near-collapse in 2009 — were proof the bailout failed. But the alternative to the bailout wasn’t that GM would make layoffs, it was that it would disappear entirely. Instead, GM moved back to profitability and added U.S. jobs. This 2009 doomsday scenario is what prompted the Center for Automotive Research to conclude that the bailout saved over 1 million jobs in a study of its effects.GM’s spokesman Greg Martin assailed the ads on Tuesday, telling the Detroit Free Press that their facts come from a “parallel universe.”“No amount of campaign politics at its cynical worst will diminish our record of creating jobs in the U.S. and repatriating profits back to this country,” Martin said.

see more posts by Jason EasleyRepublicans have quickly shifted from licking their election defeat wounds to trying to tie the David Petraeus’ affair to Benghazi in order to impeach President Obama.The conspiracy theories surrounding the Petraeus resignation are running wild on the right. A FoxNews.comstory is typical of the right’s obsession with the time of the CIA director’s resignation, “Washington is still reeling from the resignation of General David Petraeus as head of the CIA just days before he was supposed to testify on Capitol Hill about what the CIA knew about the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi on September 11, and when it knew it. The many questions surrounding that scandal-including why the FBI was reading the CIA director’s emails and Petraeus’s mistress’s bizarre claims about a secret prison in the Benghazi CIA annex — just add to the picture of an Obama administration out of control on national security—and the conclusion that someone knowingly put an American ambassador at risk to his life; left him there to die; and then lied about it afterwards.”On the television side Fox News contributor John Bolton claimed that Eric Holder knew about the affair months ago, and took the conspiracy to the next level by asking, “Did the attorney general sit on this information for two months?”Fox News contributor Dana Perino sat down with Fox and Friends and floated the conspiracy that Obama forced Petraeus because he was about to testify on Benghazi, “I don’t think anybody throws away their 37-year marriage on national television to cover up for a White House on an issue like Benghazi. That doesn’t make sense to me. However, is it plausible that they said, ‘do this or we will expose you’? And he said, ‘I’ll expose myself.”It is obvious where they are going with this.The Petraeus resignation is part of an Obama cover up that if exposed will bring down his presidency.Having learned nothing from when they tried to do this to Bill Clinton during his second term, Republicans are actively looking for a way to impeach President Obama.You’ll notice that two of the three people quoted above served in the Bush administration. (WMD and Valarie Plame, anyone?) The other thing that each of these conspiracies have in common is that they are being floated by Fox News. After Romney’s crushing defeat last week, Fox News is standing by on the ready with exactly what their audience needs. An insane conspiracy that will allow them to retreat back into their bubble and ignore reality. Just like in 2008 when Glenn Beck and his political alternate universe rose to fame after Obama won, Petraeus and Benghazi are 2012?s right wing retreat from reality.After losing elections, paranoid conspiracy theories are Republican comfort food used to soothe the fractured psyche of those who got a taste of what ‘Real America’ actually thinks of them.If anyone thought the GOP rank and file would learn any lessons from their latest defeat, think again.The GOP rank and file fueled by their media and with several radical House Republicans at the ready are set to launch another jihad against reality.How are Republicans responding to Obama winning reelection?By trying to make the case for impeaching the President of the United States.

1 of 3.U.S. President Barack Obama listens to former Secretary of State Colin Powell (L) during their meeting in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, December 1, 2010."I think we ought to keep on the track that we are on," the Republican, who also backed Obama in 2008, told "CBS This Morning." He added, "I voted for him in 2008 and I plan to stick with him in 2012."The move comes just days after Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney clashed over foreign policy in the third and last presidential debate ahead of the November 6 election.Polls show Obama and Romney neck and neck. A Reuters/Ipsos online tracking poll gave Romney a 1-point edge on Wednesday, 47 percent to Obama's 46 percent.Obama welcomed the endorsement at a rally in Richmond, Virginia."I was proud and humbled to learn that we have Colin Powell's support in this campaign. I'm grateful to him for his lifetime of service to his country both as a soldier and as a diplomat," he told the crowd.The president earlier called Powell to thank him, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One before landing in Virginia, a battleground state where the military vote is important.In his endorsement, Powell said domestic issues such as the economy, healthcare and education loomed large in his support for a second term for Obama."When he took over, the country was in very, very difficult straits, we were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression ... we were in real trouble," Powell said, adding that housing market has started to pick up, the auto industry has recovered and consumer confidence is rising."I think generally we've come out of the dive and starting to gain altitude," he said. "I see that we are starting to rise up," he said, but added problems such as unemployment and the housing market still need work.Powell also criticized Romney's foreign policy as inconsistent and questioned the former Massachusetts governor's ability to address the deficit and looming defense cuts."I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we'd be getting with respect to foreign policy," he told CBS, calling Romney's foreign policy "a moving target."As for the U.S. budget, he added: "It's essentially, let's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things, but that compensation does not cover all the cuts intended or the expenses associated with defense."Powell, a moderate Republican, served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush. Some of Romney's advisers are more conservative veterans of the Bush administration."There's some very, very strong neo-conservative views that are presented by the governor that I have some trouble with," Powell said.A retired four-star general, Powell was also chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under former President George H.W. Bush and was national security advisor under former President Ronald Reagan.Republican Senator John McCain, a harsh critic of the Obama administration's handling of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, blasted Powell's endorsement."General Powell, you disappoint us, and you have harmed your legacy even further by defending what has clearly been the most feckless foreign policy in my lifetime," McCain, the Republican presidential candidate who lost to Obama in 2008, told FOX News Radio's "Kilmeade & Friends" program.(Reporting by Susan Heavey; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Vicki Allen)

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is taking the Internal Revenue Service to court over its failure to enforce electioneering restrictions against churches and religious organizations, calling it a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and of FFRF’s equal protection rights. FFRF filed the lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. (View the lawsuit here.) A widely circulated Bloomberg news article quoted Russell Renwicks, with the IRS’ Tax-Exempt and Government Entities division, saying the IRS has suspended tax audits of churches. Other sources claim the IRS hasn’t been auditing churches since 2009. (See AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll’s story, “IRS Not Enforcing Rules on Churches and Politics.”) Although an IRS spokesman claimed Renwicks “misspoke,” there appears to be no evidence of IRS inquiries or action in the past three years.As many as 1,500 clergy reportedly violated the electioneering restrictions on Sunday, Oct. 7, 2012, notes FFRF’s legal complaint. The complaint also references “blatantly political” full-page ads running in the three Sundays leading up to the presidential elections by the Billy Graham Evangelical Association.FFRF, a state/church watchdog based in Madison, Wis., is asking the the federal court to enjoin IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman from continuing “a policy of non-enforcement of the electioneering restrictions against churches and religious organizations.”Additionally, FFRF seeks to order Shulman “to authorize a high-ranking official within the IRS to approve and initiate enforcement of the restrictions of §501(c)(3) against churches and religious organizations, including the electioneering restrictions, as required by law.”FFRF has more than 19,000 members nationwide “who are opposed to government preferences and favoritism toward religion.” FFRF is regularly contacted by its members and members of the public over specific and general violations of church electioneering restrictions, and FFRF staff attorneys regularly ask the IRS to investigate such violations.This non-enforcement “constitutes preferential treatment to churches and religious organizations that is not provided to other tax-exempt organizations, including FFRF,” the complaint notes. “Churches and religious organizations obtain a significant benefit as a result of being non-exempt from income taxation, while also being able to preferentially engage in electioneering, which is something secular tax-exempt organizations cannot do.”This preferential tax exemption involves more than $100 billion annually in tax-free contributions to churches and religious organizations in the United States.In addition to reporting the Graham ministry’s electioneering to the IRS, FFRF has sent letters of complaint to the IRS involving 27 other such violations so far this year. Recent complaints include:• Green Bay Bishop David L. Ricken, who wrote an article on diocesan letterhead inserted in all parish bulletins about voting and choosing the president and other offices. Ricken warned that if Catholics vote for a party or candidate who supports abortion rights or marriage equality, “you could be morally ‘complicit’ with these choices which are intrinsically evil. This could put your own soul in jeopardy.” (Read full FFRF letter to IRS.)• Peoria Bishop Daniel R. Jenky, who, in an April homily, sharply criticized President Obama, referencing the 2012 presidential election, saying Obama was “following a similar path” as Hitler and Stalin. Jenky said “every practicing Catholic must vote, and must vote their Catholic consciences. . .” (Read full FFRF letter to IRS.)• Bishop Robert Morlino of Madison, Wis., who wrote a Nov. 1 article, “Official guidelines for forming a Catholic conscience in the Diocese of Madison,” published in the Catholic Herald, spelling out “non-negotiable” political areas. “No Catholic may, in good conscience, vote for ‘pro-choice’ candidates [or] . . . for candidates who promote ‘same-sex marriage.’ ” (Read full FFRF letter to IRS.)The lawsuit, FFRF v. IRS, (12-cv-818), was filed by attorney Richard L. Bolton on behalf of FFRF.Click here to request information about FFRF.

At a time when the federal government is starved for cash -- and facing layoffs and cuts in services across the board -- more and more corporations are sidestepping their traditional tax rate and keeping millions of dollars for themselves.The number of U.S. corporations structuring their businesses in such a way that they can avoid higher taxes has skyrocketed in the past quarter century, The Wall Street Journal reports.In 1986, about 24 percent of corporations were what's known as nontaxable businesses -- meaning the companies themselves pay no federal income taxes -- instead passing on the earnings to individual investors to pay taxes on. By 2008, these businesses accounted for about 69 percent of all corporations, a designation that can save companies hundreds of millions of dollars in a single yearAdvocates for the business community have expressed frustration with the country's 35 percent corporate income tax rate, calling it unreasonably high. In practice, though, it's common for big businesses to pay much less, thanks to a cornucopia of tax-code loopholes and exemptions won by lobbyists.The issue of corporate tax participation has become especially pressing in recent years, as the country struggles to manage its ballooning deficits. Corporate taxes for non-financial companies have fallen more than 13 percent since 2007, according to Bloomberg. At the same time, the national debt grew to $15.23 trillion from $9.13 trillion -- a number larger than the economy itself.According to a recent analysis of nearly 300 Fortune 500 companies by the Citizens for Tax Justice, the average company was paying just 18.3 percent in taxes -- a little more than half the official rate. And by using techniques like industry subsidies, stock option packages, and moving assets overseas where they can't be taxed, 30 companies mentioned in the report -- including Wells Fargo, Verizon, Boeing and General Electric -- didn't pay a cent in federal taxes in 2008, 2009 or 2010, the report found.This is truly brilliant (you gotta see this):

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) put aside his campaigning for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Sunday to praise President Barack Obama for his responsiveness to the Garden State's needs in preparing for Hurricane Sandy.During a briefing with emergency personnel, residents and press, Christie thanked Obama for holding a conference call with him and governors of other states expected to be impacted by the storm, the Star-Ledger reports.“I appreciated the president’s outreach today in making sure that we know he’s watching this and is concerned about the health and welfare and safety of the people of the state of New Jersey,” he said.Christie shortened a campaign trip for Romney in North Carolina and canceled a political trip to Nevada in order to return to New Jersey to focus on the hurricane.Christie also announced Sunday that he is asking Obama to issue a pre-landfall emergency declaration for New Jersey in order to expedite federal assistance for the state. A press release from Christie's office indicated that such a declaration would allow New Jersey to start requesting federal funds and other aid in advance of the storm. Obama issued a similar declaration for New York state.During a press briefing Sunday night, Christie criticized the Democratic leaders of the New Jersey state legislature for failing to approve a request to fine companies a higher fee if they don't respond to power outages in a timely manner. The current fine is $100 a day, but Christie wants to raise the fee to $25,000 a day. He made the request in September following a report from the state Board of Public Utilities regarding power companies' response to Hurricane Irene, which left parts of northern New Jersey without power for days.“The legislature has failed to give me the fining authority I requested," Christie said. "That is a significant disappointment. The fact that they did not come in is a disappointment.”Christie did indicate during his briefing that he and Bob Hanna, president of the Board of Public Utilities, have been in contact with power companies regarding hurricane preparation.The governor also addressed the Nov. 6 election during his briefing, saying that Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno (R), who also serves as New Jersey's secretary of state, has been participating in conference calls with other East Coast secretaries of state regarding the hurricane's potential impact on the election. Christie declined to discuss the specifics of Guadagno's conversations, but said that any final decision would occur after the hurricane has passed.“We will get to our national election when we get to it," Christie said.UPDATE: Oct. 29 -- President Barack Obama issued a federal emergency declaration for New jersey late Sunday evening in advance of Hurricane Sandy making landfall in the Garden State. The emergency declaration allows federal emergency management officials to assist state officials during the storm and provide federal financial assistance to New Jersey.

Within the nation's rough-and-tumble political discourse—whether it be on the floor of the House or Senate, on the campaign trail, or in the newsrooms and editorial offices of mainstream media outlets—there is often a disinclination to use a certain word: "lie." It is a serious charge to render, and conventional pols, pundits, reporters, and media bigshots often shy away from it, resorting to other means of discussing a falsehood from an official or candidate. Common cop-outs include: "that's stretching the truth," "those facts are not correct," and "the experts dispute that." As the author of The Lies of George W. Bush, I certainly know that in many quarters calling a politician or officeholder a liar is considered a step too far, given that such an accusation is a judgment of motive and intent and, thus, an assault on character. (Remember the famous line from Seinfeld: "It's not a lie if you believe it.") In recent years, MSM factcheckers have found creative ways to dub a lie a lie. Politifact.com awards a "pants on fire" rating to egregiously false statements; the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler assigns Pinocchios to untrue assertions. Yet deploying the l-word is unusual.Obama dared to cross that line with a new campaign ad. Entitled "Collapse," the spot targets Mitt Romney's over-the-top and recklessly untrue claim that as a consequence of Obama bailing-out the auto industry, Chrysler is moving Jeep production jobs from the United States to China. Romney, as I've reported, invested heavily in firms that outsourced (or exploited outsourcing) to China when he was leading Bain Capital. (See here and here.) Yet in the closing days of the 2012 campaign, Romney has been trying to turn Obama's strength (he saved Detroit) into a liability by making a phony charge about Jeep jobs. Numerous media accounts have noted that Romney is dead wrong, and Chrysler itself has declared this is a false claim. Romney, as is his practice, has refused to apologize.So in this ad, the Obama campaign notes, "after Romney’s false claim of Jeep outsourcing to China, Chrysler itself has refuted Romney's lie." It's a bit of a glancing blow. The ad, which also highlights Romney's past opposition to Obama's auto industry rescue, does not use the other l-word: "liar." Yet at the end, it nearly says that: "Mitt Romney: wrong then; dishonest now."In 1996, when conservative New York Times columnist William Safire called Hillary Clinton a "congenital liar," he sparked a media firestorm. (President Bill Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said at the time, "the president, if he were not the president, would have delivered a more forceful response to that on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose.") Since then, there have been few high-profile deployments of the l-bomb in Washington circles (except, of course, during the Clinton impeachment). Yet the reluctance to call a lie a lie (or a liar a liar) works to the advantage of politicians who do fib, prevaricate, and out-right lie. It is easier for them to get away with mugging the truth, if others are hesitant to use plain language in response. Obama's lie-charging ad might work because Romney has developed (at least among some voters) a reputation for shiftiness. But if Obama should not triumph next Tuesday, the real question may be whether he waited too long to wage this fundamental attack on his opponent's character.

I've had the misfortune of experiencing first hand republican party politic s in my home state of Massachusetts. Those who were not on the Romney band wagon were removed as delegates, even though we were elected by the people. As a result many of us have become alienated and disenfranchised, and do not know for whom to cast our votes.Had the GOP not treated us, their constituency, so disrespectfully, my attitude toward the presidential elections may be more cool. However, my associations with republicans have caused me to rethink my allegiances and positions. In a twist on the words of Groucho Marx, I don't want to belong to any club that would have Mitt Romney as a member.What are the results of my rethinking my allegiances and positions? They are several. For one, the liberal press (vs the conservative press), is far more interested in accurate and honest reporting. As a result, I have begun to view liberals as more honest and willing to examine unfavorable facts about their candidate than the average conservative. This honesty is reflected in the candidates that they choose to represent them. While Obama isn't the perfect politician, he doesn't dodge facts or shift positions. He tells you his vision of America, even if it is controversial. Obama isn't ashamed of his political philosophy, and he explains his positions with clarity and detail.I believe democrats care far more about the individual than republicans do. Republicans are only out for their selves, and as a result they nominated someone who is only our for his self. Romney doesn't even care about his own party. Democrats, on the other hand, care about each other, and as a result they nominated someone who shows an honest respect for his fellow citizen, regardless of partisanship. Obama cares about this country and its people, it clearly shows when he addresses us.Democrats show a deeper respect for the political process. In my experience, democrats are more willing to accept victory or defeat as long as the political process was carried out fairly. They value the system, when carried out properly, for the results that it produces. Republicans, on the other hand, do not respect the system. They are greedy, deceitful, and full of malice.I don't believe republicans are able to grasp reality if it doesn't line up neatly with their self interests. Democrats do not have this problem, they are far more willing to confront reality head on, and deal with real issues with real solutions.I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a world where everyone is at each others throats just to make a buck, where greed and deceit reign supreme. Obama is offering a clear alternative to the nightmarish reality that the republicans are offering. Obama's alternative has the United States seeking peace and cooperation, with honesty and mutual respect being its hallmarks, between ourselves and the rest of the world. Don't let the republicans steal this election. Obama is the superior choice.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney repeated a false claim Thursday night that Chrysler Group may move all Jeep vehicle production to China, drawing criticism from the Obama campaign, which said the Michigan native had blatantly skewed a news wire story.Romney?s comments came the same day that the Free Press reported that 1,100 new Chrysler workers will begin making the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs at a plant in Detroit next week.?I saw a story today that one of the great manufacturers in this state, Jeep, now owned by the Italians, is thinking of moving all production to China,? Romney said during a rally in Defiance, Ohio, before 12,000 cheering supporters, according to several reports. ?I will fight for every good job in America, I?m going to fight to make sure trade is fair, and if it?s fair, America will win.?Romney apparently was referencing conservative bloggers who misrepresented a Bloomberg story from Monday that discussed Chrysler?s decision to consider starting Jeep production in China, the world?s largest new-vehicle market.That story, while accurate, sparked a raft of other stories and blogs that incorrectly concluded that Chrysler might close plants or move Jeep production from the U.S. to China.Gualberto Ranieri, Chrysler?s vice president of communications, criticized those stories Thursday even before Romney made his comments.?Let?s set the record straight: Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China,? Ranieri said. ?It?s simply reviewing the opportunities to return Jeep output to China, for the world?s largest auto market. U.S. Jeep assembly lines will continue to stay in operation.?A spokesperson for the Romney campaign declined to comment.In fact, Chrysler is investing $500 million at its Toledo North Assembly Plant and plans to add 1,105 new workers by the third quarter of 2013 to build an all-new SUV that will replace the Jeep Liberty.Production of the new SUV will begin next summer and the hiring process for the new workers, who are scheduled to start by the next fall, has begun, said Chrysler spokeswoman Jodi Tinson.Romney?s comments were immediately skewered by auto industry observers and Romney?s political opponents because Chrysler added about 7,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009.The company is planning to add about 900 workers at its pickup plant in Warren by March.After Romney?s remarks, the Obama campaign quickly retorted, e-mailing reporters with the following statement, according to Politico: ?As Chrysler said today, ?Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.? And what?s more: President Obama has fought on behalf of U.S. auto workers by challenging unfair Chinese tariffs on U.S. auto exports to China, including Jeeps, while Romney would have let the American auto industry and a million jobs go under.?The spat between Romney and Obama over the government?s $85-billion bailout of General Motors and Chrysler intensified Monday during the final presidential debate.? Related story: Auto bailout could be key to Obama victory in OhioObama criticized Romney?s November 2008 New York Times op-ed article titled, ?Let Detroit Go Bankrupt? and said that under Romney, "we?d be buying cars from China instead of selling cars from China."Analysts agree that the Chinese auto industry is not advanced enough to sell cars in the U.S. However, many U.S. car companies produce cars in China to sell to Chinese consumers.During the debate, Romney said he was a ?son of Detroit? and ?I never said I would liquidate the industry." Obama came back: ?Governor, the people of Detroit don?t forget."Contact: Nathan Bomey at 313-223-4743 or nbomey@freepress.com. On Twitter, follow @NathanBomey or @freepautos.

To be king of the ballot on 6 November, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama must sway more than half the population –that is to say: women.But as with every previous election cycles, men have dominated the media narrative, even when it comes to women's issues. A study by 4th Estateshowed that 81% of people quoted about abortion in election news stories between November 2011 and May 2012 were male.So this week, an assortment of famous females have utilized their attention-attracting careers to try to tilt the balance of a campaign climate so heavily dominated by men.Tina Fey had her say on the issue Wednesday in a speech at the center for reproductive rights where she expressed her frustration at the legacy of men redefining rape. She specifically called out Missouri Republican representative Todd Akin who said in August that the female body is constructed to minimize the chance of getting pregnant from rape."Todd Akin claims that women can't really get pregnant from a legitimate rape because the body secretes hormones. Now I can't even finish this sentence without getting dumber; it's making me dumber when I say it – but it's something about the body not being able to get pregnant when it's under physical stress. Mr Akin, I think you are confusing the phrase 'legitimate rape' with the phrase 'competitive gymnastics'."Conservatives have pretty much abandoned Akin, so her comments passed by without much controversy. That could not be said for Lena Dunham's video endorsement of Obama which was released Friday.The video makes joking references to young women losing their virginity while talking about their "first time" voting.Conservative commentators quickly construed the video as a Democratic offense in the "war on women", for "mocking virgins" and "exploiting women".In a tweet that has since been taken down, a Minnesota Republican official said that the video shows Obama is being advised by Satan.Dunham was part of another filmed dispatch from the pro-Obama camp earlier this week when she and several other hip indie ladies teamed-up with Lesley Gore to sing You Don't Own Me as an anti-Romney video."I recorded You Don't Own Me in 1964. It's hard for me to believe, but we're still fighting for the same things we were then," Gore said at the end of the video. "Yes, ladies, we've got to come together, get out there and vote and protect our bodies. They're ours. Please vote."The video's appeal is pretty concentrated to the hipster crowd and was therefore able to avoid severe conservative criticism. Dissent could be found in the comments however, courtesy an alleged female commenter named Janet Lyons.Lyons said [sic]: "I believe videos like this are actually old fashion and condescending to women. We are not the oppressed and we should not sing battle cries acting as if we are! Bad message to young girls. Honestly I think it's Ridiculous!!!"Maybe Lyons is right. And maybe these women are all just ovulating.

If scientists were televangelists, they would be suggesting that Superstorm Sandy was punishment for climate change not being mentioned in any of the presidential or vice-presidential debates. This marks the first time that the issue wasn’t brought up in the debates since Ronald Reagan ran for re-election.Whether or not Sandy is a direct result of climate change is debatable, unlike the science that shows that inaction to prevent a climate crisis is the “gravest threat humanity faces.”In the aftermath of a hurricane that’s estimated to have caused $20 billion in damage, climate is suddenly a hot topic of conversation.You remember that in his speech at the Republican National Convention, Mitt Romney blasted the president for wanting to “begin to slow the rise of the oceans.”Tuesday in Minnesota, President Clinton noted, “In my part of America, we would’ve liked it if somebody could’ve done that yesterday.”Clinton praised the president’s policies to transition to green energy and added, “In the real world, Barack Obama’s policies work better.”The politics of the electoral college make talking about fighting carbon emissions nearly impossible, as it could alienate crucial votes in the coal regions of Ohio and Pennsylvania. But it’s important to remember Barack Obama’s record. According to Timemagazine’s Mike Grunwald – the author of the seminal book on the stimulus, The New, New Deal, “…he’s probably done more to prevent climate change than anyone else on the planet.”Who even comes close? Al Gore, maybe.In addition to the president’s new fuel standards that will save a whole year of carbon emissions by 2025, Grunwald points out that Obama is also responsible for untold innovations in green technologies:Basically, the president has launched several Manhattan Projects to get us to cleaner energy. But because of both the Republicans’ incredibly successful effort to brand the stimulus a failure and the electoral college, he can’t even mention them.Would a President Romney take credit for the progress that will emerge from these investments? Or would he reverse the new fuel standards and stamp out any progress he can?Bet on the latter. Since he began running for president, Romney has moved from a genuine green energy reformer to a tool of Big Oil’s agenda, even refusing to acknowledge that climate change is caused by human activity. His energy policies never even mention climate change or indicate that he would try to wean America off oil, as even George W. Bush used to suggest.Sandy reminds us what happens when we ignore climate change. But we also have to remember that the president’s actions to get us off oil and coal speak louder than words.

The CEO and founder of Papa John's pizza wants investors to know that when the president's health care law takes effect, the price of pizza is going up with it.According to "Papa" John Schnatter, the cost of providing health insurance for all of his pizza chain's uninsured, full-time employees comes out to about 14 cents on a large pizza. That's less than adding an extra topping and a third the price of an extra pepperoncini. If you want that piping hot pie delivered, the $2 delivery fee will cost you 14 times as much as that health insurance price hike."We're not supportive of Obamacare, like most businesses in our industry," Schnatter said on a conference call with shareholders last week, as reported by Politico."If Obamacare is in fact not repealed, we will find tactics to shallow out any Obamacare costs and core strategies to pass that cost onto consumers in order to protect our shareholders' best interests."The pizza place's Facebook page was soon littered with outraged pizza lovers proclaiming they would be "happy" to pay an extra 11 to 14 cents so Papa John's employees could have health insurance."I lose more than that in a week under my sofa cushion," one Facebook commenter wrote. "I'd gladly pay 20 cents for a child to go to a doctor when they've got a cold, rather than have them show up at the ER."Another said she's taking her money to another pizza restaurant, "one that doesn't begrudge their employees the ability to seek a doctor when they're ill."The company sought to clarify Schattner's comments on Wednesday, telling ABC News in a statement that Schnatter's remarks were in direct response to a question about the costs of complying with President Obama's health care law."We certainly understand the importance of healthcare to our customers, our employees, small business owners and their employees," the company said.But despite the pizza price increase, many of Papa John's employees may still go without employer-provided health insurance after the law takes effect in 2014. The company would not say how many of its employees are uninsured, but in 2010 the service industry had one of the lowest rates of insured employees, with 33 percent of the workforce uninsured, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Large businesses, those with more than 50 employees, are the only ones on the hook for providing health insurance under the health reform law. While Papa John's as a whole employs 16,500 people, 80 percent of the company's restaurants are independently owned franchises. As long as a franchise owner does not employ more than 50 people, he or she does not have to pay for employee health insurance.The Affordable Care Act only requires employers to offer health insurance to full-time employees, almost 90 percent of whom at large businesses like Papa John's corporate offices are already covered, according to a Treasury Department official.If the pizza company decides not to cover any full-time employees who are not currently insured, it will be hit with a $2,000 fine for each employee beyond the first 30 workers.

Republican governors got together in Las Vegas last week to take stock of the election results, which continue to sink in.Going into Election Day, Republican confidence was high that the Grand Old Party would sweep President Obama aside, retake the U.S. Senate and reshape the country in the aftermath.So on Nov. 6, when the results came in, many if not most Republicans were shocked by the president's victory. Pat McCrory, the newly elected governor of North Carolina, however, saw it coming."I knew it would be close. The Obama machine, the ground machine, is absolutely incredible," McCrory says. "I saw it in [2008], when I ran for governor and lost. ... I was blindsided by it. This time I wasn't blindsided by it, but I still think they have a much better ground machine than the Republican national party."McCrory's take on the ground game is both true, and for Republican governors, politically convenient. The consensus in Las Vegas was that Obama won, not because Americans agreed with his positions on raising taxes on the rich or health care, but because Republicans got out-organized by the community organizer. Therefore, the president has no election mandate, because the reason he won had nothing to do with issues.The other consensus was that Republican Mitt Romney wasn't a great presidential candidate."I really think this is not as much about Republican or Democrat, but about people are looking for leaders and they don't care what party they come from," he says. "I think what happened with Gov. Romney is he let himself be defined before he defined himself."This analysis also lets Republican Party ideology off the hook. It was widely agreed that nothing needed to be changed except perhaps the tone. For example, the idea that more than 70 percent of Hispanics voted for the president because of Republican positions on illegal immigration was rejected by the Republican governors.The accepted wisdom is that Republican candidates need to campaign harder, and let Hispanics know they really care about their vote. Then that vote will start coming the GOP's way."When I meet with many different immigration groups that come to our country, they're hard-working, strong morals, strong ethics, [and] strong family," McCrory says, "but we need to connect with them."The governors do acknowledge that elections have consequences, but how should the party proceed? Nothing unites Republicans like Obamacare, and not a single one of the 30 Republican governors would agree to implement a state-run exchange.The group sent the president a letter asking for more time and more information, but the governors also made it clear that most of them would do all they could to slow down or thwart the bill's implementation in their states.On the question of the coming so-called "fiscal cliff," they continued to emphasize the necessity of not raising taxes on the wealthy.Rep. Mike Pence is the newly elected governor of Indiana, but before he takes office he will be involved in the fiscal cliff negotiations in Washington. He says he'd try to keep an open mind, but told the assembled governors he brings a strong bias that "no country ever taxed its way back into prosperity.""I think most Americans know that," he said. "I think the last thing we ought to do is embrace any policy that would result in a significant tax increase, particularly upon those in the best position to put hurting Americans back to work."It may well be that the next Republican candidate for president will emerge from this large and strong group of conservative governors. The post-election rallying cry in Las Vegas was "no moderation" of the party's platform, and that a fresh face is all that's really needed.

  We have as bad of a disaster scenario as could have been predicted with Sandy. 7 million without power. Transportation systems crippled! The Eastern Coast of the United States needs FEMA more than ever! Mitt Romney`s June 2011 debate on CNN comes back to haunt him (a mere day before Halloween). Hey, we don`t need FEMA, let the State budgets take care of Sandy! Yea, right, as if they`re equipped to take care of The Storm of the Century, altering event! Romney wants to balance the budget, so FEMA has to go to the chopping block, while the military budget should get an unneeded 3% increase (according to Romney).    "Romney, you`re doing a heck of a job," I`ll jibe, even though Obama has reformed the Federal Emergency Management Agency from the ground up (since Katrina), as it prepares to take on some of the problems that confront the East Coast, as Sandy blows through the Northern corridor. Yea, tax cuts for the rich, so wealthy people can buy another resort home, so that when they`re crippled by a devastating natural disaster, they can flee to safety at their third or fourth alternative luxury palace.    Romney`s looking out for the Fat Cats, while poor people, the elderly, or the infirm will have to look out for themselves. We know the States are broke, so they can hardly fill in the gaps, should FEMA get the axe. As Mitt wakes up today, to the fires, the flooding, the crippling of New York City, I hope he`s turning an ashen grey, shaken with guilt, as the light comes on; only the Federal Government could mount such monumental efforts of relief, with a storm this big. The States couldn`t fix this great a disaster!    New Jersey Governor Chris Christie buckled under to the overwhelming pressure of Sandy, that would hit his state momentarily, when he opened up a hotline with the President, who was very sympathetic to the ensuing plight of New Jersey, pummeled as it was by the mighty winds and water of the merciless Frankenstorm, Lady Sandy. Estimates as of 5:27 AM CST, are 40 Billion in damage. In spite of this, Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said (to paraphrase), the states should still be the ones in charge of dealing with the storm.    This is a rare instance where Mitt doesn`t change his position, when the political realities dictate that he should do so (be a political turncoat [a flip-flopper] when it`s politically expedient). Ironically, this is seemingly the occasion when changing his position (midstream to the campaign) is a wise choice. Backing the relief efforts of FEMA, with so many voters in dire need of aid, is a good position to take, politically speaking. But no, we need more dollars for unneeded battleships, tanks, and bombers, even though the Pentagon is not asking for it (unless Mitt wants to get us in another war).    I don`t believe Romney will be able to show his face today; but don`t worry, he has plenty of opulent villas he can flee to, to hide out from his clumsy words, where the financially crippled states will take care of an epical storm, such as Sandy! It`s not going to happen, Mitt! Only the Federal Government can coordinate between the states, such a massive relief effort. *(The quicker systems can resume functionality, the more money will be saved, in the long run.)    Not that we should be politicizing Sandy, yet the election is only one week away, and like it or not, Sandy is wholly, totally political, since it forces our leaders to show how they will approach such a bigger than life problem. Katrina was George Bush`s worse moment (or one of his worse moments)! And this is not such a good time for Mitt either, especially given the timing, just 7 days before millions of Americans pull the lever. Romney comes off as callous and uncaring of those hit hardest. This is not trick mirrors; it`s the Real Mitt! He only cares about the Rich, since that`s the Class he`s fares from!

Update, October 29, 12:29 a.m. EST: With Hurricane Sandy set to make landfall in the Mid-Atlantic, Mitt Romney's policies for federal emergency management seem as relevant as ever. And the candidate's budget, as described below, isn't the only indication Romney would slash funding: As theHuffington Post'sRyan Grim noted, the presidential candidate suggested during a GOP primary debate that he would diminish the agency's role and leave responsibility for helping imperiled Americans to the states:When Republicans gather in Tampa next week for their national convention, they may have some unwelcome company. No, not Ron Paul's army of supporters—Tropical Storm Isaac, which is currently winding its way through the Caribbean, is expected to pick up hurricane status and slam into South and Central Florida—directly into Tampa, according to at least one model. What that means for the convention is unclear, but since a direct hit would likely flood most of the city, organizers, city and state officials, and relevant federal agencies are planning accordingly. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has downplayed the threat to the city, but is reportedly preparing to mobilize to assist in the disaster response in South Florida, should that become necessary.But under a Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan administration, FEMA's ability to respond quickly and effectively to natural disasters could be severely inhibited. In a 2012 report on Rep. Paul Ryan's "Path to Prosperity" roadmap (which Romney has said is similar to his own), the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that, due to the severe cuts to nonentitlement, nondefense spending, the costs for things like emergency management would have to be passed on to the states—which, with just a few exceptions, are currently in an even tighter financial bind than Washington."FEMA also helps states and local governments repair or replace public facilities and infrastructure, which often is not insured," the CBPP report explained. "This form of discretionary federal aid would be subject to cuts under the Ryan budget. If it were scaled back substantially, states and localities would need to bear a larger share of the costs of disaster response and recovery, or attempt to make do with less during difficult times."The Ryan budget makes no mention of FEMA or the Department of Homeland Security of which it's a part. In fact it makes no mention of any specific cuts to non-entitlement programs. We can't say for sure, in other words, the extent to which disaster funding would be scaled back. But the overall math suggests that it would be drastic. The Ryan budget proposes reducing total non-entitlement spending from 12 percent of GDP to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2050. As my colleague Kevin Drum put it:Defense spending alone amounts to 4% of GDP, and it's vanishingly unlikely that this will ever fall much below 2-3% of GDP. This means that all domestic spending will decline from about 8% of GDP to 1-2% of GDP by 2050. That's prisons, border control, education, the FBI, courts, embassies, the IRS, FEMA, housing, student loans, roads, unemployment insurance, etc. etc. It's everything. Whacked by about 80% or so.Romney's own proposed budget (which like Ryan's fails to identify specific cuts) would create much the same bind. Between 2013 and 2022, Romney would cut between $2 to $5 trillion more than Ryan from programs other than Social Security or defense. As the CBPP noted, "Romney's cuts would shrink non-defense discretionary spending…to between 1.1 percent and 1.6 percent of GDP." That's on top of the scheduled cuts agreed to in last year's budget deal.Just as Ryan's proposed Medicare expenditure would fail to keep up with rising medical costs, the GOP ticket's likely cuts to disaster management and weather forecasting budgets would come at a time in which, fueled by climate change, natural disasters are becoming increasingly more potent and expensive. There were 14 billion-dollar disasters in the United States in 2011—the most on record. For the GOP in Tampa, Hurricane Isaac isn't just a nuisance; it's the elephant in the room.

American doctors tend to be the highest paid in the world, with salaries that can double that of their counterparts outside the United States. That makes it all the more surprising that doctors here tend to have way lower rates of job satisfaction, according to new research from the Commonwealth Fund.The nonprofit surveyed primary care doctors in 10 industrialized countries. American doctors turned out to have the lowest rates of job satisfaction. When asked whether our health-care system worked well, about 15 percent agreed.It’s worth thinking a bit about the factors driving the low rates of satisfaction. It doesn’t seem to be salary: While primary care doctors earn less than specialists, their salaries still outpace those of their international counterparts.A lot of the frustration seems to stem from a lack of health-care access: In 2012, 59 percent of American doctors reported that their patients had difficulty paying for care. “Satisfaction with primary health care practice appears to be related to physicians’ perceptions of patients’ access to care,” the authors of this report write. “Within eight of the study countries (all but Australia and France), doctors concerned about patient access were significantly less likely to be satisfied with practicing medicine (data not shown).”The lack of access in the United States has a lot to do with our high uninsured rate. It also has to do with prices: the unit costs for health care are hugely higher in the United States than they are in other countries. A hip replacement in the United States can cost three times as much as it does in France. One other element tends to be a lack of coordination. The United States came in at the bottom of the pack when the Commonwealth Fund surveyed doctors on whether they got looped in on their patients’ care. Sixteen percent were informed when a patient’s drug regiment changed. Twenty-three percent said they would know if their patient had made a trip to the emergency room. You can see the full results here:The lack of coordination in the United States, coupled with the barriers to access, seem to be two of the key factors that have the vast majority of primary care doctors thinking that the health-care system we have right now just isn’t working.

(RNS) Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., the only openly atheist member of Congress, lost his race for another term on Tuesday (Nov. 6).But secularists will not remain unrepresented in the Capitol. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, a former Arizona state senator who was raised Mormon and is a bisexual, has narrowly won her pitch for a House seat by 2,000 votes."We are sad to see Pete Stark go," said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association, which gave Stark its Humanist of the Year award in 2008."He was a pioneer for us, and by being open about his lack of a belief in God we hope that he has opened the door for people like Kyrsten Sinema and others that will come after her."While Sinema's campaign was initially unavailable for comment after Tuesday's election, spokesman Justin Unga said Friday that Sinema does not consider herself a nonbeliever, adding that she prefers a "secular approach.''"Kyrsten believes the terms non-theist, atheist or nonbeliever are not befitting of her life's work or personal character,'' Unga said in email. "She does not identify as any of the above.''Stark, who turns 80 this year, is the dean of the California congressional delegation and has served Fremont, a religiously diverse community near San Jose, since 1972. He "came out" as a nonbeliever in 2007, and went on to win two re-election bids. But this time he faced recent redistricting and a fellow Democratic challenger, Eric Salwell, almost 50 years his junior."I don't think his lack of belief in a god had anything to do with the results of this election," Speckhardt said. "The numbers were close."But during the campaign, Salwell raised Stark's 2011 vote against reaffirming "In God We Trust" as the national motto, a vote in which he was joined by just eight other lawmakers. The outspoken Stark accused Salwell of taking bribes, an accusation which he eventually had to apologize for.Still, Speckhardt said Stark's achievements for nontheists include his opposition to the war in Iraq and his support of health care reform and civil rights. He also worked for congressional recognition of Darwin Day and the National Day of Reason, which nontheists observe to promote science education and critical thinking."Humanism is not just a lack of belief in God, it is a positive, progressive philosophy," Speckhardt said. "So for us, he has done things every day."Sinema, 36, has much in common with Stark ideologically. Having previously served as both an Arizona state senator and representative, she has a long record of supporting women's rights, marriage equality, gay rights and science education.Even though Sinema does not claim the atheist mantle, nontheist groups consider her one of their own."This is a step forward in that she was able to run openly as a nontheist and it didn't seem to be an issue," said Lauren Anderson Youngblood, communications manager for the Secular Coalition for America, whose Arizona branch supported Sinema's election. "That is a great thing for the community, especially because with the loss of Pete Stark, we are left with a big hole."Editor's note: The post has been updated to reflect input from the Sinema campaign about Sinema's beliefs.

This sad, ugly attack from the GOP trying to pin the murders of 4 Americans on President Obama is starting to backfire hard.I'm sure everyone saw the debate where Obama schooled Romney so hard on the Libya attacks and his exploitation of them to the point that it almost looked like Romney was going to cry... almost.Well its not looking any better for the GOP. This was the wrong fight to pick and now it is blowing up in their face....You read that right. As Romney and Ryan take turns slamming Obama over 4 Americans killed at our embassy in Libya, Paul Ryan voted to cut over $400 Million from foreign embassy safety funding. You know, funding used to prevent attacks from happening.The same goes for Darrell Issa, the GOP's head witch hunter.They have the nerve to bitch that there should have been more protection at the embassy after they cut $400 Million from funding that would have provided more protection.Maybe they'll now understand why running through a budget with a machete and cutting everything in sight probably isn't a good idea.I think the GOP should apologize to the family members affected by this attack, A) for politicizing their deaths and using it to falsely smear Obama B) for cutting funding that would have been used to prevent this attack and possibly saved their lives.I also think they should apologize to President Obama and his Administration.Trying to pin these murders on Obama and use it against him is a pretty cold move.When 3,000 Americans were killed on US soil, we didn't use it to try to bring down a President we didn't like (and didn't even win). We came together and out our differences aside. I have no confidence or proof that Republicans would do the same if the tables were turned.The Iraq war is what polarized Bush and turned half the country against him. Amongst other things...Obama deserves an apology from Mitt Romney and the GOP for using a tragedy to try and smear him when the House GOP voted to cut funding that may have prevented that tragedy.But once again... I won't hold my breath.

The October surprise has arrived. Let’s give Chris Christie and Barack Obama credit. They lead. They collaborate. They act. They do what Americans want political leaders to do: work together at a time of crisis. Meanwhile, the ubiquitous and disastrous Bush appointee and Romney supporter Michael Brown, known as "Brownie,” attacks the president for his excellent leadership during the hurricane crisis. And again Mitt Romney acts in character. He pandered to the right during the primaries by calling for the privatization of FEMA. He named as his running mate Paul Ryan, who favors decimating FEMA with devastating cutbacks. Romney spent Tuesday looking like a defendant on a perp walk refusing to answer at least 11 questions about his now-secret views on disaster relief.The president is being the president. Mitt Romney is being the panderer. Brownie, God's gift to Democrats in the closing days of the campaign, reminds voters of the difference between the way President Obama has masterfully handled the crisis and the way President George W. Bush mismanaged Katrina.I feel Charles Krauthammer's pain. The leading conservative columnist finds himself allied with Brownie attacking the president for his masterful handling of the crisis, while the influential conservative New Jersey governor, Christie, who gave the keynote speech at the GOP convention, has earned high praise for his own masterful and compassionate handling of the crisis and his professionalism and integrity in working with and praising President Obama.Let’s give credit where it is due. I have not been the biggest fan of Chris Christie, but he has handled the hurricane crisis with strong management and a compassionate demeanor. Christie reaches out to all New Jersey citizens with the professionalism and integrity to rise above politics even when this means praising a president of the other party, in the closing days of a campaign, because his praise of President Obama is earned.And let’s say a few words about Mitt Romney. It is true Romney called for cutting the FEMA role. It is true that Romney called for privatizing FEMA and turning key functions of disaster relief over to profit-making companies. It is true that Romney named as his running mate Paul Ryan, who proposed cutting the FEMA budget by a devastating 35 percent, which would not be appreciated by those needing disaster relief from Ohio to Virginia and from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin.Didn't Romney look ridiculous running away from reporters asking him where he stands on disaster relief? The president acts like the president. The Republican does the perp walk.While Barack Obama and Chris Christie rise to the occasion and lead, the best thing I can say about Romney during this crisis is this:To amend what Bogart said to Bergman in “Casablanca,” at least Romney will always have Brownie.

If Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are elected, they plan to engineer the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the rich in American history.Sure George W. Bush cut taxes on the rich, which led to the greatest inequality since before the Great Depression. But he grew government spending and expanded Medicare at the same time. Romney and Ryan want to cut taxes on the richest by billions and then gut every government service that helps working families—Pell grants, Headstart, Medicaid, education, on and on.That’s their plan–on their website. Experts say they’ll have to raise taxes on the middle class. They claim they’ll cut them by maybe a few hundred dollars a year. Even if they do, what they promise to take away is the greatest victory for the middle class since Medicare—the Affordable Care Act.IF the Affordable Care Act goes into effect, 30 million Americans will join the millions that are now covered by the law. This will make a huge dent in the 26,000-45,000 Americans who die a year for lack of insurance.But there are two aspects of ObamaCare that will fundamentally change the way middle class Americans live–enhancing your freedom to pursue what we can only call happiness.The first is the freedom of fear when you get sick. Countless Americans avoid going to a doctor for fear of the costs or being branded with a pre-existing condition. ObamaCare ends lifetime caps on coverage, makes it illegal for insurance companies to drop you or deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.The other freedom ObamaCare offers is the chance to create your own business without fear of losing or not being able to afford your family’s health insurance.If President Obama wins, this future is certain. If Mitt Romney wins, even if he has a Democratic Senate, he can begin canceling huge parts of the law with executive orders.Beyond health care, President Obama’s plans call on the rich to pay a bit more to balance with the cuts we’ll have to make to the size of government programs. Romney has promised that in addition to his cuts, he’ll slash whole programs, whole departments he won’t name.Under Romney the trend toward privatizing everything the government does – another way to transfer trillions to the richest—will get a turbo boost as he slashes oversights on Wall Street and the environment. And based on his 17 Bush/Cheney advisers, we can assume that dumb war is inevitable, if not the plan.President Obama’s goal is to stop the wars so we can stop the war spending and use that money to rebuild infrastructure. He plans to put teachers back to work and help make college affordable for people who can’t borrow $10 millionfrom their parents.And women will still have the right to make their own private health care decisions.If you look at President Obama’s plan for his second term, just not being Mitt Romney would be enough. But what’ he’s offering is a chance to improve life for the middle class the same way Medicare and Social Security improved life for the elderly.We’re not just voting to not go back. We’re fighting for a future worth living.

One of the most tantalizing subplots of the 2012 campaign has been the curious and sometimes controversial performances of New Jersey Gov. ChrisChristie. Now, campaign insiders tell POLITICO that Christie was Mitt Romney’s first choice for the Republican ticket, lending an intriguing new context to the continuing drama around the Garden State governor.The strong internal push for Christie, and Romney’s initial instinct to pick him as his running mate, reflects how conflicted the nominee remained about choosing a running mate until the very end of the process. At least on the surface, Christie and Paul Ryan are about as opposite as two Republicans could be: a brash outsider from the Northeast versus a bookish insider from the heartland.And yet Romney switched from Christie to Ryan in a span of about two weeks, according to a detailed inside account provided to POLITICO.Romney was so close to picking Christie that some top advisers at the campaign’s Boston headquarters believed the governor had been offered the job. The campaign made tentative plans to announce a pick in late July, just before Romney headed off on his overseas trip, starting with a stop at the London Olympics.“Mitt liked him because he saw him as a street fighter,” a Romney official said. “It’s the kind of political mentality that Romney doesn’t have, but admires. He wanted someone who could play the Chicago game [like Obama headquarters] on its own terms.”(Also on POLITICO: Obama and Christie: A Sandy love story)In fact, Christie was never the final choice. Romney hit “pause” on the possibility shortly before his trip to the Olympics. Then he settled on Ryan the day after returning. Romney formally offered him the job within a week, leaving Christie hanging until shortly before the official announcement a week later.Some Christie supporters were irritated to discover that the House budget chairman had been picked so long before the New Jersey governor had been told, meaning that he and other also-rans had remained as decoys. These supporters said at the time that Christie deserved more of a heads -up after being led on so strongly.People involved in the selection process said the campaign believed there was no one who would be more adept and persuasive at delivering Romney’s message. Advisers thought Christie would excel at retail campaigning among working-class voters.(Also on POLITICO: Christie aide denies rift with Mitt)“He’d be great anywhere there are ordinary white men,” the official said. “They would have loved him because here’s this straight-talking, hard-charging, in-your-face guy, and he’s a man’s man. Ohio is the only battleground state where Mitt has a net negative gender gap — where his approval among men doesn’t outweigh the president’s approval among women. Chris Christie changes that.”Christie started the campaign season by flirting with his own run for president, then ended it with effusive praise for the man he would have run against — and starred in several campaign dramas in between. In typical Christie fashion, there has been nothing understated about his role at each critical point, culminating with his tour with President Barack Obama on Marine One this week as they surveyed Sandy’s havoc along the Jersey Shore.

Sarah Palin has said a lot of outrageous things about President Obama.  She tapped into the racist lexicon to accuse him of a “shuck and jive” regarding Libya; she urged Mitt Romney to specifically use words like “incompetent, dangerous, socialist” to describe him;  and she accused him of using Hurricane Sandy as photo op.But if Sarah Palin were paying attention to the needs and best interests of her home state of Alaska, it would not be outrageous for her to endorse President Obama for reelection.  In fact, it would be entirely sensible and sane.  Ironically, most red states that vote for Republican leaders fare better economically under Democrats.  In fact, under President Obama, Alaska has fared even better than most.Alaska received more stimulus dollars per capita than any other state in the nation.  For instance, as of August of 2010 (when the bulk of stimulus spending had been dispatched), Alaska had an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent (two points below the national average) but received $3,145 per person in federal stimulus dollars.  But Florida, with an unemployment rate at 11.4 percent got just $914 in per capita stimulus spending.  And, incidentally, Alaska is not a poor state — with oil revenues that make up 88 percent of the state’s general fund.Red states generally receive more federal spending than they pay in taxes.  In 2005, Alaska received $1.84 in spending for every $1 paid in taxes).  Other red states fared just as well, for instance: North Dakota ($1.68), Alabama ($1.66), Kentucky ($1.51), Oklahoma ($1.36).  Blue states tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in spending, for instance:  Connecticut (received $0.69 for every $1 in taxes paid), Illinois ($0.75), California ($0.78), New York ($0.79).   In 2012, the New York Times published an eye-opening study revealing that Americans in conservative parts of the country — including the voting bases of the most anti-government Tea Party candidates — use more government benefits (including Medicare and Social Security and unemployment insurance) than more liberal parts of the nation.Blue state taxes are literally subsidizing red state schools and roads while red states complain about taxes and government.And liberal policies are better for red states in general.  Between 1957 and 2007, unemployment was lower and economic growth was higher when Democrats were president (while, incidentally, federal taxes and spending were fairly constant and irrelevant of which party was in power).  Historically, the average incomes of middle-class families grew twice as fast under Democratic presidents.  The incomes of poor families grew nine times faster when Democrats were in the White House.  In fact, the stock market even does better when Democrats is president.  From farms to factories, the working-class states of America fare better when Democrats are at the helm of our nation. I know Sarah Palin and I know she is proud to be a maverick.  Perhaps in this election, the maverick thing to do would be acknowledge facts.  The fact is that all the folks relying on the manufacturing comeback, most of the Americans who are uninsured, many who can’t send their kids to college without more Pell Grants — these people don’t live in New York City or Los Angeles but places like Albuquerque and Fayetteville and Wasilla.  And as much as Palin and her fellow Republicans like to scream until they’re red in the face about the dangers of economic redistribution, the fact is that redistribution is what allows New Mexico and North Carolina and Alaska to even survive.  That survival is literally paid for by Democrats. Want to say thank you, red America?  Vote for the party that’s actually helping you out. And Gov. Palin, I look forward to your endorsement of President Obama.

DESTIN — When Legendary employees received their paychecks Friday, they also found a photocopy of CEO Peter Bos’ sample ballot — with ovals filled in — for Tuesday’s general election.The ballot was accompanied by a two-page letter from Bos urging his employees to vote with the economy in mind.“I am constantly asked about my feelings regarding the upcoming elections,” he wrote. “To date, I have refrained from advising anyone. … However, this election is different.”Bos, whose ballot selected Mitt Romney for president, told employees that the election is about “selecting people that can determine the direction for the USA.”But some Legendary employees didn’t appreciate the memo — or Bos sharing his personal political leanings.“Immediately, I thought that was wrong,” said Aleshia Silva, who works at the Emerald Grande. “Your opinion is your opinion, but I don’t think it’s right to attach your ballot to your employees’ paychecks.”Bos could not be reached for comment Monday.Silva, who works in the housekeeping department, said voting is a personal matter and that political discussions often are inappropriate in the workplace.“We have over 600 employees, and they’re not only Republicans,” she said. “Your opinion is your own.”“You cannot force it on us like this,” added Nicole Alexander, also a Legendary employee.Okaloosa County Supervisor of Elections Paul Lux said Bos “is free to communicate his opinions in any way he wants to.”“He can plaster them on walls of his buildings if he so chooses,” Lux said.But letters like the one Bos sent point out why there is a provision in the law that says an employer is one person not allowed to accompany employees to the voting booth, Lux said.“It is not necessarily a violation of any kind to tell people how you would like them to vote,” he added. “In the end, they have no way of verifying what you did with your ballot.”Lux said he would be “leery” of sharing a filled-out sample ballot with employees.“I can certainly see where there are grounds for them to think this is some sort of veiled intimidation,” he said.Silva said she has always planned to vote in today’s election.“I encourage people to vote, but I don’t encourage people who to vote for,” she said. “I’ve never had an employer do this before.”Contact Daily News Staff Writer Kari Barlow at 850-315-4438 or kbarlow@nwfdailynews.com.

see more posts by Sarah JonesIn a flood of new endorsements for Obama, the consensus is that Obama has a vision for this country while Romney stands for nothing except a belief that he should be president.While we’ve been focused on swing state endorsements, Obama also got an endorsement from the conservative LA Times in which they write that Romney’s ever-changing positions leave the impression that “the only thing he really stands for is his own election.” Additionally the Sante Fe New Mexican wrote passionately about the President’s gutsy leadership in getting Osama and Obama’s slow and steady approach that is focused on the needs of the country, working for the collective good.The Sante Fe New Mexican endorsed President Obama for a second term, saying his steady leadership stayed focused on the collective good. They note Obama’s gutsy leadership in getting Osama bin Laden:He inherited an unholy mess — an economy teetering on the edge of a second Great Depression and two foreign wars top the list of disasters. Slowly, steadily and with his eye fixed firmly on the needs of the country, the president has worked hard every day to improve our collective good. It was President Obama who bailed out the auto industry, salvaging 1.1 million jobs and keeping manufacturing alive in this country. It was President Obama who made the gutsy call to invade a compound in Pakistan, tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden. It was President Obama who finally signed comprehensive health reform so that no American has to fear bankruptcy because of a medical catastrophe. More work remains for a second term… So much accomplished in four years. So much remaining to be done.The conservative LA Times (yes, Virginia, conservatives do have a voice in Los Angeles) that Murdoch is eyeing up to buy in order to spread his filthy propaganda endorsed Obama, saying Romney is flat out wrong on the issues and his willingness to pander raise questions about who he is.Republicans have sought to make the presidential election an up-or-down vote on Obama, hoping that voters will hold him accountable for the country’s stubbornly high unemployment and sluggish economy. But this election isn’t a referendum on one candidate, it’s a choice between two. And unfortunately for the GOP, its candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, has demonstrated clearly that he’s the wrong choice. He’s wrong on the issues, from immigration to tax policy to the use of American power to gay rights and beyond. And his shifting positions and willingness to pander have raised questions about who he is and what he stands for.They call Romney out for not standing for anything other than his own reelection:The most troubling aspect of Romney’s candidacy is that we still don’t know what his principles are. Is he the relatively moderate Republican who was governor of Massachusetts, the “severely conservative” one on display in the GOP primaries or the more reasonable-sounding fellow who reappeared at the presidential debates? His modulating positions on his own tax plan, healthcare reform, financial regulation, Medicare, immigration and the national safety net add to the impression that the only thing he really stands for is his own election.Repeatedly, the editorials endorsing Obama call Mitt Romney out for standing for nothing but his own election. He is a man who has shown himself to have no core convictions other than a belief that he is entitled to the White House. On the other hand, we have President Obama who is praised for his guiding principles of working for the common good of all Americans, his steady hand on a teetering economy, and his diplomatic finesse in foreign relations.The Republicans put up a candidate who quite simply has offered the American people nothing but his belief in his entitlement to the White House.

They're just trying to create reasons for people to be angry that Obama won.People might argue that Romney promised to repeal the PPACA ("Obamacare") but that's not really in his power: it would take an act of congress to write a new law repealing the old law, which would have to got through a full vote, and there's no guarantee such a thing would pass. IF such a law were to make it to Romney's desk, he might sign it, but Romney has also articulated that he actually agrees with most of the provisions of the PPACA.The only specifics Romney mentioned that he was directly opposed to were the contraceptive coverage mandate and the individual mandate. If the PPACA were kept in place and just those revisions were repealed, it would have pretty much no effect on the price of insurance to businesses.Furthermore, I strongly suspect these layoffs were actually by the suggestion of the republican leadership, in which case the republicans have literally colluded to kill jobs just to make people angry at Obama.Check wikipedia's article on the PPACA to see what provisions took/take effect when. No new provisions till January, last new provision was a month ago. Nothing new has happened with this law requiring urgent layoffs or price changes.TL;DR: The businesses that have been in the news lately don't really give a shit about Obamacare or they would have taken these steps months/years ago. They just want to sully Obama's reelection and provide ammunition for the republicans in 4 years.Republicans hate Obama more than they love America.EDIT: In case anyone's confused, I'm only talking about the businesses that have been in the news lately. These guys are compiling a list which will direct you to the pertinent news stories if you're not up to date.

About a month ago, I wrote about a Catholic Bishop in Illinois who warned his parishioners that their souls might be in danger if they vote for Obama. It’s happened again – this time in the neighboring state of Wisconsin.Bishop David L. Ricken of the Green Bay Diocese sent this email to his congregation (emphasis added):It is almost time to vote and to make our choices for president and other political offices both local and national.You have often heard it said that this is a turning point in our country’s history and I could not agree more.The Church is not a political organism, but as you hopefully have learned in the US Bishops FaithfulCitizenship material (which we have made widely available to you in the parishes, in the Compass and on-line),the Church has the responsibility to speak out regarding moral issues, especially on those issues that impact the “common good” and the “dignity of the human person.”I would like to review some of the principles to keep in mind as you approach the voting booth to complete your ballot. The first is the set of non-negotiables. These are areas that are “intrinsically evil” and cannot be supported by anyone who is a believer in God or the common good or the dignity of the human person.These are intrinsically evil. “A well-formed Christian conscience does not permit one to vote for a political program that contradicts fundamental contents of faith and morals.” Intrinsically evil actions are those which have an evil object. In other words, an act is evil by its very nature and to choose an action of this type puts one in grave moral danger.But what does this have to do with the election? Some candidates and one party have even chosen some of these as their party’s or their personal political platform. To vote for someone in favor of these positions means that you could be morally “complicit” with these choices which are intrinsically evil. This could put your own soul in jeopardy.The other position to keep in mind is the protection of religious liberty. The recent aggressive moves by the government to impose the HHS mandate, especially the move to redefine religion so that religion is confined more and more to the four walls of the Church, is a dangerous precedent. This will certainly hurt the many health care services to the poor given by our Catholic hospitals. Our Catholic hospitals in the Diocese give millions of dollars per year in donated services to the poor. In the new plan, only Catholic people can be treated by Catholic institutions.It has never been our mission to be exclusive of those who are not of our faith. This mandate also places Catholic business owners in a very precarious position in that they, too, will have to pay for those medical “services” which violate Catholic teaching. This has never been the American way and now these moves and others by the present government, will significantly alter and marginalize the role of religious institutions in our society.These positions are indicators of a broader societal disposition to remove God from the public square and from any relation to society whatever. It is precisely religion and the free exercise thereof which has made this country great in the past.Many people in our Diocese are presently without work. Our Catholic Charities is serving more and more people who are unemployed or under employed and can barely keep up with the demands. Work is so critical to the family and to the sense of human dignity. An economy which does the most for the common good is an economy that works and provides people gainful employment for the country’s citizens. A government that works pays its bills and models for citizens what it means to be responsible and contributive.Let us pray for the electorate and let’s take action, that we may vote for good and moral leaders for this great country which will only remain great, if she continues to be and to do the good.
