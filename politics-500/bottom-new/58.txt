With Election Day taking place in the United States tomorrow (Nov. 6), Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney is getting exponentially more heated. As one of the few subjects that truly divides groups of human begins into two halves, politics constantly draws passionate statement from people of all backgrounds. One of those backgrounds happens to be playing bass and providing vocals for Motorhead, with the legendary Lemmy Kilmister offering his two cents on the election.

During a recent discussion with Rolling Stone, Lemmy was talking about his inclusion for a Chuck Berry tribute concert. During the conversation, Rolling Stone journalist Patrick Doyle shared an experience he had while interviewing Berry, who teared up while saying, “My dad said, ‘I don’t know if we’ll live to see it, but one day we will [have an African-American President] – and thank God that I have.’”

Lemmy responded to the story with a passionate statement of his own. “I would have said America wasn’t ready for it. And I don’t think they were, because they’re trying to drag him down now,” begins Lemmy. “I mean, the poor f—er’s only just gotten rid of all that George Bush s–t that he left, or is trying to. And he’s being stonewalled by the f—ing Congress all the time. I don’t know how he’s gotten anything done. They should be glad. I mean the alternative is Mitt Romney. Please, please don’t vote for Mitt Romney. F— him. Repeal abortion law is the first thing he’ll do. F—ing monster.”

When Lemmy was asked whether he had been watching the debates, the musician responded, “I couldn’t bear it.”

Be sure to head out and vote tomorrow (Nov. 6), but in the meantime, make sure you cast your vote for our President of Heavy Metal election. Lemmy almost made it to the final round, but was defeated by Rob Zombie, who faces Ozzy Osbourne for the sacred title.
