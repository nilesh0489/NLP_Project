They're just trying to create reasons for people to be angry that Obama won.

People might argue that Romney promised to repeal the PPACA ("Obamacare") but that's not really in his power: it would take an act of congress to write a new law repealing the old law, which would have to got through a full vote, and there's no guarantee such a thing would pass. IF such a law were to make it to Romney's desk, he might sign it, but Romney has also articulated that he actually agrees with most of the provisions of the PPACA.

The only specifics Romney mentioned that he was directly opposed to were the contraceptive coverage mandate and the individual mandate. If the PPACA were kept in place and just those revisions were repealed, it would have pretty much no effect on the price of insurance to businesses.

Furthermore, I strongly suspect these layoffs were actually by the suggestion of the republican leadership, in which case the republicans have literally colluded to kill jobs just to make people angry at Obama.

Check wikipedia's article on the PPACA to see what provisions took/take effect when. No new provisions till January, last new provision was a month ago. Nothing new has happened with this law requiring urgent layoffs or price changes.

TL;DR: The businesses that have been in the news lately don't really give a shit about Obamacare or they would have taken these steps months/years ago. They just want to sully Obama's reelection and provide ammunition for the republicans in 4 years.

Republicans hate Obama more than they love America.

EDIT: In case anyone's confused, I'm only talking about the businesses that have been in the news lately. These guys are compiling a list which will direct you to the pertinent news stories if you're not up to date.
