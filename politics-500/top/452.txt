In 1978 Florida switched from an election system to a merit retention system for its Justices. The reason was to prevent political pressure from affecting judicial decisions. The state supreme court has overturned controversial and unconstitutional legislative proposals and amendments in recent years. Now groups such as American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity have spent thousands of dollars in advertisements to smear the reputation and character of these judges.

The Republicans have the governor's seat and a super-majority in the legislature and have also placed an amendment making it easier to overturn a judicial ruling. If you are not happy with Governor Scott and the way Florida is run it is vital the judges be retained.
