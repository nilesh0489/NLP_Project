Previously /r/Politics had done threads for the Presidential (first and second) and theVice Presidential Debate. Those went very well.

So, we are back for the third and final one tonight.

The format for this debate will be like the first one, and will focus on foreign policy.

Places you can watch the debate:

As was true the other times, we are going to be moderating this thread heavily. If you see something that you feel should be brought to mod attention quickly, then please report it / message the mods ASAP.

And, even though this should go without saying, please observe the Reddiquette. Please vote based on comments that contribute to the discussion as a whole. We would like all sides of the political spectrum to be properly represented here. In short, please don't use the voting arrows as synonymous for agreement or disagreement with the point being made.

(Please up vote this thread as we gain no karma from it, and the discussion and interaction should be good for everyone involved.)
