The United States Secret Service is investigating a Turlock woman over a post she made, using the N-word, about President Obama on Facebook.

“Another 4 years of this (N-word),” Denise Helms wrote. “Maybe he will get assassinated this term.”

The post, which has since been taken down, went up right after the president won his second term Tuesday night.

“I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal,” Helms told FOX40.

Even though Helms removed the post from her profile, she’s not going to apologize.

“The assassination part is kind of harsh,” Helms said. “I’m not saying I’d go do that or anything like that, by any means, but if it was to happen I don’t think I’d care one bit.”

“Really? It wouldn’t bug you if someone assassinated the president?” FOX40 asked.

“Well, it’s not something I would dwell on. It’s not something I would be upset about,” Helms responded.

The Washington, D.C. bureau of the Secret Service told FOX40 that all threats, or perceived threats, are taken seriously and investigated, but did not comment further.

Helms doesn’t think her words were threatening.

“I don’t understand what I did wrong. I didn’t say, ‘Hey, someone go do this,’” Helms told FOX40.

Helms also said that, despite using a racial slur, she doesn’t consider herself racist.

Legally, Helms probably won’t get in trouble for her comments. If the Secret Service perceives her as a credible threat, she faces a Class D felony charge.
