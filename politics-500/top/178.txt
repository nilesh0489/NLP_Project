On XM radio, Chris Russo interviewed NJ Governor Christie.. For this who don't know.. Russo is a sports talk show host.. And in my opinion, an amazing interviewer.. Russo has ties to the Nj shore and a host on his station is friendly with Christie, so he got Christie on..

It was a great interview. Christie praised President Obama for his assistance.. He admitted they don't agree on much but in this matter Obama has been amazing and has helped in many ways, not just words.

Russo wanted to be fair so he asked Christie about Mitt and if Mitt had called him. Answer "Governor Romney last called me on Sunday as Sandy was approaching",

Ouch.. No call to check and see how the state was... Granted mitt isn't President but it struck me as a terse answer and Chrisie seemed unimpressed.. Russo didn't press it and moved on

All in all a great interview.. NJ shore has been wrecked (like other areas)...
