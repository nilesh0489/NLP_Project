Being in the UK, I know that if something like that were to happen in our elections, there would be quite a media shitstorm, but why isn't this such a big thing in the US? Trying not to make this look like an imperialist-jerk here (what ho) but the state of US politics is in a bit of a mess. Could you fellas explain to me how they actually get away with the rigging?
