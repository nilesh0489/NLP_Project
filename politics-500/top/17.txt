You might remember that last month we reported on Colleen Lachowicz, a Democratic candidate for the State Senate in Maine. Lachowicz was the subject of an intensive mail campaign and accusations by the state Republican Party that she was unfit for office due to her gaming hobby, especially her time spent playing World of Warcraft.

Turns out, however, that Maine voters either didn't care, or are a big fan of orcish rogues.

Lachowicz, as you may have guessed, won her race for State Senate. But it was a rockier road than you might expect.

After her story broke, Lachowicz was deluged with offers of donations, but had taken a campaign pledge to not accept any donations for her campaign. So she posted a message on her Facebook page asking would-be backers to direct their support to ActBlue, a political action committee… and was promptly accused of improperly coordinating with the committee by the state GOP.

Lachowicz was cleared of all charges by the state election commission and proceeded to beat her opponent, Tom Martin, by 913 votes. She'll be representing Kennebec and Somerset counties.

Our Take: We're wondering, did the guy who commissioned this stunt get fired after it so spectacularly backfired? Or did he get fired for losing the election?
