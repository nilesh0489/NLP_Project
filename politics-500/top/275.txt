Mitt Romney has won one election in his life, and the state that elected him now rejects him by a nearly 2-1 margin. Why?

One thing that Mitt Romney does consistently, whether he’s playing moderate or severely conservative, is lie.

His strategic confusion is probably geared to get people to talk about what he’s saying and not what he’d do—transfer ridiculous amounts of wealth from the middle class to the richest.

During the last debate, the president finally got the chance to rebut Romney’s biggest lie of the campaign—that the president went on “an apology tour” because he didn’t praise George W. Bush’s policies.

“Nothing Gov. Romney just said is true,”the president said, “starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper that’s been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact-checker and every reporter who has looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.

Since we can’t rebut Romney to his face, we figure a little mockery is the next best thing.

“nobsartist” helped us trump Trump’s ridiculous announcement by suggesting that Mr. Romney’s Donald Trump association is as more than supporters and neither has a birth certificate he could produce.

Now we want to know what you think Mitt’s next lie will be.
