Todd Akin and Joe Walsh, here’s a third member for your posse. Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said Tuesday that pregnancy resulting from rape can be “something that God intended to happen.” The comments came during a debate. “I came to realize life is that gift from God,” he said. “And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.” The Romney campaign immediately issued a statement distancing themselves from the candidate, saying "Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock's comments, and they do not reflect his views." Talk about déjà vu.
