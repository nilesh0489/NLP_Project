President Barack Obama holds a 5-point lead in Ohio, according to a poll released Monday.

In the latest poll released jointly by Quinnipiac University and the CBS News, Obama leads Mitt Romney among likely Buckeye State voters 50 percent to 45 percent. While the lead is outside the poll's margin of error, it represents a dip from the previous Quinnipiac/CBS survey in September that showed Obama up by 10 in Ohio

Monday's poll shows Obama leading big among early voters in Ohio, 54 percent to 39 percent, while also holding a smaller 2-point edge among those who intend to cast their ballots on Election Day.

The PollTracker Average currently shows the president with a little more than a 2-point lead in Ohio, placing the state in the "leans Obama" category on the TPM Electoral Scoreboard.
