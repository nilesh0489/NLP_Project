Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) is the latest Republican to refute one of Mitt Romney’s biggest talking points in the state, as he told CBS Monday morning that Chrysler is adding jobs in Ohio, not shipping them to China as Romney has claimed both on the campaign trail and in radio and television ads:

ANCHOR: And is Jeep creating more jobs in Ohio or are they sending them to China? KASICH: No. Chrysler has, has — Chrysler is the one automaker that has increased employment.

After Romney’s claims led to auto workers calling their employers because they feared for their jobs, Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchione wrote a letter to the Detroit News refuting Romney. “Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand,” Marchione wrote. “It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.” He also noted, as Kasich said, that Chrysler has added American jobs since the auto industry rescue: “With the increase in demand for our vehicles, especially Jeep branded vehicles, we have added more than 11,200 U.S. jobs since 2009.”

While some Republicans continue to defend Romney, at least six others have repeatedly contradicted his claims about the auto bailout that saved Chrysler and General Motors.
