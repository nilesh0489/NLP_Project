President Obama called voting “the best revenge” on Friday at a rally in Ohio.

The line was a twist on Obama’s usual “don’t boo, vote” line that the president uses when crowds at this rallies boo Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s name.

“No, no, no, Don't boo. Vote,” Obama told a crowd in Springfield, Ohio. “Voting is the best revenge.”

But Republicans immediately pushed back on the comment.

“Obama would be using a plan to move our country forward as a motivator to get people to the polls if he had one -- not revenge,” said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokesperson for the Republican National Convention.

“So much for hope and change, now all Obama has is revenge.”
