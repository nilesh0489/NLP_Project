Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren is hitting 50 percent in a poll released Wednesday, topping Republican Sen. Scott Brown by 6 percentage points.

Warren is leading 50 percent to 44 percent, including leaners, in a poll conducted for WBUR. The radio station’s previous poll had Warren trailing, 47 percent to 43 percent.

Warren has opened up a convincing lead among women, 52 percent to 39 percent, as she attacks Brown for not standing up for abortion rights and equal pay in the Senate. Brown leads among men by a mere 2 points: 44 percent to 42 percent.

The poll of 507 likely voters was conducted October 21-22 and has a 4.4 percentage point margin of error.
