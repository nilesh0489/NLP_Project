EDIT: I'd like to specially thank very_easily_confused for his very insightful statement

Due to the seperation of church and state, this church has never paid a cent in taxes. As churches like this across the country increasingly inject themselves into the political process it becomes clear that they are picking and choosing where the seperation of church and state lies. It is time to end the tax-exempt status of religious organizations in the U.S. as they do not respect the boundaries any longer. This is a vast, untapped source of revenue for our ailing economy.

EDIT: Hey, this has turned into a very cool discussion. I've given upvotes to everyone who had anything more to say than "STFU numbnuts" I respect all of your opinions and I'm glad you shared them. After participating in the discussion, I believe that it is probably a better idea for the IRS to enforce the laws that are on the books already... it would be unfair and unreasonable to tax all religious organizations. Thank you all for participating.
