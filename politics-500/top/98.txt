Just last week, 10-year-old Sophia Bailey-Klugh wrote and illustrated an endearing letter to U. S. President  Barack Obama and, as the daughter of a gay couple, thanked him for supporting same-sex marriage.

Note: Obama's response has since been verified as genuine by an official spokesperson. Transcripts follow each letter.
