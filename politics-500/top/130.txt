Conservatives always talk about personal responsibility, but when it comes to healthcare, that's all it is: talk. When one of them comes whining to you about the cost of Obamacare to their business ask them, "Who is paying for your employees' healthcare right now?"

Oh, that's right, me.

Conservatives hate talking about reducing costs. When they say that, what they mean is that they want to pass the burden to the taxpayer, and keep the resulting profit for themselves.
