Martin Sheen is thoroughly unimpressed with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

“He is, in essence, a very arrogant, very successful businessman [who] believes in unreined free enterprise,” the “West Wing” star recently told The Huffington Post. “He doesn’t have a clue what 99 percent of the people are going through. He’s never lived on that level. He’s never had to compete for a job or face eviction or struggle to get a college loan. He’s a guy that the old phrase applies to: ‘He was born on third base and thought he hit a triple.’”

Sheen used another “old phrase” to describe Romney’s performance in the second presidential debate.

 “Mr. Romney really showed his ass there, and how stupid he is and arrogant,” the actor said. “There’s an old phrase, arrogance is ignorance matured, and that’s what we saw.”

As for the final debate, Sheen thought Obama handily won but “gave Romney too much time and didn’t shut him up when he could have easily done so.”
