A group of Floridians line up at an early voting station. (CBS Miami)A Florida bomb squad has detonated two suspicious packages that were discovered outside one of the state's early voting stations on Saturday morning.

Voting was suspended until 2 p.m. on the final day of early voting, with a long line of reportedly upset voters waiting to cast their ballots. Early voting has been popular in Florida, with an estimated 3.9 million votes already cast before next week's official Election Day.

The Orange County Bomb Squad said the main object in question was a cooler with a USB cord sticking out from its side. It was spotted by a voter outside the Winter Park Library at around 11:30 a.m. on Saturday.

A "suspicious garbage bag" discovered at the site was also detonated by authorities, according to local NBC affiliate WESH.com.

The AP says officials evacuated the library after the cooler and garbage bag were discovered. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson has asked Gov. Rick Scott to issue an emergency order extending early voting hours through Sunday. But Scott has rejected similar requests and has not yet responded to Nelson's request.

In his letter to Gov. Scott, Sen. Nelson writes, "You should be doing everything in your power to make sure everybody has the chance to vote, and that their vote is counted. Instead, Gov. Scott, you are allowing people to be turned away and jeopardizing the credibility of Florida's election."
