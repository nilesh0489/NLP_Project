I do not intend to patronise but you cannot allow these reports to lull you into a false sense of security and a belief that he will win regardless of your vote. If everyone thought that way, it would be a disaster. USE YOUR VOTES, for the good of the world.

EDIT: I am not an American, just an interested onlooker. Whilst I am a supporter of the Democratic party I did not in any way intend to dictate the direction of anyone's vote. PLEASE USE YOUR VOTES; WHOEVER YOU CAST THEM FOR.
