As more details emerge from the Romneys’ “backstage” experience on election night as it became apparent that Obama was the winner (Romney quietly stunned, Ryan flabbergasted, their wives crying), I’m discovering a greater and greater sense of glee by the minute. It’s petty, it’s negative, but I can’t deny that it’s how I feel, and strongly at that.

These smug, born-rich fucks have the nerve to call 47% of us entitled moochers and take aim at programs that help us, when they themselves are the DEFINITION of entitled. The Romneys get (and greedily hoard) everything they want in any quantity they desire on demand, and they always have. It’s all they know. And now, with this election, we have something they really, REALLY wanted BAD, and guess what? They can’t fucking have it. All I can say is: Welcome to our world, motherfuckers. This, of course, is just a taste, and they’ll never REALLY know what reality’s like, but it is SO SWEET to hear about these arrogant pricks just fucking gobsmacked and broken and crying about not being able to get what they want. They wanted something that they couldn’t buy and they don’t know how to deal.

And the best part of all is that it’s sounding like they didn’t know it was coming. We already knew that their base had no idea; the conservative-media-bubble did its usual fine job of keeping them brainwashed and misinformed. However, it’s looking more and more like Mitt and Ann and Paul were also taken in. They embraced whatever alternative polls and sources that Fox and their ilk were pushing, they bought fireworks and brimmed with confidence, and were left stunned by the election’s outcome. The fact that the willful, practiced ignorance that made the prospect of their administration so dangerous to us allowed them not just to be defeated, but to actually be AMBUSHED by it really is the icing on the cake.

Whatever else comes of Obama’s continued presidency, this has been a good week.
