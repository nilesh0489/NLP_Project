The debate begins at 9PM Eastern Time; coverage will begin before that time.

The Al Jazeera and /r/Politics partnership threads we did for the other Presidential Debates went so well, that Al Jazeera is back for more of your commentary on the third-party debate tonight, hosted by Larry King!

In short, they would like to know what you expect to happen, what you hope happens, and then your comments and reactions to what actually happened in the debate. Some of your comments here may be used during their on-air broadcast, which you can find live-streaming here.

Our host tonight is Malika Bilal (username /u/Mmbilal), Digital Producer and host of the program segments that will relate to reddit and other social media. The Stream's guest tonight is John Stanton (@dcbigjohn) of BuzzFeed.

The debate has no official structure or designated topics. However, you can submit questions to the candidates via Twitter by using the hashtag #AskEmThisLarry.
