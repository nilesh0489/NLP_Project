A few days ago, we published this article about a claim that Planned Parenthood performs an abortion every 96 seconds. We alleged that the claim was false. We were wrong and we were called out on it, and for that, we are grateful because it allowed us to place the statistic in perspective.

Planned Parenthood does perform an abortion about every 96 seconds (based on a 24 hour/365 day calendar), which sounds horrific, until you realize that across the country, a woman receives an abortion every 26 seconds (also based on 24/365). Note that that statistic comes directly from an anti-choice site, but verified through the Guttmacher Institute. The Center for Disease Control places that number at closer to every 38 seconds. Either way, Planned Parenthood is doing their job – they are preventing abortions.
