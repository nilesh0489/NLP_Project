Say what you will about Donald Trump, the man sure has friends in high places.

Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren has come to the defense of the real estate mogul, after an online petition to get the department store to “dump Trump” as its celebrity spokesman garnered more than 500,000 signatures, Buzzfeed reports.

“Please understand and appreciate that Macy's marketing and merchandising offerings are not representative of any political position,” Lundgren wrote to Angelo Carusone, the man behind the petition, in a letter. “Ours is a free society compromised [sic] of a wide range of viewpoints.”

Trump recently has made sure to share those “viewpoints," especially with regards to President Barack Obama, saying in the days before the election that he would donate $5 million to charity if the president's passport and college records were released. Then, on the night of the election, Trump decided it would be a good idea to tweet this:

Carusone, for his part, isn’t backing down, replying to Lundgren’s letter by threatening to release a letter in which the CEO outlines a plan to further develop Macy’s Trump partnership.
