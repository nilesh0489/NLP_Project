So, remember how Ted Nugent, that charming young bard of the rock-n-roll genre,said this thingback in April?

“If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.”

We aren’t really sure if it’s appropriate to start the Nugent Death / Jail Watch with the reelection of Barack Obama, or if we have to actually wait until April 2013 so he has the full year. As of right now, Mr. Nugent’s commentsare still on his Twitter feed, though we would not be surprised if he Trumpsthem at some point in the near future.
