Hello there, wonderful users of /r/Politics!

As I am sure you know, today is the Presidential Election in the United States between President Barack Obama (Democrat) and Governor Mitt Romney (Republican). Others running for President are Gary Johnson (Libertarian), Jill Stein (Green), Virgil Goode (Constitution), and Rocky Anderson (Justice).

Please make sure you vote today. Your vote only counts if you cast it.

Also, the kind folks at Al Jazeera English, such as Malika Bilal and Rami, would once again like to hear your thoughts. In short, they would like to know what you expect to happen, what you hope happens, and then reactions to what actually happened in the Presidential election. As before, some of your comments here may be used during their on-air broadcast.

You should be able to watch their coverage from Al Jazeera online.

We are going to be moderating this thread heavily. If you see something that you feel should be brought to mod attention quickly, then please report it / message the mods ASAP.

And, even though this should go without saying, please observe the Reddiquette. Please vote based on comments that contribute to the discussion as a whole. We would like all sides of the political spectrum to be properly represented here. In short, please don't use the voting arrows as synonymous for agreement or disagreement with the point being made.

Edit: Eric with CNN dropped by here.

Edit2: /u/Redtaboo asked me to provide a link to the Reddit IRC election channel here. If you have an IRC client, point it at irc.snoonet.com #election2012, and if not.... you can use the web client.

(Please up vote this thread as we gain no karma from it, and the discussion and interaction should be good for everyone involved.)
