Campaigning for President Barack Obama in Philadelphia on Monday afternoon, former President Bill Clinton struck a note of irony while attempting to criticize Mitt Romney’s campaign.

“You’re laughing, but who wants a president who will knowingly, repeatedly tell you something he knows is not true?” Clinton asked, after discounting a claim in a recent Romney ad that the Obama administration’s auto bailout hurt American workers.

“When I was a kid, if I got my hand caught in the cookie jar, where it wasn’t supposed to be, I turned red in my face, and I took my hand out of the cookie jar,” Clinton added.

Clinton was impeached in 1998 on one count of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice, after repeatedly telling Americans and a grand jury that he did not have sexual relations with a White House intern.

“You’ve got to give it to Governor Romney. When he gets his hand caught in the cookie jar, he just digs down for more cookies,” Clinton said Monday, to applause. “I want you to send him a message tomorrow. You don’t have to be from Ohio to want your president to tell you the truth, when it comes to jobs for the American people.”
