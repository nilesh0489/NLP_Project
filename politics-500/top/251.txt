After thanking everyone from the politicians, to first responders in what he dubbed "A Daily Show Tribute to Institutional Competence" for the response to Hurricane Sandy which as we all know, just ravaged the east coast, Jon Stewart had a bit of fun with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his change of heart towards his new best friend, President Barack Obama.

After showing a clip of Christie from twelve days ago showing the governor saying President Obama was fumbling around in the dark "clutching for the light switch of leadership," followed by Christie thanking the President over and over for his great leadership after the hurricane hit, Stewart quipped, "Yeah, I guess he found that f**king light switch, huh?"

As Stewart noted, Christie had time to "climb down from Bulls**t Mountain and deal with this Obama (the real Obama) not this Obama (Clint Eastwood talking to a chair). Not everybody got the memo.

Cue the knuckleheads over at Fox & Friends asking Christie when he's going to bring in Romney for a photo op which we covered here.
