Vice President Joe Biden gave a campaign speech in Ohio on Wednesday, refusing to let a crying baby distract from his message that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is no good for the United States.

"I don't blame that baby for crying," he said, over audible wails from a child in the crowd. "You know what, she just realized what it means if Romney gets elected. She is out there -- God love her. Hi, baby, how are you? It's okay, he's not gonna get elected, you're going to be okay. You're gonna be okay. But you can't blame her. God, I shouldn't be scaring children like this."

Clever, but not original. Biden has wrapped tearful interruptions into his speeches on multiple occasions, suggesting that babies are sobbing because they oppose Romney's policies.
