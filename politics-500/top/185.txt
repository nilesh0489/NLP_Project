Greg Gutfeld of Fox News interviewed Conservative economist Ben Stein yesterday, and when the host didn’t get the answer he wanted, he deemed Stein as a “Communist.”

Congress right now can pass a law which would prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of anyone’s income, but Republicans are obstructing anything that doesn’t protect the wealthiest, so it’s rather telling when one of their own asks a Fox News host, why he would care if taxes went up on the rich. Gutfeld responds that he lives in a basement apartment, obviously inferring that tax cuts for the wealthy would not effect him, but after a two second Google search, it appears that the Fox host is worth $2 million net. That must be one sweet basement flat!

The hosts on Fox News, all millionaires, are the ones perpetuating the myth that tax cuts for higher earners will somehow magically help the economy.
