On Monday, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared on CNN’s Starting Point once again, where host Soledad O’Brien asked him about his previous comment that the White House’s reaction and explanation to the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi constituted a “cover up.”

The anchor had highlighted a comment by Matthew Dowd — formerly the chief strategist for the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential campaign — noting the time it has taken in trying to determine whether there had been weapons of mass destruction, and adding that it could take a long time as well to determine what, exactly, occurred in Libya.

“So we’re going to blame this on Bush, too?” Giuliani asked.

The discussion between the two grew heated, then, as O’Brien told her guest the following:

You’ve got to stop putting words in my mouth sir. Seriously, hang on, let me finish. Because every time I ask you a question… and let me finish my point. Every time I ask you a question, you like to push back as if somehow the question that’s being posed to you is unfair. It’s not. I’m a journalist. You said some things. I’m trying to get some accurate responses from you. You are welcome to answer. Go ahead.

Last time he appeared on the show, you’ll recall, Giuliani had accused O’Brien of displaying bias in her questions to him, jokingly asking if he was debating the President’s campaign.
