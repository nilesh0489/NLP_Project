It makes me wonder if those on the right who have been so highly skeptical of polls and aggregate polling data will admit the errors of their ways should Obama win a second term.

I'm willing to wager they won't.

BONUS EXTRA EDIT: Sweet merciful crap, vote! Obama supporters, don't let things like this lull you into a false sense of security, the fat lady has not yet sung! Romney supporters, get out there and let your voice be heard! Those of you who support candidates like Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, keep fighting the good fight!
