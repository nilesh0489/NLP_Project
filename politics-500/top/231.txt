Oh the irony again.  GOP caught red-handed committing election fraud.  True (no pun) the story is unfolding.

Here's True The Vote's homepage.  Where you will find their hotline phone number:  855-444-6100.  A bit devilish to mention, BUT CALL TRUE THE VOTE AND COMPLAIN if you are hassled by one of their "poll watchers"

Take names, pictures, etc.  If enough of these enemies of democracy are prosecuted, perhaps this type of intimidation will end.  Dare we dream?

You can read the story from Plunderbund.com here:

True The Vote Forged Signatures To Get Observers At Ohio Polls

The FCBOE met today and determined that True the Vote had likely falsified the forms submitted for general election observers.    The new observer forms, filed over the past few days by True the Vote representative (and Hilliard Tea Party Member) Jan Loar, used candidate signatures copied from a previous set of forms filed in early October All but one of the six candidates whose names appeared on the original form had withdrawn permission to use their signatures prior to the submission of today’s forms.   During the BOE meeting Candidate Terri Jamison spoke up to say her name was “forged” on the latest round of forms. True the Vote observers will not be allowed in Franklin County polling locations tomorrow.

Hooray!  True the vote.  GOP is using Orwell as a mentor.

Classic Teahadist, Hatriot, GOP behavior.  And why are women doing these things?  To be popular?

And this is rich:

TRUE THE VOTE AND JUDICIAL WATCH SUE OHIO ELECTION OFFICIALS TO FORCE CLEAN UP OF VOTING ROLLS

Ah, that's what's behind the voter purging this year, perhaps.
