UPS has confirmed that it has implemented a new policy for its charitable giving that will disqualify groups like the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The UPS Foundation posted the following on its site yesterday:

The UPS Foundation seeks to support organizations that are in alignment with our focus areas, guidelines, and non-discrimination policy. UPS and The UPS Foundation do not discriminate against any person or organization with regard to categories protected by applicable law, as well as other categories protected by UPS and The UPS Foundation in our own policies. These include, but are not limited to race, gender, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or military status, pregnancy, age and religion.

In September, The American Independent reported on companies like UPS and Intel that had made donations to the Boy Scouts. In 2010, UPS gave $167,000 to BSA and clarified at that time that it would not be changing its policies. At that time, Intel clarified to ThinkProgress that it had already implemented a new safeguard to prevent the company’s charitable giving from supporting discriminating organizations or charities. Intrepid activist Zach Wahls then led a petition effort against UPS, which has apparently followed suit.

Daily Kos is running a campaign to thank the UPS Foundation for standing by its principled support of LGBT equality and ending its donations to the Boy Scouts.
