You’ve all heard it, that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are liars. Well, no need to take our word on it, we now have a study that proves exactly what we’ve said all along.

PolitiFact – a ‘non partisan’ organisation that many considers lean slightly to the right – did the study comparing the claims of the Republican Presidential ticket of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to those of the Democratic Presidential ticket, Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

For statements that were ruled to be “True” and “Mostly True”, it’s Obama and Biden at 45.0%, Romney and Ryan at 29.1%. When it comes to “False”, “Mostly False” and “Pants on Fire”, it’s Romney and Ryan at 43.9% and Obama and Biden at 28.8%. In fact, Romney and Ryan have over 4 times as many “Pants of Fire” lies as the President and Vice President. Mitt Romney himself has well over half of the total amount of “Pants of Fire” lies (58.6%) of all the candidates combined!
