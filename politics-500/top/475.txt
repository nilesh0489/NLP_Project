Here is a rundown of all of the national polls on Monday, just 24 hours before the election. most of the polls that are regularly reported on CNN and Fox news ABC news etc. were wrong. Every single one of those polls was biased against Obama and towards Romney.

Notice the average of all of the polls is +1.6 in favor of Obama

I don't have a conspiracy theory here. I'm not accusing anybody of anything. I'm simply pointing out that nearly every major national poll was wrong, and wrong in a way that favored Mitt Romney. I don't know how that happened but it did happen

CNN just reported he will almost certainly win the popular vote by more than 3%.

Here's more on that

In the future I'm going to pay more attention to the Washington Post/ABC polls because that one seems to have been the most accurate. the Rasmussen polls ± Error rate is reported as either 3% or 4% depending. Interestingly enough they were wrong by EXACTLY 4%. But I'm sure that's just a big coincidence

Here is another look which clearly shows the overwhelming majority of Polls were heavily skewed in favor of Mr. Romney (thanks to jk 13)
