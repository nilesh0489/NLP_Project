One, was an attack in another country...with what appears to be no direct involvement by the president....and the other was an attack on U.S. soil, where Bush was warned ahead of time that it would happen.

Seriously this is nuts. Yeah...the president conspired, to have one of his ambassadors killed. A man he appointed, a man he knew personally. Let me guess, Stevens was going to come out that him and Obama were gay lovers...and that's why he had to go.

I'd like to say that politicizing of these deaths is the lowest the republicans have fallen...but this is the same party that started the birther movement.
