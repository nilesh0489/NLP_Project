There were around a thousand other people in line mostly older people. Now, it's early voting and there's still lots of time; however the youth vote in this country is dismal. It really does matter in any state. Get out and vote!

What I am saying is that you should VOTE, especially "young" people who don't usually turn out. The narrative is that we don't vote. Over-performing would make people take notice. Moreover, it is important and it does change things. Thanks for being awesome /r/Politics!
