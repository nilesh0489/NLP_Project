The House of Representatives went big for the GOP in 2010. In 2012, the tide is rolling back, but turnout matters. If Democrats are going to take back the House by 2014, it is going to take a massive turnout in 2012 of voters who are sick of the obstructionist, small-minded House of Representatives.

Intrade suggests the chances of Democrats taking back the House in 2012 are only 5%, and Nate Silver hasn't even brought it up since June (when he declined to make a prediction). But RealClearPolitics shows 26 toss-ups which could bring the House closer to being evenly divided. The Princeton Election Consortium even predicted last month that the Democrats had a very good chance of taking back the House this year—though polling data has chanced since then, it still hints at a better-than-5% chance.

Whether or not the House will change hands in 10 days, we shouldn't sit on our asses like we did in 2010.

Setting our sights on 2014, a huge turnout this year, bringing Dems within easy reach of the majority, is essential, and possible. Obama has a good chance of winning this year, the Senate race, while close, is likely to keep Dems in the majority, and the public is pissed at Congress, which means people are open to the possibility that the Republican members of the House are at fault.

Those 26 seats could all go blue.
