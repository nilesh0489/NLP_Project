Please review the guidelines below as they may help us identify your voting location:

Make sure to include your street number. E.g., enter “555 Elm Street” instead of “Elm Street”

Do not include your city or state in the “street address” field. E.g., enter “402 North Ave” instead of “402 North Ave, Akron, OH”

Include “Street,” “Road,” “Ave,” etc. in your address. E.g., enter “47 Maple Street” instead of “47 Maple”

Enter a street address instead of the name of a place. E.g., enter “100 West College Street” instead of “State University”

Make sure you submit the address where you are registered to vote, unless you’re in a state with same day voter registration.
