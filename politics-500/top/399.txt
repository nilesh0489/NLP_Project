After last week’s election losses, the Republican party has begun to wonder what went wrong and, more importantly, what changes they can make to avoid a similar fate in the next election.  It is a rare moment of introspection for the GOP.  Should we rethink our draconian stance on immigration in order to court the Latino vote?  Perhaps we should stop talking about rape as anything other than a totally horrific crime against innocent victims? Think, Republicans, think!!  How do we win back voters?

And then someone finally figured it out.  Book it, done. We’re calling the 2016 election right now for the GOP.

Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) has realized what has been missing from the GOP party all these years: not enough gerrymandering.

Husted, who already came under fire this election cycle for his partisan governance of provisional ballots, now proposes that Ohio divide up its electoral votes by Congressional district.  You know, to be more fair.

Which doesn’t sound that bad on its face, until you realize that under Husted’s plan, 12 of Ohio’s 18 electoral votes would have gone to Mitt Romney, even though Barack Obama won the popular vote there 50.2% to 48.2%. The reason for this is Ohio’ssevere gerrymandering of Congressional districts:

Ohio’s incredibly gerrymandered Congressional districts have been drawn to pack Democrats together so they have the majority in only 4 of the state’s 16 congressional districts. In addition to winning those four — assuming Husted would have us adopt the electoral vote allocation used by Maine and Nebraska, the only states to split their EVs by Congressional district — Obama would have also gotten the two at-large electoral votes bringing the final tally to 6 for Obama and 12 for Romney.
