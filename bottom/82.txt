The number of apps available for Android now totals about 700,000, a Google spokesman confirmed to CNET. That's up from the 675,000the company said it had a month ago.

And it equals the figure Apple most recently touted. The Cupertino, Calif., company first revealed it had about 700,000 apps available in its store last month, and Apple reiterated that amount during the iPad Mini launch last week.
