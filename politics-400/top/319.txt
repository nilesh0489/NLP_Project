Americans overwhelmingly support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, according to a poll released Wednesday.

Fifty-seven percent of Americans favor creating a path to citizenship, with 39 percent opposed, the ABC/Washington Post survey found. Eighty-two percent of Hispanics support a path to citizenship, compared with 51 percent of whites. Seven in 10 Americans between 18 and 29 support a path.

The slimmest of majorities, 51 percent, supports gay marriage, according to the poll. Forty-seven percent are opposed. Among younger adults, support jumps to 66 percent. Independent voters also back marriage more than the electorate as a whole, 54 percent to 43 percent. In last Tuesday’s election, voters in four states weighed in in favor of gay marriage, legalizing it in Maryland, Maine and Washington state. Minnesota defeated a constitutional amendment that would have banned it.

Half of all Americans oppose legalizing marijuana, and 48 percent support it. Some of the strongest opposition comes from Hispanic voters: only 34 percent would legalize the drug. Fifty-five percent of younger voters support legalization. Two states — Colorado and Washington — eliminated all civil and criminal penalties for recreational marijuana use.
