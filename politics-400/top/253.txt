Four torture survivors have filed a complaintwith the U.N. Committee Against Torture against Canada for its failure to prosecute George Bush during his visit to British Columbia last year, the first such grievance filed against a high-level U.S. official. The Canadian Centre for International Justice (CCIJ) and the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) cited Canada's international obligations as a signatory to the Convention against Torture. Last year, Canada's Attorney General refused to launch a criminalinvestigation despite a 69-page draft indictment and 4,000 pages of evidence against Bush submitted by the four men - Hassan bin Attash, Sami el-Hajj, Muhammed Khan Tumani and Murat Kurnaz. Lawyers called Canadaâ€™s refusal "a low point in the ongoing struggle to end impunity for torturers."
