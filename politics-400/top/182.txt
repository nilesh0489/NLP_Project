Now that the election is over, can we all agree that Gary Johnson is a scam? After raising $1 million on his website for the specific purpose of TV ads and after raising $2.3 million total, he ended up spending only $13,600 on ads, or 0.6% of his entire campaign budget, while somehow racking up $227,202 in debts.

And by the time he finally did start running ads, it was for his "Be the 5%" campaign, for the sole purpose of giving Gary Johnson $90 million in tax payer funding. In other words, Gary lied about how he was going to spend money on ads. And the ads he did run were for the sole purpose of getting more money, not for the sake of any sort of social change.

So where did the money go? Of the $2.3 million that Gary Johnson raised, $2 million was spent on a single organization, NSON Opinion Strategies, who served as Gary Johnson's "advisors." If you want to know about NSON, visit this link: http://nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/gary-johnson-swindle

"But that's only because Gary Johnson didn't raise much money to begin with! He can't compete with Obama or Romney!"

Check the first link. Jill Stein, Thad McCotter, Buddy Roemer, Fred Karger, and Randall Terry all raised far less money than Johnson did, yet they all managed to spend far more on media. Terry raised only $270, but he spent $80k on ads (27.5%). Stein raised $893k, but she spent $260k on ads (27.5%).

"But he needed that money to get on the ballot and fight legal challenges!"

Completely false. Check out Johnson's expenditure report. Only $17,500 went to law firms, or less than 1% of the total campaign budget.

"This is only a minor scandal, because the things he stands for are so much more important!"

Right, because you can absolutely trust a man who willfully lies about his own campaign expenditures to deliver his promises on everything else. This isn't simply an issue of mismanagement, it's an issue of credibility. Gary Johnson doesn't have any.
