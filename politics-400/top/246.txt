Total lie. They are laying off 50 people, not 200, and have been slowly closing their operations down since Sept. 11, 2011. So they announced the company will be closed by 2015 in 2011: http://annistonstar.com/view/full_story/20755025/article-More-layoffs-announced-at-Anniston-weapons-incinerator?instance=1st_left

These layoffs were announced in June of 2012. Not because of the economy but because they create a product that has lost demand since other competitors have sold more goods: http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/11/08/research-in-motion-cuts-jobs-at-irving-headquarters/

These aren't layoffs...they are permanent in an effort to downsize a company that has been losing money for a long time. http://www.wkyt.com/wymt/home/headlines/Company-lays-off-workers-in-Pikeville-177766221.html

This is a newspaper that has seen its circulation decline from 90,085 to 83,733 in a year's time. They have been regularly laying off employees like every other newspaper across the country as less Americans get their news from newspapers and choose to get it free from the Internet and television: http://www2.turnto10.com/business/2012/nov/08/providence-journal-announces-more-layoffs-ar-1233784/

This company declared bankruptcy last year and sold to a chinese company in July of 2011. This recent round of layoffs was 170 people and their business has been in decline since 2008. They make luxury private jets for rich people and I'm assuming the rich can only own a certain amount of private luxury jets at one time: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120802/us-hawker-beechcraft-layoffs/

Boeing expanded it's business dramatically during the Iraq war with HUGE contracts with the defense department. As the war came to a close, they saw their business decline. I guess if you want constant war, Boeing would always be making billions from the government but this is their official statement: "Boeing said the changes were not a response to the threat of additional, across-the-board U.S. budget cuts due to take effect on January 2, or the outcome of U.S. elections, but represented another step in its continuing drive to "be more competitive while investing in technologies and people." So the company itself is deying it has anything to do with the presidential elections and that they layoffs were planned and expected: http://www.catholic.org/business/story.php?id=48428

This hospital received $3.2 million dollars in federal grant money to keep their doors open but their expenses exceeded their revenues by more than $400,000. They simply don't know how to run a business apparently. http://www.catholic.org/business/story.php?id=48428

This was the result of a sale of a company to a competitor. Sprint (cell phone company) purchased US Cellular to eliminate a competitor in a certain market. This was a planned sale that took place over the past month, it just happened to be announced on Wednesday. It takes longer than one day to sell a mult-million dollar company: http://www.wirelessweek.com/News/2012/11/carriers-Sprint-Buys-US-Cellular-Midwest-Markets-for-480M/

This is the funniest one so far. This is a bank from Germany and Poland that has absolutely no connection to the U.S. or Obama In looking for official layoff reports, I found this statement from the bank from Nov. 8 where they announced they are investing $2 BILLION euros in their company. Sounds like growth to me. https://www.commerzbank.com/en/hauptnavigation/presse/pressemitteilungen/archiv1/2012/quartal_12_04/presse_archiv_detail_12_04_9794.html

This is the second funniest because it's an airline out of SPAIN that has no connections (or jobs) to the U.S. Spain's economy has been sinking harder that the U.S. since 2007. Absolutely no connection to America or Obama: http://www.theworld.org/2012/11/spains-iberia-airlines-announces-layoffs/

This is a TEMPORARY LAYOFF. All of these jobs will be reinstated in two weeks, as reported by the owner of the company here: http://www.tylerstarnews.com/page/content.detail/id/508789/Momentive-Inc--plans-temporary-layoffs-for-150.html?nav=5008

These layoffs were disclosed on Oct. 29. I'm afraid that was a full week BEFORE Obama's re-election. Absolutely no connection here: http://www.tylerstarnews.com/page/content.detail/id/508789/Momentive-Inc--plans-temporary-layoffs-for-150.html?nav=5008

I'm not even looking this up. If people are stupid and desperate enough to blame Obama for the layoff of 20 people in Berlin, Germany, they are idiots. But then again, I wonder if they even realize that Berlin is in Germany and not in America. Probably not.

Huge lie. First sentence in this story reports the layoffs to be 200 and not 1,700. Blatant lie there. It should be noted that this is a company from Denmark and not an American company. EDIT: I stand corrected on this as I found a quote from the article: The combined layoffs, plus some attrition and relocations, have reduced Vestas' Colorado workforce from 1,700 to 1,200 this year. So we can assume the total number of employees is 1,700 (the amount the email suggests was laid off) and that the numbers laid off amount to 500. http://www.denverpost.com/recommended/ci_21754574

This is a company based in Sweden, again absolutely no connection to Obama or the U.S. In fact, the majority of those affected are in Sweden or where their products are made in Poland: http://www.appliancemagazine.com/news.php?article=1626614&zone=0&first=1

This is another funny one. Ericsson is a Swedish company (like Husqvarna) and those layoffs are in Sweden. They are not 14,000, they are 1,550. Pretty big difference: http://www.i4u.com/2012/11/sony-ericsson/ericsson-swedens-job-announces-cuts

Another blatant lie. These layoffs were planned, (like another one) on October 29, 2012. A full week before Obama was re-elected. Here is all the info to prove that: http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/11/06/sra-international-to-lay-off-222-in.html

This company is moving operations overseas to save money on having to pay Americans a livable wage. The governor of MA tried to talk them into keeping the jobs in America but the company refused to discuss it with them before making the decision to outsource their jobs: http://articles.courant.com/2012-01-18/business/hc-perkinelmer-layoffs-20120118_1_transfer-jobs-perkinelmer-global-stage

THIS is a company trying to destroy their union. Their workers are in a union and their contract ran out Oct. 31st. The company has made more money this year than they did last year but they are still cutting jobs despite making more money. A quote from the union representative: “These out-of-state owners who control billions are coming to Indiana and taking away our jobs,” said Coleman. It is also worth mentioning that these layoffs were announced on Nov. 6th before the election was officially over and anyone knew who won.

TOTAL LIE: This company is renovating its current location and these layoffs will occur NEXT YEAR and they will be TEMPORARY according to the person in charge: http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121106/CITYANDREGION/121109477/1002

Numbers are wrong. It's 470 and everyone agrees that this is the direct result of mismanagement under CEO Lamberto Andreotti...quote from the story: "nominee for worst chief executive of the year." http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/bristol-myers-slash-480-sales-related-jobs-nj/2012-11-06

This is one of the biggest lies: THIRTY people were laid off. 30. Not 500. And the layoffs occurred on NOV.5, THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. People who believe this stuff are idiots. Ironically, the CEO mentions in this article that they have 750 people on the payroll. Eliminating 500 of those seems kind of out of the question.

I couldn't find a single news article to back this up with any kind of facts at all. Enough said.

Again, there is absolutely not a single news story to back this claim up anywhere. If it happened, there would be a press release. Right wing blogs are announcing this with NO reference or citation.

This is a Canadian company and these layoffs were announced NOV. 5th, a DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2012/11/05/nb-atlantic-lotto-layoffs.html

These layoffs were announce on September 10th, almost two full months before Obama was re-elected. These are going to take place over THE NEXT THREE YEARS in a restructuring effort: http://www.qmed.com/news/welch-allyn-initiates-global-restructuring-including-layoffs

This is a total lie as well. The company released a financial report on Oct. 29th, 2012 and only said they were considering layoffs with NO specific numbers mentioned. The only place I can find this is on rightwing blogs, again, with no citations or references to any specifics. The company's report on Oct. 29th announced NO layoffs. http://thurbersthoughts.blogspot.com/2012/10/dana-considering-layoffs-as-obamacare.html

These were announced on June 25, 2012 and it's in response to trying to compensate for a new 2.3% tax on medical devices as part of the new health care act. I don't have to tell you how little 2.3% is and there is also no indiction that it would be 5% of it's employee force. The latest news says 'more than 100' positions would be laid off. http://www.massdevice.com/news/stryker-begin-new-york-layoffs-ahead-medical-device-tax-wall-street-beat

These were announced in AUGUST and were a direct result of a change in management and a new CEO. http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/us-bostonscientific-layoffs-idUSBRE87S0Z120120829

ANNOUNCED SEPTEMBER 6TH, 2012 as a result of the company restructuring plan. http://www.massdevice.com/news/layoffs-medtronic-cut-another-500-jobs-hopes-saving-125m-year

This company is based in LONDON and these job cuts in Memphis were announced in September. This is the only real story I could find about it: http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/ArticleEmail.aspx?id=64753

Announced on October 17th, about TWO SOLID WEEKS before Obama was re-elected. The facts hurt, I guess: Half of these workers being laid off are in EUROPE. Even though they are laying these people off, the overall amount of workers at Abbott Labs has grown due to additional acquisitions of other companies. Full story here: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbott-labs-cuts-550-jobs-more-layoffs-planned-2012-10-17

This is funny. The company denies any reports of layoffs in May of this year, no real news of layoffs since then: http://www.thesunchronicle.com/mansfield/covidien-denies-layoffs-report/article_a55f54db-b925-5b86-b246-136f2178e487.html?mode=story

This was announced on JULY 13th, 2012 as part of restructuring after a $6.3 billion dollar buyout in 2011. http://www.massdevice.com/news/report-kinetic-concepts-lays-300-more

This was announced NOV. 2, FOUR DAYS before Obama was re-elected. I wonder if Romney would have won if these lunatics would be blaming Romney for the job losses that occurred 4 days before anyone knew who was going to be the next president: It should also be noted that the company blames poor sales of defibrillators and pacemakers, not on the economy. http://www.startribune.com/business/176871351.html?refer=y

This is ANOTHER company where the right wing blogs continue to report a layoff in these numbers (200) where there is absolutely no real news source or citation for this. Repeating something over and over doesn't make it true. Just look at Fox: They said Romney would be elected for the past month 1,000 times. Didn't make it so. I would put a source but since there is no source for this, I will leave it alone

This is the company that owns Red Lobster and the Olive Garden. All they are doing is cutting back hours so they aren't forced to cover employees' medical insurance. Typical big business: Just like Walmart: Wring your workers out for all you can get, work them JUST under the amount of hours where they would be provided some kind of health care security. Just a shitty company more than anything else but no reflection of the election at all but more of an attack on the new healthcare law.

Utter lies. Jancoa is a janitorial outfit in Cincinnati, OH whose owner testified against the new health care law in congress. Funny that this reports she is laying off 350 workers when the owner herself REPORTS THAT THE ENTIRE COMPANY EMPLOYS 320 PEOPLE. Absolutely no layoffs reported anywhere from this company as of Nov. 9, 2012. Maybe it's republicans' wishful thinking? http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2012/07/11/jancoa-ceo-mary-miller-testified-on.html
