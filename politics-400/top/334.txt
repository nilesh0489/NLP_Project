At least one conservative Fox News commentator isn't blaming Mitt Romney's loss on Hurricane Sandy.

On Thursday, tea party-backed radio host Michael Graham told Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that President Barack Obama scared voters by claiming that women would be "forced into rape camps" under the Republican presidential nominee.

Graham explained that Obama was not elected with a mandate because "he didn't run on an affirmative campaign."

"He ran on the Republicans are Satan incarnate and if women vote for them, they're going to be forced into rape camps," the radio host insisted. "And when that's your campaign, you can't be surprised when the people you ran against don't want to work with you and you don't have an issue to rally people around."
