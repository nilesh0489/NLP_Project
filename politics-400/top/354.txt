Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.) is narrowly leading his Republican opponent, Martha McSally, in a race that has yet to be called nearly a week after Election Day.

Barber is 289 votes ahead of McSally, who was leading in the count last week, according to local reports. That tally is as of Saturday, the last counting day of the week.

At least two counties still have thousands of ballots to count, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

Barber currently holds the seat, after winning a special election to replace former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) earlier this year. 

Giffords, who campaigned for Barber, her former aide, is still recovering after being shot in the head in January 2011.
