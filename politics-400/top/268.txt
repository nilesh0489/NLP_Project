They first tried to hope that the US failed from 08 to 2012 by the policies that were being made. Now that it is clear that the policies put forth by Obama are working, it seems that the GOP and 'top 1%' are actually taking action by firing people that will set the unemployment up unnecessarily in a desperate attempt to try to prove Obama's policies are not working. Just like a little spoiled brat breaking things until they get what they want. Give me what i want or ill scream and start breaking things!
