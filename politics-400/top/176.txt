Gov. Rick Perry, who famously mused about secession in 2009, doesn’t support an effort by some Texas residents who are petitioning to leave the United States.

“Gov. Perry believes in the greatness of our Union and nothing should be done to change it,” Perry spokesman Catherine Frazier told the Dallas Morning News. “But he also shares the frustrations many Americans have with our federal government.”

A petition on the White House website We The People asking for permission for Texas to leave the union has received 60,402 signatures, more than the 25,000 necessary to trigger a response from the White House. Other states have also created petitions asking to secede, but only Texas has hit the 25,000 mark.
