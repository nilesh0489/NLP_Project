On his show Tuesday night, The Daily Show host Jon Stewart slammed businessmen who laid off employees after President Barack Obama was re-elected, claiming that these “job creators” were merely using Obamacare to “wriggle out of the social contract.”

The late-night comedian told companies like Papa John’s to stop pretending the election had transformed them into “reluctant assholes,” noting that businesses had a long history of shafting their workers.

Stewart noted that if Obama had pushed for a single-payer health care system, companies would no longer have to pay for health care premiums.

He advised the companies that had laid off employees or cut hours to “take all the millions you donated for partisan political purposes and pump it back into the type of health care advances that may ultimately increase business productivity.”

“And then, finally, we can just keep pizza out of politics, because at a certain point it is going to make children’s parties very uncomfortable.”
