Look, Citizens United was a disaster. The question is, what are we going to do about it? How are we going to stuff this "corporations are people, elections are auctions, democracy is for sale" mess into the Dumpster of Bad Ideas?

Here's how: A constitutional amendment that puts power back in the hands of the people. The actual, human people.

Sign below to join me in calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.

We, the undersigned, have had it. Corporations are not people. Elections should not be auctions. And we refuse to let our democracy be put up for sale. We are standing together to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. Al Franken & <YOUR NAME HERE>
