Another downside to losing an election: Say goodbye to your Facebook friends.

At least, that’s the case for Mitt Romney, who has lost an average of 847 Facebook friends per hour, Mashable reports.

Three days after he conceded, Romney had already lost 50,000 “likes” on Facebook, though he was still gaining fans up until Tuesday.

“Soon after Romney conceded the election, though, his social media followers began dropping quickly. Since 11:30 on Tuesday, more than 55,025 users have unliked the Massachusetts Governor, at a rate of about 847 an hour. Romney’s actually gained 17,601 Twitter followers since he lost the election. That’s odd, and might be more evidence of bot activity more than human interest, considering he hasn’t tweeted since 5:55 on Election Day—a final relic of a message reads ‘With your help, we will turn our country around and get America back on the path to prosperity. Please vote today.’”
