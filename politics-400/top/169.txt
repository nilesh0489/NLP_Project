White House petition calls for anyone in favor of secession to be deported. The Petition called “Strip the Citizenship from Everyone who Signed a Petition to Secede and Exile Them” has received over 5,135 signatures already, leaving them with just 19,865 more to get to their 25,000 signature goal. Once they reach 25,000 signatures it is stated that the White House must make a formal response to a petition.

The Petition says “Mr. President, please sign an executive order such that each American citizen who signed a petition from any state to secede from the USA shall have their citizenship stripped and be peacefully deported.”

All of this is in response to the recent slew of petitions coming from individuals hoping to get signatures allowing their states to secede from the United States. The state of Texas now has 86,000 signatures in its request to secede from the United States.

The petition war is an indicator that people in America are getting uneasy and that their may be potential civil unrest brewing following these elections. If things in America get worse before they get better, issues like this could become more relevant and escalate to levels of civil unrest.

What do you think will happen if President Obama, and Congress are unable to right the ship and get America out of the economic turmoil?
