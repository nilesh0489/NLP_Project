What's next: Firing on Fort Sumter?   Nine Republican state legislators saythey back a bill to arrest any federal officials who try to implement Obamacare, the Journal Sentinel's Patrick Marley reports.   This is a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court. But that's not enough for Rep. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), one of the Gang of Nine, who told the Campaign for Liberty he would back legislation to arrest federal officials who took steps to implement Obamacare in Wisconsin. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, he still believes that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.   "Just because Obama was re-elected does not mean he's above the constitution," he said. No, but here's how it works, Rep. Kapenga. The Supreme Court decides that. And led by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, it has.

This states rights issue thing was pretty much decided when Lee surrendered to Grant. These legislators need to get a grip, read the Constitution and move on to working with federal officials, not threatening them.
