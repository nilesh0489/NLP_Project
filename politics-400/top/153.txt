James Franco My father gave me "As I Lay Dying" when I was 14. I loved it -- the structure, the style, but also the characters. I'm so used to learning about people through conversation, and this book is a great example of how you can understand character so differently. I thought "As I Lay Dying" was like a puzzle. For me, as a teenager, it was much more difficult to figure out what Faulkner was trying to do -- so it became a mystery I was obsessed with, something I wanted to unravel.
