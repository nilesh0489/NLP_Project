Dick Morris visited the Hannity show tonight to explain how he got it so wrong with his prediction of a “landslidey” Romney win. After blaming Hurricane Sandy and acknowledging that he got it “dead wrong” about the demographic turnout, Morris made a jaw-dropping admission. That his prediction was designed to help turn around Romney’s failing campaign.

Morris hinted at what was to come when he said early on, “I called it as I saw it from the polling and I did the best I could and I also worked very hard for Romney.” That right there is disturbing. Morris is billed by Fox News as a “political analyst” and is usually introduced on the air, as he is in this segment, as “former Clinton advisor.” And he did not disclose that he was working for Romney when he made his predictions, at least none that I saw.

But later, Morris openly admitted his prediction was an election ploy:

Sean, I hope people aren’t mad at me about it… I spoke about what I believed and I think that there was a period of time when the Romney campaign was falling apart, people were not optimistic, nobody thought there was a chance of victory and I felt that it was my duty at that point to go out and say what I said. And at the time that I said it, I believe I was right.

In other words, don’t hold a grudge because I was only trying to help the home team.

But there’s good news for progressives in Morris’ latest prediction at the end of the segment:

Could there be any better indicator that good economic times are ahead for the country, President Obama and Democrats?
