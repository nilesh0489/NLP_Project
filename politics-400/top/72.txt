At an event in New York City Monday evening, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company's Model S sedan has been named Motor Trend's Car of the Year. The all-electric sedan, which I reviewed for Slate earlier this year, was a unanimous choice, beating outÂ the Porsche 911, the new Ford Fusion, and the Honda Accord, among others, said Motor Trend Editor in Chief Ed Loh. This is the first time in the award's 64-year history that it has gone to a car without an internal combustion engine. Loh said the award was based on the car's overall excellence, not simply the fact that it's electric. He pointed out to me that it's the fastest American-built sedan on the market, posting 0-60 times as low as 3.9 seconds. Add in its handling, ultra-quiet motor, and the fact that it requires no fuel, and Loh said it was an easy pick for the honor.
