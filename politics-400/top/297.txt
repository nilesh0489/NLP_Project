On November 9, 2012, United States District Court Judge John C. Coughenour certified a nationwide class action case against Papa John's International, Inc. with potential damages over $250 million. The lawsuit is brought on behalf of Papa John's customers across the United States who were sent unwanted text messages that advertised Papa John's pizza. The ruling paves the way for what could be one of the largest damages awards ever recovered under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The class action lawsuit contends that 500,000 illegal text messages were sent to Papa John's customers across the country. Papa John's customers could be awarded $500 or more in statutory damages for each text message.Â
