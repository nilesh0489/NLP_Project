In 2004, Bush received 62,040,610 (50.74%) of the popular votes and 286 electoral votes, while Kerry received 59,028,444 (48.27%) of the popular votes and 251 electoral votes.

In this election, Obama received 61,711,576 (50.52%) of the popular votes and 332 electoral votes, while Romney received 58,508,804 (47.90%) of the popular votes and 206 electoral votes.

Kerry therefore received .37% more of the popular vote than Romney and 45 more of the electoral votes. Why isn't anyone screaming, "Mandate!!!"?

ETA: More curious as to why it's not happening; not so much supporting the idea that it should be happening.
