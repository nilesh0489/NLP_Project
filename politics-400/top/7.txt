I'd gladly pay an additional 50c or so per pizza to know the people making and delivering my food are insured. It seems ludicrous that they didn't do that earlier. I like their pizza, but am less inclined to go there now that I see what kind of a hissy this choad is throwing now that his employees are entitled to health care. Edit: a lot of people have asked where I got the 50c figure from... I misrembered the story! Mea Culpa! The fact that it is only 11-14 cents only makes my original sentiment that much more relevant. A dime and a nickel to insure a worker is a ludicrous thing to get bent out of shape about.
