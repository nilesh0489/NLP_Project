Oh, Fox News. Right on schedule, Fox is first to come up with a crazy-ass conspiracy theory about the Petraeus resignation. And it all revolves around "Benghazi", because "Benghazi" is the conspiracy theory of all good and upstanding batshit insane Republicans, so Rupert Murdoch and Fox News just wanna throw that one out there. It would be irresponsible not to just make stuff up, right?
Just as impressive as the quickness of getting their first conspiracy theory on the air was how quickly the hive mind coalesced around it—again, possibly because Fox News only has two or three stories they can parrot at a time, so everything either gets dumped into one of those bins or ignored completely
