Well, Texas, you have done it.

As of 3:40 p.m. ET, more than 25,000 Texans have already signed the petition on The White House website to let Texas peacefully secede from United States of America and “create its own NEW government.”

The petition, created on Nov. 9, argues for secession, stating:

According to The White House, the petition must reach 25,000 signatures within 30 days in order to be considered.

“If a petition gets enough support, White House staff will review it, ensure it’s sent to the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response,” explains the website.

Just last week, Rick Dunham explored differences between the U.S. and Texas that could lead to secession in his piece ‘Will Texas secede from Barack Obama’s America?’

And according to BuzzFeed’s Zeke Miller, Texas is not the only state whose residents are petitioning for secession, but is leading with the highest number of petitioners. Check out his list here.
