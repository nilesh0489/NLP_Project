One of the biggest stories over the past week has been the record diversity in the electorate and the role that played in helping propel the president to victory. That very diverse electorate also voted to send the most diverse Congress in history to Washington — more women, more LGBT people (including the first ever openly gay Senator), more religious diversity, more racial diversity, and more younger members. The new Congress is still older, whiter, and more male than the country as a whole, but the incoming Congress will at least look a bit more like the rest of America.

The House Democratic caucus will not be majority white male for the first time ever. Meanwhile, the Republican caucus actually grew less diverse.

ThinkProgress’ Adam Peck, Scott Keyes, and Zack Beauchamp took a look at some the faces that will be coming to Washington for the 113th Congress. Here’s what they found:

First non-theist Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ-09) First Hindu Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI-02) Ami Bera (D-CA-07) First Buddhist senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI-SEN)

LGBT Tammy Baldwin (D-WI-SEN) Mark Pocan (D-WI-02) Mark Takano (D-CA-41) Sean Maloney (D-NY-18) First bisexual Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ-09) First openly gay person of color Mark Takano (D-CA-41)
