At the Washington Ideas Forum Wednesday in the Newseum, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) spoke about a historic moment earlier in the day.

“For the first time, there was a traffic jam in the Senate women’s bathroom,” she said. “There were five of us in there, and there are only two stalls.”

Last week’s election means a record 20 women will serve in the new Senate.

“It’s wonderful,” Klobuchar said. “There has been a group of us, 17, that has dinner every other month in the Strom Thurmond room, which is kind of funny.”
