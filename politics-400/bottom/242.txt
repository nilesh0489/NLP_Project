(NEWS CENTER) -  Charlie Webster, the controversial chairman of Maine's Republican Party, announced last week he will step down at the end of this month when his term expires. 

Webster won praise in 2010 for engineering the Republican takeover of the Maine Legislature - the first total GOP control in Maine in forty years. But last week, Democrats won back control of the House and Senate by decisive margins, and Webster has received some criticism as a result.

Tuesday, Webster talked with NEWS CENTER's Don Carrigan about ending his four-year tenure at the Republican Party, his view of the election loss and what the change in the balance of power in Augusta will mean for Maine.

The Republican State Committee meets December 1 to choose a new chair.
