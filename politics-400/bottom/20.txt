United Parcel Service will no longer give money to the Boy Scouts of America, joining other companies that have stopped funding or have spoken out against the organization's prohibition of gay members or leaders.

UPS confirmed Monday it has changed its policy on charitable gifts to require that recipients have a non-discrimination policy that matches its own.

While UPS stopped short of saying the policy change was aimed at the Boy Scouts, the youth organization is the only one UPS had given to in the past that would be affected, company spokeswoman Kristen Petrella said.

Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith said in a written statement that UPS's decision will hurt communities.

"We are disappointed to learn about this decision but respect everyone's right to have and express a different opinion," he said. "Unfortunately, this decision will have a direct impact on the youth we serve ..."
