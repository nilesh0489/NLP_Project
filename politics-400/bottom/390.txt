The Washington Post  reported this week that President Obama is considering Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) as the next Pentagon chief and in response, Fox News wasted no time in running what looked like campaign opposition research on the Massachusetts Democrat. In a segment on the Post story today, Fox recalled baseless charges that the group “Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth” used to attack Kerry during his campaign against President George W. Bush in 2004. Back then, the group, funded by Republican donors, was widely criticized and its ads  were debunked.

Yet, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly called the matter merely a “controversy” during the 2004 campaign, saying they had “challenged” Kerry’s record. The segment also rehashed Kerry’s “ botched joke” in which he said in 2006 “you get stuck in Iraq” if you don’t get a good education (Kerry  apologized for the comments). Watch the clip:

The Swift Boat claims are no more true now than they were in 2004, when Republicans like like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) immediately  came to Kerry’s defense and slammedSwift Boat’s ad:

Not surprisingly the group’s funders turned out to be  conservative heavyweights. The New York Times  reported at the time that the group running the ads “received the bulk of its initial financing from two men with ties to the president [Bush] and his family.”
