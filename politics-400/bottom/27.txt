Now correct me if I am wrong but this part of the ACA says to me that the 50 full time employee threshold is based on full time employees AND total hours worked:

‘‘(E) FULL-TIME EQUIVALENTS TREATED AS FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES.—As added by section 1003(c) of HCERA Solely for purposes of determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer under this paragraph, an employer shall, in addition to the number of full-time employees for any month otherwise determined, include for such month a number of full-time employees determined by dividing the aggregate number of hours of service of employees who are not full-time employees for the month by 120.
