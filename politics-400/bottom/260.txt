Democrats are now on track to net eight House seats, as the party on Friday took the lead in a yet-to-be called Arizona race.

With election officials continuing to sort through uncounted ballots, Arizona Rep. Ron Barber inched ahead of Republican Martha McSally, who had been holding onto a small lead. The latest tally has Barber up by 486 votes. The race is one of seven whose outcome has not been determined.

As of Friday afternoon, the Associated Press had called 194 seats for Democrats, and had them leading in all seven uncalled contests. The AP had called 234 seats for Republicans.

Should those results stand, it would mark a small shift in the House. Democrats went into the election with 193 seats and Republicans with 242.

If Democrats gain eight seats, the party would need to net 17 seats in the 2014 election to attain the majority.

Here’s a rundown of the races that remain uncalled:

Arizona’s 2nd District. Democratic Rep. Ron Barber leads Republican Martha McSally 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent with 100 percent of precincts reporting.

Arizona’s 9th District. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema leads Republican Vernon Parker 47.9 percent to 45.8 percent with 100 percent of precincts reporting.
