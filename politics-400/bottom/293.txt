So okay, we really, really hope this is the last time we have to mention this creepy Mittens guy but damn: Romney toldrich donors that Obama won the election because he gave out "gifts" to all those pesky moochers and victims  - you know, blacks, Hispanics, women, young people, "children of illegals” - so they can do moocher victim things like go to school and see doctors and make lives for themselves. Sheesh, you'd think they consider themselves Americans or something. What a clueless schmuck. There's already an ObamaGifts hashtag. May this be the end of all things Mitt.

Update: Now even Republicans want Mitt to please go away.
