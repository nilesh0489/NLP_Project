George P. Bush seems to have a bright political career ahead of him, and he may be kicking it off as Texas land commissioner. His father, Jeb Bush, sent a letter to his supporters informing them that he's "considering" running for the position, which "overseas [sic] the mineral rights, commercial real estate owned and sovereign submerged lands of the State of Texas as well as veterans affairs and historic archives." The former Florida governor adds, "I hope you will write a personal check" to George P.'s campaign, though the younger Bush's campaign strategist says, “no firm decision has been made.” Either way, it can't hurt to have some campaign cash on hand.
