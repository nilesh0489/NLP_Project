You know, it’s truly sick of southern Republicans to be acting the way they are.

First, they failed in voting President Obama out of office because not all of America subscribes to their hatred and racism. Second, they scream secession.

What if this “letter” was sent to Texas from President Obama?

Do you think these idiots wanting to “secede” from our great country get it? If not, they ought to read the above.

I suppose they suffer from some psychological problems.

Third, they want to impeach the president.

Let me sum this up.

Not a damn thing helps the unemployed in this country, the same people Mitt Romney kept crowing about. In essence, they failed in defeating the black man. I say this because their actions prove every single day what their true feelings are.

And this should not be ignored. It should be called out and made to look foolish, sick and insubordinate to America and its principles.
