In an abrupt turnaround, Maine GOP chairman Charlie Webster has told the Portland Press Herald that he no longer intends to investigate why some people voted in his state last week despite not being white. He also apologized. "It was my intention to talk not about race, but about perceived voting irregularities," Webster said in a statement. "However, my comments were made without proof of wrongdoing and they had the unintended consequence of casting aspersions on an entire group of Americans. For that, I am truly sorry."
