Our Galtian overlords are none too pleased by the reelection of the Kenyan-in Chief, as evidenced by this spectacularly dick move by Murray Energy, a coal company in Ohio:

The Reddit poster, who said he worked in a warehouse for a coal company, didn’t identify the company, but we can tell you: It was Murray Energy, a coal company based in Ohio and run by our old friend Prayin’ Robert Murray.

For those just joining us, we’ve written about Murray a number of times. He’s the guy who forced miners to take unpaid time off to attend a Romney rally and who insisted that his management staff donate to the company’s pro-Romney PAC. Murray Energy, like many other coal companies, is having a tough time in an energy market increasingly dominated by natural gas. But Robert Murray doesn’t admit that. Robert Murray blames Obama.

The letter isn’t on company letterhead, but it’s clearly Murray’s handiwork. The day after the election, Murray announced layoffs of 54 miners in Illinois and 102 miners in Utah. In each case, Murray used the language in that letter. As the Deseret News notes:

In its statement, UtahAmerican Energy [a subsidiary of Murray Energy] blames the Obama administration for instituting policies that will close down “204 American coal-fired power plants by 2014? and for drastically reducing the market for coal. “There is nowhere to sell our coal, and when we can, the market prices are far lower,” the statement said. “Without markets, there can be no coal mines and no coal jobs.”

It prompts the question, of course: What would Murray have done if Romney had won? The reasons the coal industry is struggling would continue to exist under any administration. It’s likely, though, that Murray wouldn’t have tried to use the layoffs to score political points.
