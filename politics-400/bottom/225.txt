(CNN) – Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Lungren of California will lose his battle for re-election against Ami Bera, CNN projected Thursday, meaning Democrats will pick up another seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Vote tallies from the Sacramento County elections office show Bera leads Lungren 51.1% to 48.9%, with a raw vote margin of 5,696. Bera's win gives Democrats a net gain of four House seats, with another four House seats still too close to call. Democrats maintain a slight lead in each remaining contest.   A fifth unresolved House race in Louisiana will pit two Republican incumbents against each other in a December 8 run-off election.

The balance of power in the House now stands at 234 Republicans and 197 Democrats. Before the election, Republicans held 242 seats and Democrats had 193.
