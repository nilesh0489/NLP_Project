Tea Party favorite Allen West is vowing to pursue "every legal means necessary" after a partial recount showed his Democratic challenger, Patrick Murphy, is still the unofficial winner in their bitter House race.

The Florida race is one of a handful of U.S. House contests still undecided nearly a week after Election Day. Republicans will continue to hold power, regardless of the outcome.

West, a GOP firebrand and prolific fundraiser, picked up some votes Sunday in Florida's St. Lucie County. But Murphy is still ahead by 1,907 votes and 50.3% of the vote -- six-tenths of a percentage point ahead of West. That's not enough to trigger a full recount.

Sean Domnick, Murphy's lawyer, says it's time for West to "step aside and let Patrick Murphy do the business of the people."
