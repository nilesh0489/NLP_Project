They’re meeting with too-far-right-for-the-Tea-Party activist Field Searcy to discuss how President Obama hates the suburbs and is using a mind-control technique developed during the Cold War to implement United Nation’s Agenda 21, a non-binding voluntary UN resolution which the Republican Party opposes in its platform and many conspiracy theorists see as a plot to eliminate property rights.

Thanks to watchdog group Better Georgia, you can view some of the contents of a four-hour meeting convened by the Republican Majority Leader of the Georgia State Senate, Chip Rogers. The video above samples the nearly one hour that Better Georgia’s Seth Clark caught on video before he was escorted out of the chamber.

Sen. Rogers had co-sponsored a failed resolution that sought to “recognize the destructive and insidious nature” of Agenda 21.

The appearance of Fox News personality Dick Morris, humanity’s worst political pundit, adds an extra layer of hilarity to the proceedings, as he cherishes any chance to promote his new book—which is about UN conspiracy theories. It’s important to remember that Republicans are literally buying these theories, along with the Glenn Beck blue jeans.

As Bobby Jindal seeks to make Republicans “stop being the stupid party,” this is what he’s contending with.
