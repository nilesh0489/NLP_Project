Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert has shut down the super PAC he started in 2011 to call attention to current campaign finance regulations, he announced in a letter Monday night. 

Colbert cited the death of the “Ham Rove,” the fictional character that was designed as a parody of Republican strategist Karl Rove. 

“Due to Ham Rove’s timely passing, I am announcing that Colbert Super PAC is shutting down effective immediately. During this time of mourning, we ask that you respect our privacy, and more importantly, the privacy of our money. It wishes to stay out of the public eye, so please don’t go trying to find it. Rest assured, you won’t. We have a really good lawyer,” Colbert wrote in a letter posted on the Web site of his super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow.

After receiving approval from the Federal Election Commission, Colbert formed his super PAC in 2011 to draw attention to loosened campaign finance rules. 

“I am a man of faith. I believe that Ham Rove in a better place now … and so is the money. I hope you have faith as well, because that’s all you’re ever going to know for sure,” concluded Colbert in his Monday letter.
