Grover Norquist, who has demanded pledges against new taxes from members of Congress, is counting heads.

While still-unsettled races could change these totals, here’s where the tally stands for his Americans for Tax Reform and its influential anti-tax pledge:

— Current pledge-signing members of the House and Senate: 279.

— Returning pledgers plus pledge-signing freshmen in the 113th Congress: at least 264.

That said, there are still some big names on the list, such as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp and House Speaker John Boehner.

Here’s what Boehner said today on the subject of taxes: “Because the American people expect us to find common ground, we are willing to accept some additional revenues, via tax reform.”

“Shoring up entitlements and reforming the tax code — closing special-interest loopholes and deductions, and moving to a fairer, simpler system — will bring jobs home and result in a stronger, healthier economy,” he said.
